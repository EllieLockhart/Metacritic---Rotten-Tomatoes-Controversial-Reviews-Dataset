Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes the foundation left by The Force Awakens for the latest trilogy and rips it up completely leaving behind a cobbled mess in it's wake for what will potentially be another four movies.\\n\\n The movie introduces lore and characters too quickly\\, without explanation or justification. A tendency to undercut any serious plot point through the overuse of cheap humour leaves The Last Jedi scrambling to achieve the tone of the greater Star Wars saga. The Last Jedi struggles to leverage the mystique of Luke Skywalker\\, who despite being the focus of the first film of the trilogy is absent from the latest installment; instead we are treated to the real world mischieveousness of Mark Hamill. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi will delight children and merchandising executives at Disney; those looking a more meaningful Star Wars experience watch almost any of the other movies instead.","true":true}
