Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't say I'm a hard core Star Wars fan\\, but I am a follower of the movies. I will even go on a limb to say that Episode 1 wasn't that bad.....but this movie was just hard to watch. I can't get past that none of the Star Destroyers couldn't over take an old rebel cruiser. Then there was just the general common sense questions\\, gravity for the bombs\\, killing time on a gambling planet while the fate of the alliance rests with you getting back\\, why the heck don't all the storm troopers use plasmas armor\\, never heard of auto pilot\\, and I could go on and on. The story line had so many possibilities but Disney messed that up also. I firmly believe that all the positive comments are people who were involved in making the movie.","true":true}
