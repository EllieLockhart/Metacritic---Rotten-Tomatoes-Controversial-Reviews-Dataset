Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. When i left the theater opening night\\, i wasnt sure how i felt. It wasnt good and it wasnt bad. After i watched it a second time\\, i tried to like it\\, and give it another chance. After letting it marinate after two showings\\, i absolutely hated the film. Nothing was satisfying. The Last Jedi has made truly appreciate the prequels alot more\\, and its the FIRST STAR WARS BLURAY i havent pre-ordered\\, and i dont plan on adding it to my bluray collection. Its the 1 star wars movie that needs be deleted from the saga. I have great faith JJ Abrams will save us with Ep 09. Hopefully people will learn from the Last Jedi\\, and move forward!","true":true}
