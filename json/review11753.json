Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How disappointing.\\n\\nThe entire 2nd act could have been cut\\, it was boring and completely unnecessary\\, especially if the Admiral had *SPOILER*  JUST TOLD POE WHAT THE PLAN WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE!!  My gf fell asleep\\, and I was struggling.\\n\\nThe mighty Luke Skywalker has spent the last few years In a massive grump on a deserted island and does NOTHING for almost the entire film.\\n\\nChewbacca is there for comic relief\\, and Princess Leia is Mary Poppins.\\n\\nAwful.","true":true}
