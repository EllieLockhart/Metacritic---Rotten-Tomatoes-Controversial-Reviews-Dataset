Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE LAST JEDI\\, written and directed by Rian Johnson\\, was one of the BEST experiences I\u2019ve had at the movies\\, and in any Star Wars film to date. Of course\\, it\u2019ll never compare to EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or A NEW HOPE\\, but Rian does his best to tear apart the expectations that were put on him after JJ Abrams\u2019 THE FORCE AWAKENS. We should credit Johnson for not recycling old plot lines and actually making an effort to surprise the audience (whether they agreed or not\\, you wanted different and you got it!). Star Wars is about family\\, yes\\, but the Skywalkers are just one family. Imagine all the other tossed-aside kids who are one with the force? There\u2019s already so much potential for new stories\\, so it makes sense that Disney would ask Johnson to helm a separate trilogy. Don\u2019t go into this movie thinking it\u2019ll be like the previous films. Go in with an open mind and ENJOY the movie! It is FUN\\, full of humor and heart\\, plus\\, it even features one of the best fight sequences EVER (comes just at the end of Act 2). Go take the family and have fun!","true":true}
