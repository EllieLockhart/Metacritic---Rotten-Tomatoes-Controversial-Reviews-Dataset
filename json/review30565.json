Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up for an account just to review this movie for two reasons; 1\\, I'm really getting tired of how badly skewed the Rotten Tomatoes critics are (I wish we could review them) and 2\\, this is by far my least favorite Star Wars movie ever (yes I liked Episode 1 better).\\n\\nFrom the very beginning this movie gave me a feeling of \\\"this is just stupid\\\" and just when it would have a moment of awesomeness (yea there were a few) it would be marred with \\\"really? that's where they're going?\\n\\nI don't want to reveal any spoilers so I won't go into specifics but there was a whole lot of bad with not near enough good sprinkled on to make it a worthwhile movie.  At least I did the double feature so my ticket price wasn't completely wasted since i got to see Episode 7 in theaters again but I've already returned the tickets i had bought to see it a second time.\\n\\nI'm really glad JJ is coming back for Episode 9 and I'll likely wait for bluray for Rian's non saga trilogy since I think he really s**t the bed with this one.","true":true}
