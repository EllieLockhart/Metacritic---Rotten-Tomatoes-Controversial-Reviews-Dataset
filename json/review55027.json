Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a die hard fan since my parents popped in New Hope in the VHS in the home I grew up in back in 93'. And as fan I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I've suffered through my fair share of indignities for the sake of this epic which it very much is. It encompasses so much more than just the Skywalkers and the Solos\\, and those stories are just as good if not better in their own right and they deserve to be told\\, and I do hope their time will come. Star Wars though from the beginning was always about the Skywalker clan\/family\\, to ignore that and to not give it its due proper especially in a trilogy that was supposedly the sequel in the SKYWALKER SAGA... To all fans\\, the Luke that we were all hoping to get in this movie is not the same Grand Master Skywalker from the books. He is weak\\, hes given into fear\\, hes.... turned himself off to the force.... No self respecting fan would ever treat this movie\\, no this whole trilogy as nothing more than fan fiction\\, and the worse kind at that I'd say. When Luke tosses the Heirloom blade of the Saga away at the start of the movie I should have just got up and left\\, but no the real last straw when I really should have left is when Luke asks Rey \\\"Wheres Han\\\" .....  Also Star Wars Rogue One had a way more tasteful and less cringeworthy colored milk reference in their film already so don't know why that scene was nessa... The Porgs... You guessed it\\, they don't do squat\\, at least the Ewoks and the Gungans did something. The end is on a flourish of absolute nonsense and shock that it leaves even people that call themselves both Rian Johnson and Star Wars fans shocked and in a state of incredulity. Most knowledgeable Star Wars fans will remember this film as the worse one within the film series and mythos (even if they don't want to\\, like for real personally would rather sit through the Holiday Special than watch this travesty a second time) for much time to come\\, many Rian Johnson fans (myself included I guess\\, hard to forgive what he does in this film the shite wanker) will see this as his first shite film hes ever made\\, and it truly boggles the ever-loving mind how it turned out to be his Star Wars film\\, ain't that a kicker. Well to sum up it was a complete set of bastards who decided to green light this garbage. Don't see it\\, no real fan will want to talk to you about this movie in conversation because to us we really don't want it to exist. This movie is a heart break. The Last Jedi simply sucks.","true":true}
