{"101487":192982,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. Every technical aspect in this movie was wonderful\\, the execution was beautiful\\, the performances were great\\, and they were all let down by a terrible script. Incredibly flawed character choices aside\\, even the flow of the film was off. It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie\\, there was so much going on and not once did the movie stay with one of the three mini movies it was running to let a scene or storyline breathe and hang. The scene with Rey\\, Kylo and Snoke should have been one filled with tension and yet all of that was ruined because every minute we were cutting away to another storyline. Perhaps older movies have pacing issues and letting a scene hang for too long is flawed\\, but this kind of choppy structure leaves for no tension and no emotional connection with the story. The audience can never ground themselves in a setting long enough to care. Who did the script edits? Why did they not make structural changes? And then we get to the terrible character decisions\\, such as the assassination of Luke Skywalker. An iconic character who in the OT\\, saved the day with love\\, hope and forgiveness...then tips Ben Solo over the edge by seeing him as a lost cause? A brief lapse of judgement is believable\\, everyone has those\\, but his entire attitude towards Kylo goes against the real Luke's strengths. How could Luke Skywalker see the hope and potential for good in someone who had already done as much bad as Darth Vader\\, and yet not see hope in someone as young as Ben Solo\\, before he had even crossed to the dark side? Ridiculous. If they had made an effort to show how Luke had changed and ended up a different character before this took place\\, then it would be believable\\, but they give us nothing. Mark did a fantastic job portraying Luke even though he also hated the script\\, but Mark was the only part of Luke in TLJ who was actually\\, you know\\, Luke.\\nThen you move on to all of the \\\"pay-offs\\\" we were promised. People complain that TFA was too much of a re-hash\\, but at least it was setting up for something. All TLJ did was give us answers that erased everything TFA began\\, or alternatively just completely forgot about everything TFA set up. Did Rian hate TFA? Does Rian simply just hate Star Wars? You have to wonder.\\nRey's parents being nobodies was obviously coming\\, as soon as the movie kept pressing it so much\\, but I can't help but hope Kylo lied because it's such a let down. To create such a big deal out of Rey's identity\\, to toy with the audience for two years only to reveal she's related to nobody\\, it's simply pointless. If she was meant to be a nobody then there would be no point teasing it. I don't care if she's related to Jar Jar in the end\\, just give her some sort of connection that can add emotion and believability to her raw power with the force.\\nPoe's storyline\\, though possibly the most boring of the three mini movies\\, was the strongest in terms of feeling like Star Wars. He was the only character I liked what they were doing with\\, and yet they still weren't doing much. Separating him and Finn was a bad choice. Rose is wonderful and very likeable\\, but felt forced in just because Rian didn't like any of the pairings created in TFA. I'm so pleased to see an Asian woman as a lead in Star Wars\\, but they should have kept Poe with Finn and Rose along that journey. Combined those two storylines better\\, instead of keeping them so separate. That would have created less jumping around all over the script and helped the flow. Not to mention Finn being demoted from main character (and incredibly charismatic lead) in TFA\\, to a side character with borderline nothing to do in TLJ.\\nDJ left no impression\\, considering he was supposed to give a big twist to the plot. I'm honestly hoping he plays a decent part in the next movie\\, not because his character was particularly stand-out\\, but because then his character would actually have any use...at all. The kind of betrayal twist DJ served is meant to leave an emotional impact. I was surprised\\, as were the friends who saw it with me\\, but we weren't betrayed as an audience or let down. If you want to pull this sort of trick why not have a third member be with Finn and Rose from the start of their journey\\, and then be the one to betray them? Make the audience feel something. Create a betrayal with emotional payoff\\, not just because there was a betrayal in ESB and the formula asks for it. If you're feeling really adventurous\\, make Rose be the one to betray Finn\\, breaking audience's hearts and then creating new and fresh tension for the next film. Just do anything that isn't boring or emotionally flat.\\nAnd then we get to Snoke...the joke. I'm not the biggest JJ Abrams fan\\, but I feel so bad for him having to watch the mess that was Snoke dying halfway through this movie having accomplished nothing. Was there any point to him? Doesn't seem like it. We don't know where he came from\\, and he's certainly not going anywhere. Thanks for nothing\\, scriptwriters.\\nThe movie was enjoyable\\, if only because it was stimulating. If only because so much was happening that you weren't even allowed to breathe for a minute to consider the fact that none of the script made any sense. If only for seeing the characters we know and love. If only for special effects that will get a deserving Oscar nod.\\nIt was entertaining\\, but it wasn't good\\, and it certainly wasn't Star Wars.\\nFingers crossed JJ has the balls to start the next movie with Finn waking up from his TFA unconsciousness having dreamed the messiness that was The Last Jedi.","true":true}
