Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO LIGHTSABER ON LIGHTSABER BATTLES! They literally killed anything that was interesting from the force awakens and featured lengthy\\, stupid\\, and pointless subplots that only made the characters look like idiots. The casino scene could have been cut out. It only made things worse.\\n\\nThe lesbian admiral that kills everybody just to suicide herself at light speed. Witness meeee!!! If anybody should have sacrificed and become a martyr it should have been Leia or even Admiral Ackbar who just fucking died and that's it nobody gave a shit. #itsatrap ??The instaforce messenger communication between Rey and Kylo was hilarious. They must have verizon.\\n\\nSnoke was a dumb ass with no back story. Lazy ass writing decided to kill him off instead of giving us any background on him. Snoke is so powerful he manipulates Rey and Kylo yet he can't sense the light saber on his side moving when he literally just said he can see what Kylo is thinking.\\n\\nRey was definitely a Mary Sue on this one. She only trained by herself for a day after grumpy\\, coward\\, alien beast titty sucking\\, don't give a shit Luke didn't\\, and she's suddenly at Kylo Ren's level who's been training for years and about to complete it. I didn't care that Rey's parent's were nobodies cuz the Skywalker family isn't the only one that can use the force\\, but how is she that strong? Must have a shitload of midichlorians.\\n\\nPointless goofy force ghost Yoda cameo. Bombs dropping in space cuz fuck it\\, what happened to gravity? Superman zombie Leia\\, annoying porgs\\, oh yea Chewbacca was there. oh yea\\, r2 and 3PO were there too. Luke acting completely off character\\, he saved vader cuz he still sensed good in him\\, but wants to kill Kylo cuz he sees evil in him. Luke Astral projecting into battle to still die anyway.\\n\\nForced (pun totally intended) Avengers style humor that fell flat.Obvious Empire and Jedi\\, scenes copied that totally failed (Rey's \\\"training\\\"\/ Snoke's death just like Palpatines on Empire\\, useless Walker scene at the end). Phasma the new disappointing Bobba Fett. Rose kills everyone cuz she's got a boner for Finn who's just friendzoning her lol! #RIPstarwars #thelastjedi #starwars #sucks #fuckdisney #jumpedtheshark #supermanLeia #fuckporgs","true":true}
