Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It Just could of been better. really need to go back and remake the 7th. the CGI\\, HOW IT WAS FILM WAS NICE BUT THE STORY WAS JUST SAD.  JUST DON'T LIKE IT AND WISH THEY WROTE IT BETTER. OR JUST KEPT THE eu WHICH IN MY OPINION HAS MUCH MORE DEPTH AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.   Even Mark Hamill did not like the script. Wonder if its to late to go back to the EU","true":true}
