{"101487":196788,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-26","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the visuals\\, music and performances by Carrie Fisher\\, Mark Hamill and Oscar Isaac are great\\, that's really where the praise ends. The plot made little sense\\, the script felt rushed\\, and attempts to \\\"subvert audience expectations\\\" left fans angered while ruining continuity. In summary\\, the movie just doesn't make sense. Things like tracking through light speed\\, Luke\\, the hero who left his training to save his friends isn't willing to go back to save his sister\\, along with twisting the memories of the childhoods of many make The Last Jedi the worst star wars since Attack of the Clones. The first movie I ever saw was A New Hope\\, and as a lifelong star wars fan\\, i don't like the fact that this movie was made intentionally divisive\\, to piss classic fans like myself off. The worst parts of the movie were the fact that Rey's parents are nobody\\, you know everybody thought she was strong and powerful because she was a Skywalker or a Kenobi\\, that could possibly explain her abilities\\, but no\\, its just that she's nobody\\, as well as the Casino subplot which was really only to give Finn a purpose and story in this movie as he does very little else\\, it was boring and felt like the prequels. It ends with absolutely nothing accomplished except pissing off the conservative audience. All in all\\, the Last Jedi is the embodiment of everything wrong with modern Disney Star Wars.","true":true}
