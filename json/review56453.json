Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director completely dropped all of the plots from the force awakensThey basically turned Luke into some lunatic hermit who attempted to murder his nefew. Then killed him off before he could pass on any wisdom to Rey. I'm all for diversity I love that they made a female the hero. I'm glad they also put some new diverse characters in the films. I think all Star Wars fans are. remember Leia was was one of the first strong female leads. I understand it's time to move to the next generation and that our hero's will die no problem there. The problem is the director decided to shit all over Luke and the original trilogy right before killing him. Also I really loved The Force Awakens and the fact that the director decided to just throw away very intriguing plot lines.","true":true}
