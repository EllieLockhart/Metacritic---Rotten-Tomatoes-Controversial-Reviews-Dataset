Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"deus ex machina after deus ex machina\\, Destroys narrative established by original trilogy\\, destroy narrative of a force awakens\\, destroys the content of luke character.  Pretty obvious attempt to rebrand Starwars for a disney cash grab. Not worth your time.\\n\\nSimilar opinions more well explained\\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LPsRp7uUXUk&index=5&t=941s&list=PLrWEuyjp0Im26IVktQleH5Ixt5yqI5mXL\\n\\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D81f1M7IwSg","true":true}
