Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It isn't a terrible movie just isnt very good.\\ncringy dialogue\\, plot holes\\, no continuation of lore! Snoke's backstory is excluded from the story\\, Rey's parents are irrelevant\\, and where are the knights of ren\\, huh? And that one scene at the start (i think you all know the one) is just so weird and unnecessary. It trivialises the 'force' and is just so awkward. Without spoiling anything\\, it just makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film if they come back\\, and its worse for episode 9 because now they can't solve that problem either which would have been conveniently solved had the scene been followed-through with\\, its a mess. Its near the same level as batman v superman martha scene. There is zero depth in this film\\, sure the action sequences were perfect but its without substance\\, all flash. Humour was alright\\, but even that felt a little too obvious and unnatural compared to harrison ford and ewan mcgregor days. And it stems from a typical disney problem where characters are too superficially fantastical (i think only Poe and Rey had adequate character development).\\nHonestly can't believe they're getting rian jhonson to direct a new trilogy SO BAD. Rotten tomato user reviews already dropped 30% and IMDB is hammering it now - can't believe critics are still holding at 90%+ when this film is a failure to fans. Just watch the film and then watch angry joe's angry review (spoilers): https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=09tTlVQ3VfY&t=3s","true":true}
