Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi have been the only Star Wars moves that I have only seen once.  I have lost all desire to finish this story.  They have killed any passion I had for this universe.","true":true}
