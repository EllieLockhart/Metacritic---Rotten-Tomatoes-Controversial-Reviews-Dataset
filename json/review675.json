You take control of several teenages who have returned to the location where 2 of their friends went missing the previous year for some sort of closure\\, but unfortunately for them things get stranger and darker... I did enjoy this game a lot\\, but I felt that the end was a bit rushed and the amount of QTE's made some of the more suspensful scenes feel too regimented and in turn\\, less suspensful. If it allowed me to climb up walls within the caves myself\\, or run and jump\/crawl in real time\\, rather than pressing X or Y when prompted\\, I think I'd would've felt a lot more immersed. On top of this\\, the game relied far too much on replaying the game to try and discover certain clues regarding the background of the characters and area you're in. This meant that by the time I finished the game there were a lot of unanswered questions and I didn't feel an urge to play through it all again. Overall\\, Until Dawn is a good game and definitely worth playing if you're a fan of puzzle and horror games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
