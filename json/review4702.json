Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete garbage. Force Awakens was good\\, not great by any means but it felt like old school Star Wars. Last Jedi ruined Luke's character and had far too many prequel type comedy moments. The opening scene with Luke throwing he saber over his shoulder and then milking a walrus type creature set the tone for a terrible movie. The plot is a rebel ship is running out of gas but the New Order can't catch up to them. Lol. It's pathetic. Terrible characters too with no chemistry too. Unreal","true":true}
