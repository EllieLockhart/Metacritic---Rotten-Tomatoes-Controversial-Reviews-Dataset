Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The combat\\, the visuals\\, and the music were fantastic and the movie could have been superb except for a few things.\\n\\n- The marvel movie humor.  No thanks.\\n- Making Luke into what he was.  No thanks.\\n- Rose and that entire storyline.  No thanks.\\n- Purple haired admiral.  No thanks.\\n- The repetitive derailing of what the men wanted to do vs the women.   No thanks.\\n\\nThis really edges on white males vs minorities to an obnoxious degree.","true":true}
