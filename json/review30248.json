Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw the movie 3 days ago. It's still bothering me on how bad they ruined this movie. Force awakens set them up so nicely and they completely social justice warriored the hell out of this. Chewy is not a vegetarian. Not all females are powerful. Not all men are idiots. Luke would never lose a fight to untrained people. Ghosts can't cast lightning. F U for ruining this","true":true}
