Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The main problem in this film is it almost completely ignores what 'The Force Awakens' was setting up. Rey's parentage\\, Snoke as an interesting villain\\, the Knights of Ren\\, the friendship of the three new main characters\\, Rey finding answers or training... there were enjoyable moments but they were spoiled by the bad taste in your mouth with how they missed obvious opportunities or flat out crapped on them.","true":true}
