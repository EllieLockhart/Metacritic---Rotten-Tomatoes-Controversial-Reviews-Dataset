Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelievably bad!! WTH can Disney do any worse! Strip everything out of lore to make this unbelievable movie a canon movie! Slap in the face to everyone who loves Star Wars. Why would this crap be any better than any other story? Why not let Qui Gon Jinn kill off the Count Dooko\\, the emperor or Vader in attack of the clones!? The Yoda scene is unbelievable and shouldn\u2019t be lore! Your also telling me they can fire blasters until well they are dead but can\u2019t find a way to power a ship the same way? Just a couple of complaints the only reason I\u2019m giving it two stars is because they did do a good job on special effects!","true":true}
