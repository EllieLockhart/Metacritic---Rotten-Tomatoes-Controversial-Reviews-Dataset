Best graphics of this generation I'd say. Simply stated\\, the game is worthy of the 10s that its received across the board.Don't listen to the people trying to hide their political and intolerant views by trying to disguise it with fake takes and opinions on how the game is.It's clearly obvious that there is an effort to tank the game by a certain group of people.
