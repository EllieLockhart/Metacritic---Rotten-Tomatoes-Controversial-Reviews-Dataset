Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time seeing the movie\\, I thought but it was pretty good. The Star Wars effect wore off and then I went to see it again and all I think was \u201cwhy?\u201d There are many plot holes once you outline everything and there are new characters that are thrown in the mix that aren\u2019t very thought out (Rose). Not nearly as good as the original trilogy and barely better than the prequels. Disney seems more concerned about selling merch for cute creatures than making a down to earth Star Wars film. Nervous for a whole trilogy from Rian. ","true":true}
