Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers below \\n\\nHalf baked every character\\, idea\\, and plot. Should have been easy to really make everything develop to satisfaction given that the movie was like 12 hours long (Seemed like) \\nEVERYTHING with Leia's character should have been cut. \\nFast Space Goats should have been cut.\\n10-30 cheesy lines should have been cut. \\nLuke's character should have had 1\/2 the lines he did. I almost used my soda straw to gouge out my eyeballs after I saw Luke brush off his shoulder. \\nTraining Rae took 1 try with each thing. \\\"Here try something you haven't heard of until 7 seconds ago. Great you got it\\\" There wasn't anything to root for in anticipation. \\nBB8 hot-wiring the mini AT-AT was the second cheesiest thing I have ever seen. It's right behind Leia's scene where she force pulls herself out of space back to the ship. \\nSnoke was the worst villain ever. We could have gotten a very smart and powerful being\\, instead we just got powerful. \\nI own all other star wars on DVD\/Blu Ray\\, you couldn't pay me to have this one in my collection. I've seen Force Awakens 12+ times. I'll be watching that today to get this taste out of my mouth.","true":true}
