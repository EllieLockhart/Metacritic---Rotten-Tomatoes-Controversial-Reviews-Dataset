Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow.. first of all lall the fans wanted was for Luke to be given justice.. even if it was for a minute.. just a taste of something but nope.. not only did we not get that\\, in return we got the worst possible version of Luke we could have asked for. A freaking broken shell of his former self who's a b****. \\n\\nSecond what the hell was the point of snoke? I mean Snoke aside can we at least pretend like Force Awakens happened? The hell? \\n\\nI mean what the hell was this mess?","true":true}
