Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars franchise is officially dead.  It's now a platform for social justice warriors...putting that aside...the plot was not original\\, but a knockoff of the empire strikes back\\, but doesn't come close to the magic that movie had...horrible...disgusted...worse than Jar Jar Binks...","true":true}
