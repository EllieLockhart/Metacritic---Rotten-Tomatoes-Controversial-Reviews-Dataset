Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was such a horrendous mistake. From the beginning to the end. This was clearly a case of SJW work that ran amoke. The story was horrible\\, the characters were horrible outside of checking off the diversity boxes it should be scrapped from the universe all together. Actually so should be the last one. This movie combined with awakens officially killed Star Wars for me. I don't care if they ever mak another. I was hoping after the really good Rouge One this might turn the corner but politics destroyed this move and franchise.","true":true}
