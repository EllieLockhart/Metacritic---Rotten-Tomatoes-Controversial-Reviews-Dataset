Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I might not like some of the outcomes in this episode it still kept me entertained and on my feet.   However with life we are always thrown challenges nd obstacles.  The story is a natural progression of the saga that we have to face one day.  I believe the movie delivered on all levels..  i would recommend a second viewing for anyone having doubts about this movie.","true":true}
