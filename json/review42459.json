Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a great one\\, just not a great Star Wars movie. It was a real disappointment with the way Luke Skywalker was portrayed (even Mark Hamill said so). It had so much going for it that it could have been the best and most successful movie of the franchise but it really fell flat in so many ways. I am genuinely not as excited for Episode 9.","true":true}
