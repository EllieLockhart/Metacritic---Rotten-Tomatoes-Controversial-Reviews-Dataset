Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so much potential and only ended up being awkwardly funny\\, horribly written and left major characters with zero back story and basically leaving the audience to there imagination as to who the fuck they were or came from. The movie made no sense especially since its supposed to be the 2nd part of the trilogy to the force awakens. No questions are answered only more are brought up. What was once an amazing story gets shredded in a fucking blender only to start something new and different. If you are a true star wars fan than i feel sorry for what your about to see or already saw.","true":true}
