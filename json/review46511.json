Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched first in regular and then in IMAX. Had a much better appreciation for the film the 2nd time around and completely blown away by the special effects in IMAX. Aside from a couple moments like Leia floating in space and the Rose kiss at the end\\, I really enjoyed this film and like the direction Star Wars is headed. Luke and Kylo performances were both fantastic. ","true":true}
