Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, the dialogue was amateurish at times\\, but the plot was both fresh and comfortably familiar. The connection between Ben Solo and Ray was creepy and interesting. Their connection was the most interesting thing in the movie. Ben's inability to carry out several tasks showed a tiny spark of humanity that can maybe be tamed later. The CGI was great and the humor was well received. I'm not sure why others felt disappointed\\, this is Star Wars\\, not a Woody Allen movie. It's supposed to be fantasy\\, not Shakespeare. Take your family\\, ignore the bad reviews\\, they'll have a good time\\, there's plenty to cheer and a couple of places where you're heart will break...especially all the mothers out there.","true":true}
