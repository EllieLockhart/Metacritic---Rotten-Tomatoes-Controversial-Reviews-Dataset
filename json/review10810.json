Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hard to believe that any fan of the original films could like this one. I thought VII was bad until I saw VIII. GAPING plot holes\\, cookie-cutter\\, made-for-the-masses crap sandwich. I'm surprised they weren't selling Porg stuffed animals in the lobby. Not giving anything away\\, but there's a \\\"prank call\\\" sequence early in the movie that seemed like a parody of Star Wars they'd do on SNL or The Onion. Cornball one-liners throughout during heavy situations. And don't even get me started on the propaganda! Hopefully\\, the side stories like Rogue One continue to deliver because the main trilogy films have lost the magic of those Lucas touched. If this was a Star Wars movie\\, then I'm a Pentecostal preacher!","true":true}
