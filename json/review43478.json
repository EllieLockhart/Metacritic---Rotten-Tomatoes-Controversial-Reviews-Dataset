Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a very different Star Wars movie... It did not pander to the crowd... It was bold and turned a lot of speculation as to what was expected on its head... This movie had humor\\, suspense\\, action\\, and drama... The acting (with a few exceptions) was superb... Mark Hamill was particularly amazing in this... His best acting ever... \\n\\nThe low audience score seems to spring from shattered expectations of those who 'just knew' that their theories were going to pan out... No one's theories pans out in this... So I see where people may be a little bitter... But here's the thing\\, a movie that is predictable is like a a food that you eat daily... It's filling and comfortable and you like it because it's exactly what you expected... But trying new dishes expands the pallette... This movie has expanded my Star Wars pallette... And that says a lot... I've been a huge fan (you have no idea) since 5-25-1977... I've been to all but one (Denver) Celebrations... Literally tens of thousands of my dollars has went to Star Wars... If I can appreciate this movie so highly then you can consider my evaluation valid... I think that many will come around once they 'let go' of their predeterminations... It was different\\, it was amazing\\, it was Star Wars... Loved It... Going back for 3rds today... Chuck","true":true}
