Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the plot line mirrors Empire (like TFA did a New Hope)\\, the story is fresh and exciting! New Force abilities\\, taken from the \\\"Legends\\\" books\\, may have some people confused and frustrated. As will some questions not being answered. Keep in mind the \\\"big picture\\\" and you will enjoy!","true":true}
