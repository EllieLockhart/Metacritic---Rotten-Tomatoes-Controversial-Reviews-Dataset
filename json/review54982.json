Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was... bad :<\\nI was realy realy disappointed\\, because:\\n1)It was all but action focused\\,\\n2)The good motifs ended natural cause after more or less 20-30 min.\\n3)Ther was so much more potential in this film\\, but the way director lead action just end it in a disappointing way.\\n4)not so ghosty ghost of Skywalker makes little sense\\n5)The scenes of combats... Why people in it attacking one by one\\, not all?\\n6) NO FORCEFIELD\/AIRLOCKS in the bombers! So there is sir in space?\\n7)New disney princess motif. (goodbye moonmen playing in the background of my head when Leia fly)\\n8) NO SENSE in empire\/first order tactic. NO SENSE!\\n9)Ugly combat scenes with bullet time\\, and focus on running legs (kylo vs Lucke)\\n10)Last scene- ending of movie lucks horrible. Like a painting of  Last supper\\, or moneyshot with all of actors for magazine.\\n\\nI am very upset. BUT! I will go once more. This time focusing on other things. Maybe it will change my judge\\, but I do not think so.\\nIt was not horrible movie\\, but at the same time it was no near good movie.","true":true}
