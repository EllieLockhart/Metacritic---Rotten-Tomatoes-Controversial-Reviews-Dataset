Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJW and Third Wave Feminism agenda bullshit. Poe is hated on for being a white male. Finn is useless. Phasma dies pathetically. Snoke is wasted and killed off for not paying attention... seriously\\, it is bullshit. Leia has space fairy Force Powers and are never shown\\, relevant\\, or mentioned again. Kaylo is... passable most of the time. Rey is a Mary Sue. And Luke Skywalker is gutted and his character destroyed completely and utterly. \\n\\nThis movie is the ultimate 'Fuck You' to any and all Star Wars fan out there.\\n\\nFuck this movie. Fuck this movie. Fuck this movie.","true":true}
