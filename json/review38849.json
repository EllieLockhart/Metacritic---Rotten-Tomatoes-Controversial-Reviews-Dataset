Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They have offically killed the Star Wars. Becasue of The last Jedi and The Force Awakens\\, I don't even go to the movies anymore. Not just for Star Wars\\, but for all movies. I am a huge Marvel and Star Wars fan and because of Force Awakens\\, I did not see Doctor Strange\\, Thor 3\\, Rogue One\\, etc. in the theater.","true":true}
