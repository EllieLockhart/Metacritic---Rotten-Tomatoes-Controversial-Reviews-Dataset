Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh take on the franchise that doesn't pander to nostalgic sentimentalities. Structured around a strong narrative  : a chase and a show-down. Featuring character dynamics taylored to generation Y and their yearning for validity. Unpatronizing in its treatment of the star wars legacy. A movie with \\\"good-bones\\\" that will at least take you on a great visual journey.","true":true}
