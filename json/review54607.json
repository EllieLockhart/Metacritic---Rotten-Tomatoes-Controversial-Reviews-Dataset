Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry\\, but the reviews by these critics is Fake News\\, clearly bought be Disney.  Go take a look at the audience reactions.  This is the least liked Star Wars film ever\\, more than Phantom and AOTC!  This film has a lower rating that AOTC and Phantom. Poe Dameron has an interesting character arc? That guy is a terrible actor. He leads a mutiny for no reason whatsoever. Finn? He's off with some Asian girl that involves him leaving\\, travelling to a planet\\, attempt to find a code-breaker\\, get arrested\\, find a code-breaker\\, escape\\, flee on some weird camels\\, and then get captured by the First Order\\, all within a 5 hour period! That's idiotic. How about the FLYING Princess Leia? How about Snoke not being able to see a light sabre move and turn towards him\\, despite demonstrating the most powerful force skills every seen? NO LIGHTSABRE battles. Telekenetic powers. Force ghosts that can interact and \\\"interfere\\\" despite the fact that they are not supposed to \\\"I cannot interfere Luke\\,\\\" Rey's parents are nobodies\\, yet\\, she is more powerful than any Skywalker? Impossible. Brianne of Tarth\/ Captain Phasma looses a battle against Finn in 5 seconds. The First Order fires one shot at a time against the Resistance Ships when they have a legion of ships and fighters. One shot at a time! Ice dogs that exist to show an escape out the back of a base that nobody thought had a back door. Yeah\\, a real good movie.","true":true}
