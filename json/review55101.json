Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was a bit afraid of Last Jedi just being a remake of Empire. It sure has its Empire moments and also some Return of the Jedi ones. But it has so many plot twists and emotional scenes that I am struggling in deciding if this is my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. \\nI love the performances\\, specially from Hamill and Ridley\\, not to mention Carrie Fisher.\\nThere is only one scene that I think went over the top and was so extreme that I do not think even the force justifies that. I do not want to give any spoiler but when you see it\\, and you think of Mary Poppins\\, then you know what I am talking about.\\nWe lose one character before we get real answers\\, but hell\\, the movie had to be 3 hours to solve everything. Hopefully we get them in IX.\\nOn the other hand\\, this film has the most awing scene of all the franchise's flicks. So much that the sound is actually muted\\, no special sound effects\\, no dialog\\, no epic music\\, just the epic visuals and the emotional charge of it.\\nThe movie lasts more than two and a half hours and I still was sad it ended. It kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole time.","true":true}
