Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I watched this movie at midnight I thought it was okay\\, but not a lot made sense. The humour was too forced and in your face\\, floating Leia. I rewatched it a couple of days later\\, more awake\\, and relaxed\\, and wow\\, it was like a whole new movie. It makes sense (apart from Mary Poppins) it was well filmed and the story is fresh despite what the haters say. Love it\\, and I will be watching it again and again","true":true}
