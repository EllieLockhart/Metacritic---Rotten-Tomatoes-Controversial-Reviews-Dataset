Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"GARBAGE\\n\\nONLY TOO THING IS CAMERA WORK AND PROPS\\n\\nSTORY IS  STUPID-LONGEST CHASE SCENE I HAVE EVER SEEN\\nKYLO AND SMOKE ARE DIFFERENT PERSON FROM FORCE AWAKEN\\nLUKE IS OUT OF CHARACTER\\nGENERAL HUX IS A JOKE CHARACTER NOW\\n\\nLAZY WRITING\\nLUKE'S MAP\\,HOW SMOKE MEET KYLO\\,KYLO NEED TRAINING\\,SMOKE WANT REY ALIVE\\nEVERY MYSTERY BOX FROM FORCE AWAKEN WAS DESTROYED BY CUCK JOHNSON\\nSOME NEVER EXPLAIN\\,SOME CONFLICT WITH FORCE AWAKEN","true":true}
