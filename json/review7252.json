Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining movie in of itself but a shambles as a Star Wars movie. Subversion for subversions sake. Rather tell new stories in the same universe (ala Rogue one) than decide on the 8th part of an intended 9 part story that you want to \\\"go in a new direction\\\"","true":true}
