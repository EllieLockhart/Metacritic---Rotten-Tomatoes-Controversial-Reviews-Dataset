Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold in its story direction\\, but unconfidently so; it would take leaps down unexpected paths only to make awkward jokes as if unprepared or too insecure to let the weight of its choices sit with the audience for moment. O.K. movie.","true":true}
