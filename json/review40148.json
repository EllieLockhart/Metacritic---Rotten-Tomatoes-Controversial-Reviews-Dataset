Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not just a critique of the movie. I share the same sentiment many have already expressed. This half star is also a rebuttal to the 92% positive \\\"Critic Score\\\" received by Star Wars Episode VIII. I've long been an advocate of Rotten Tomatoes but seeing scores like this for a movie with so many flaws makes me question the legitimacy of professional critics.","true":true}
