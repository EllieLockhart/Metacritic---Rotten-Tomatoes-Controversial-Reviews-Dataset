Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, amazing amount of hate for this movie. I love that the criticism of TFA was that it was too similar to ANH. Well now Johnson goes and diverges considerably from the formula and fan go crazy that it's too different. The fact that this movie's fan rating is currently lower than Batman vs. Superman is all the evidence I need to disregard half the ratings here. Johnson took a lot of chances and I loved it.","true":true}
