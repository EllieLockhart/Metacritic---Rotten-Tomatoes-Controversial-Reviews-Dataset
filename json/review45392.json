Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very bad. Disney is killing the story they just made a comic movie for kids who are not fans and who do not care what Star Wars is.\\nSpend year imagining how would be Luke after the return of the Jedi imagine him as a true powerful Master and not the desepcion of old man.\\nThe worst is a supreme leader who is nobody.\\nThe truth came out sad after seeing so many negative comments in the cinema and in me they ended up with a great saga. The package is big.\\nOnly a MIRACLE could save this in episode IX","true":true}
