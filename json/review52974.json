Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A rollicking good time for fans and new commers.  Skywalker brings humored not seen in the saga before for that character and Po Damerin doesn't disappoint taking over for the vacancy left by Solo's rebellious nature.  The conflict and relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is developed in a way that leaves you wondering and wanting more.  Another film that doesn't disappoint from the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
