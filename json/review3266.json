Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful visuals don't make up for sloppy storytelling that ruins well-established Star Wars mythology... someone needs to give Ryan Johnson and Lucasfilm a copy of Campbell's The Power of Myth\\, or maybe they could just read over the scripts for A New Hope\\, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi","true":true}
