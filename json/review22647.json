Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked it in the theater\\, but has gotten progressively worse after every subsequent viewing. Plot points just don't add up to an overall theme at all. The characters don't grow and change and there's no \\\"journey\\\" for any of the heroes. The movie seems obsessed with subverting expectations to the point where that's the only recurring theme. Rian Johnson has an extremely poor sense of humor. The canto bight sequence is prequel-levels of cringe but with added political messaging. Rotten to the core.","true":true}
