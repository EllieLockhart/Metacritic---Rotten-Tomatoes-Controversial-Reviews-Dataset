The review bombing is definitely unwarranted.\r\rWhere Part II falls down is some clumsy writing that pulls you out of an otherwise immersive story with a stunningly crafted visuals world and excellent gameplay. Some of the character motivations are just completely plot-driven and feel so forced as to make some of what you are doing - or rather\\, why you are doing it - feel stupid and a little too unbelievable. Similarly\\, the pacing was a little clumsy with the game falling off a cliff at the mid-way point.\r\rAlso - the decision to have a heavily pregnant woman travel out into hostile territory on patrol and have her climbing about and fighting etc. was... well just plain weird. I'm all for body positivity - but that was completely insane.\r\rI don't have a problem with any of the characters themselves and disagree with most of the negative reviews. But some of the writing is definitely just plain bad.\r\rVery much hope TLOU3 can be a thing. It's a great world that deserves more storytelling.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
