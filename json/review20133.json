Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't bad\\, but it sure was not good.\\nA bit slow at times: some aspects of the plot and characters didn't quite flow as they could have.\\nStill\\, lots of great action\\, emotionally satisfying scenes and well acted characters (that could be given some more space though).\\nA really good Star Wars movie\\, more original (but not as original as some think) than Force Awakens with better action.\\nCould have lost a couple pounds in the edit.","true":true}
