Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were right things and wrong things- and of course\\, things that may not be as clear as they seem.  The endless YouTube theories of the last two years\\, of course\\, made it harder for them to make a film that lives up to so many hopes and expectations.  Some of the writing seems downright lazy\\, though I do think certain decisions Johnson made were kind of brave.  I'm a bit disappointed- I wasn't amazed\\, or blown away\\, and didn't leave the theatre with that elated feeling I want from these things. but what of it?  We expect too much from movies.  It was okay.  How in hell were they supposed to really surprise us with so much internet noise breathing down their necks\\, though?  That's a problem.  Here's hoping that 9 somehow ties it all together well\\, and that there are still impressive surprises possible at this point. . .","true":true}
