Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"really extraordinary. Its true thats it is really different than the orginal films. But it doens't bother you because its refreshing. A new kind of story with new problems but there are still refrences to the past and thats just utterly amazing. This movie also suprises you in ways you coudln't imagine. This movie is there for the star wars fans who are open minded and appreciate new things. Because this movie was above my expectations.","true":true}
