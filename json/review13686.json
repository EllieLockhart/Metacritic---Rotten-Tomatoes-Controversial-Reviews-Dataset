Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I hadn't seen this movie for free I would be pissed.  The worse Star War movies made to date.  They pulled a classic bait and switch with this movie.  The trailer has cool star wars icons and gives the perception you'll get everything you loved from the old star wars but it is nothing like Star Wars of old.  I understand people liked it because it throws out everything you though you knew about star wars but why no have the trailer reflect that? Lastly\\, with politics in this country being so polarizing its nice to go to the movies and forget the real world for an hour or two. Unfortunately\\, the director and writers of this movie are political activist.  Most movies do have some kind of social or political message but they are normally subtle. This movie throws it in your face for the entire duration of the movie and they sacrifice the what could have been a good story in order to promote a political agenda.","true":true}
