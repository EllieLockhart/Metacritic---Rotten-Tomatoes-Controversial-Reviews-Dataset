Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite many disappointing flaws in characterizations and the narrative\\, The Last Jedi is still a strong and explosive installment to the Star Wars universe\u2014packed with risky and intriguing storylines\\, powerful performances\\, nostalgic scenes\\, brilliant plot twists\\, impressive action sequences and breathtaking visuals\u2014and has a dazzling quality to outshine some of its predecessors and maintain the legacy.","true":true}
