{"101487":139729,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I SEE RED - My Review of STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (3 Stars)\\n\\nFull disclosure:  I'm the last person you should be listening to as I review any STAR WARS movie\\, or any fantasy movie for that matter.  They all have pretty colors and exciting set pieces.  Some have memorable characters.  But I can barely keep up with the lore and can't tell a Boba Fett apart from a Boba Tea.  I kinda just go with it and assume that good will battle evil\\, leaving one or the other the victor with each installment.  Having said that\\, I think THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a bonafide masterpiece and got more of a kick out of THE FORCE AWAKENS than I did the OG Episode 4\\, but going into THE LAST JEDI\\, I didn't remember a thing from the previous film except that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was about to make his long-awaited return.  Oh!  And I recall a major character biting the dust\\, but for the two of you who haven't seen Episode 7\\, I won't spoil it here.  \\n\\nSince THE FORCE AWAKENS felt like a beat-by-beat retread of THE NEW HOPE\\, I expected THE LAST JEDI to resemble THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\\, especially with Rain Johnson\\, no stranger to dark material\\, on board as writer\/director.  While it doesn't quite go there\\, it does achieve a tone of melancholy all its own.  One can credit the late Carrie Fisher's final film appearance for much of this\\, but Hamill's wonderful performance adds a healthy dose of gravitas.  \\n\\nSince I probably won't remember the story by the time the next installment comes around\\,  won't describe it here.  Our heroes fight the Evil Empire\\, or the First Order\\, or whatever the hell they call it now\\, and nothing short of the end of the universe is at stake.  Our new young cast (Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Isaac\\, John Boyega and Adam Driver)  basically replaces Luke\\, Han\\, Leia and Darth Vader somewhat respectively as light saber and spaceship battles ensue.  The plot ping pongs around from character to character so often that I couldn't remember who knew whom.  An introductory scene at the end between two major characters took me by surprise as I shrugged\\, \\\"They hadn't met already?\\\"  Laura Dern has a fairly large role but I didn't think she looked right for the part.  Her acting style is grounded in so much painful reality\\, that I had a hard time recognizing her as a future action figure.  Same goes for Benecio Del Toro.  STAR WARS characters aren't usually played by Method Actors!  Don't get me started on the waste of Gwendoline Christie and Lupita Nyong'o.  Like\\, I said\\, I am THE WRONG person to review this movie!\\n\\nFor the most part\\, I enjoyed this overlong film very much.  It contains many beautifully shot set pieces\\, especially a great light saber battle in front of a big bred backdrop and another face-off on white soil which gets smeared with red salt.  There's a LOT of red in this film\\, which allows it to have its own identity of sorts.  The others don't tell this color story\\, so I'll always think of this installment as the red one.  \\n\\nWhile all of the STAR WARS films contain humor\\, and no\\, I don't consider Jar Jar Binks a successful stab at it\\, the jokes here\\, right from the opening scene on\\, feel different.  Some moments wouldn't feel out of place in SPACEBALLS\\, whereas in the past\\, the humor came from our expectations of its characters.  We knew Han Solo would say something snarky\\, because he was a snarky snark.  Here\\, we get a slight Monty Python drollness based on silly circumstances.  Personally\\, I enjoyed it as welcome levity to the plethora of dire\\, hopeless events.  Driver's Kylo Ren seems louder and angrier now as his relentless assault on his enemies bears the hallmarks of a ruthless dictator.  Kim Jong Ren much?  When not cracking wise\\, this film gets dark and metaphysical.  Issues of mortality\\, of giving up\\, and of passing the torch give it heft\\, perhaps too much so for a popcorn flick.  \\n\\nFor those who look to the STAR WARS films for its toy collectibles\\, absolutely nobody will regret putting a cute little Porg or a Crystal Fox on the shelf next to their BB8.  It's the entire experience\\, in fact\\, that I think people remember.  The toys\\, the fandom\\, the colorful battles\\, the speeding X-Wings\\, the trying to figure out when Prince Harry appears\\, all just may mean more to people than the actual storylines.  Yes\\, this film has a wonderful twist and a surprise cameo from a fan favorite.  Yes\\, the universe finally feels truly diverse\\, with the great addition of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)\\, a terrific new Asian character\\, but for those still thirsty for a Poe\/Finn hookup\\, you're gonna have to settle for a strong hug and meaningful eye contact!  Finn has his eyes on someone else\\, I'm afraid.  \\n\\nSo all of this is to say that I liked this film very much while not really understanding or remembering it at all.  Just lots and lots of glorious red!  Rian Johnson may pretty much color inside the lines of the Star Wars Universe\\, but he does infuse the film with his own brand of weightiness.  Some will embrace it\\, while others will...wait for it...rebel.","true":true}
