Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't think it is possible to make a worse movie.... Or piss off fans more than they already are. This movie.... Ugh\\, this movie was so\\, so\\, so very bad. I would rather be forced to watch all thee prequels again.... One after another... Than watch one second of this movie again. ","true":true}
