Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not a fantastic movie by any stretch\\, nor is it a great story. There are so many blunders that outweigh the great few moments. Many totally unnecessary scenes and sequences that contribute nothing to the film. Moments of ridiculous marvel-esque humor that ruins many good moments. Disney is really doing a number on Star Wars.My biggest issue with rotten tomatoes nowadays is the critics  no accolades or any kind of storytelling background. Yet\\, they are the ones deciding what a good movie is\\, it's ridiculous.","true":true}
