Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie with terrific CGI. Felt like they only cared about making money and not making a quality film. The film lacked common sense and had so many plot holes. They also blew off so many chances for character  development and creativity. I tried to logically like it\\, but I couldn't. I will not be giving my money to the Star Wars saga anymore and encourage people to vote with their dollars and keep kids away from this franchise as well. Disney has soiled Star Wars with this soulless trash.","true":true}
