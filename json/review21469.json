Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would go to say this film is as bad as Episode 1\\n\\nOpening crawl will give you goosebumps (that's a given)\\nThis film feels like a massive \\\"Fuck You\\\" to everyone who waited 2 years for answers posed by The Force Awakens. I'm not saying there's not answers\\, there are\\, they're just really underwhelming and shit. \\nRey's story arc is the only one with minor purpose\\, while every other characters' is pointless.","true":true}
