Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Different but good. Doesn't matter what the whinning \\\"fans\\\" say. It's a great movie. Maybe the best adition since the original trilogy. The only flaw was the lenght and -for some- the sword fights ( I say \\\"some\\\" because it's not like the overchoreographed  duels of the prequels. Which is a minus to some)","true":true}
