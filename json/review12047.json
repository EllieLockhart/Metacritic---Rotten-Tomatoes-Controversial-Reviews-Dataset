Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually enjoyed this movie. Sure there are some stupid scenes were they went for laughs such as when Luke threw the lightsaber and the casino scene. But other then that I enjoyed it\\, the movie had many cool scenes such as the throne room and the part were Finn fights Phasma. Overall I had a fun time watching this movie.","true":true}
