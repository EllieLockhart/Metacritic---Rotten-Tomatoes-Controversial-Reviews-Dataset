Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a decent enough film by itself if it was completely unrelated to Star Wars\\, but it was not a good Star Wars installment to the saga. Critics are giving it way too much praise from what it deserves and it should not be at 90 percent rated fresh. There are many other films out there that are much better than this one that do not have such a high score. That should be a clear indication that this film is being overrated by critics.\\n\\nRegarding what I thought of the film itself: there was too much forced humor\\, it disregarded everything that was being set up in the previous film\\, we learned absolutely nothing about Snoke\\, and the director\/writer depicted Luke as a loser that gets an anticlimactic end. The film felt far more like a Star Wars fanfiction than an episode of an Epic Saga that George Lucas would have made. That's just my two cents on the film. I'm no \\\"Professional Movie Critic\\\" whatever the hell that means (like it's even a real job). So you're free to take their (completely unbiased and unpaid) word for it about this film\\, or just another normal Star Wars fan's like mine.","true":true}
