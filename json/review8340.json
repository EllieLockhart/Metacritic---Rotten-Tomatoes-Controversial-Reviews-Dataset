Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"felt let down after seeing TLJ....Mark H carried the movie despite having limited screen time...the\/DisneyHumor parts really made things uncomfortable and it was very unlike the SW we are used to....plot holes never filled in most cases...felt like it was all just thrown together with alot of re-tread moments and new characters that had NO REAL substance in regards to the story...I stayed away from spoilers and the internet on this one so I can try and get some of that SW magic.It never showed up...Rouge One was soooo much better...","true":true}
