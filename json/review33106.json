Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"subverting expectations\\\" is not a good way to make a sequel and the character of luke skywalker was completely changed for the worse in my opinion. A lot of the movie and subplots felt so unnecessary and too many moments had me feeling disconnected from the movie or putting me in a state of disbelief such as the leia force scene. An already lovable cast was pushed aside for 3 new characters to be developed that all felt flat and 2 of are out of the rebel group now. Poe and kylo were the only characters from TFA that i liked the development of. Everyone else was developed poorly or could have been done better. Hopefully the next movie has a director who can properly make us love our characters and wrap up a clear good vs evil star wars story. Disney and lucas films has a lot of criticism to learn from and give the fans what they want.","true":true}
