Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So Good! This movie takes gamble which mostly pay off. I loved the portrayal of Luke as soured and bittered by the history and failure of the Jedi and the choice to make Rey's parents nobodies. Excellent movie\\, defiantly the best of the new trilogy and will hopefully be remembered as the 'empire strikes back' of the trilogy.","true":true}
