Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a moderate fan of the originals\\, but this movie was bad. It felt stitched together and incohesive. When the plot didn't feel pointless it was disappointing\\, with a lot of main characters being wasted. In addition to that there was some weird and goofy scenes that just really didn't fit in and were laughable. I thought it would be better\\, but there was a severe lack of good decision making in this film.","true":true}
