Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams strikes again\\, as producer this time\\, presenting this Star Wars story once more in the only style he knows how: stringing us as audiences and fans along... all the while making you believe you are being led somewhere. But in the end you always find that the reality is you haven't been taken anywhere. The story has told you nothing. And you are required to believe\\, once again\\, that all your hopes and questions will be realized in the next installment.","true":true}
