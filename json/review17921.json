Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think a lot of potential was wasted. The tone was completely different from past films with odd placement of comedy and questionable plot choices. While enjoyable\\, I feel the quality of the story was very low.","true":true}
