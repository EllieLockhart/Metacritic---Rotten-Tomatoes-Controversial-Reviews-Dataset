Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought a movie would make me dislike Star Wars fans... but here I am. Rian Johnson tells a story through compelling performances (Hamill\\, Ridley\\, Driver) and does so in a fresh way. He not only continues the Star Wars story\\, but expands the boundaries and pushes the force and the galaxy to edges it\u0092s never explored before. The people saying this is \u0093worse than \u0091phantom menace\u0092\u0094 may need to seek medical attention. The Last Jedi is not perfect\\, but a triumph nonetheless.","true":true}
