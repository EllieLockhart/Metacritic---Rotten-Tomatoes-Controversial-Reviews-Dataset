Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was way better than i thought great action humor was weaved in perfectly but there was only one thing i found wrong with it other than that i rank it in the top 3 best star wars movies.","true":true}
