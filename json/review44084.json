{"101487":189053,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ\\nSo\\, today was a holiday and I started my day off by getting into a few flame wars on FB over how badly I hated TLJ. You have some individuals that try to claim it was 'a good' or 'ok' movie\\, that belittle those that are expressing how badly we hated...even loathed...TLJ. I explain it on the basis of the movie...find moments to vent my frustration with barbs and humor...but always find myself perplexed by the fact that some people actually thought it was ok. I've been actually thinking about this\\, reflecting on it. I haven't been able to get past why those that have expressed from like for it have done so despite the horrendous writing and plot development\\, but I finally came to a decision. I'm going to take a different tact...and explain the reason not for the hate...but for the reasons as to why our hatred is so extreme. I think those that are with me on this side of the fence will likely agree with my reasoning.\\nFirstly\\, I'll be the first to admit I'm on the older side of the coin. I'm no millennial\\, etc. I'm someone that stood in line with my father to see The Last Hope at midnight\\, as someone coming into my early teen years\\, all excited about the crowd fervor. To be fair\\, I saw this at midnight...dog tired...and as a first reaction I was like\\, ah\\, it was ok. I did enjoy it...I liked it...but at first\\, I didn't get the hype. A little time passes...my interests in reading sci fi\/fantasy\\, gaming\\, etc. develop further...I start to become old enough to go to the movies on my own...and then? Then...Empire comes out! Empire made Star Wars for me. That summer\\, with day time discounts\\, I saw Empire like 21 times as I recall. From here\\, I fell in love with Star Wars. I loved Empire! And then? That's where we start to set the seeds for the explosion of TLJ.\\nI and many of my friends loved SW and Empire as a set. It was epic to us\\, Wagnerian. Luke was seen going from a young\\, nerdy kid\\, growing in abilities and circumstance to become a hero. It was all very Arthurian for us...Arthur as a child with Merlin learning\\, Arthur growing into a young King\\, and we waited to see Arthur the true Hero in the series. Then? Well\\, let us begin the litany of disappointments we have endured.\\nReturn of the Jedi\\nWe go from Wookies to Ewoks...and we go from Arthurian Luke\\, Hero Luke\\, Light Saber wielding Luke...to a somewhat disappointing ending where the Emperor is so much more powerful\\, for where the plotting makes no sense\\,...and we're left...meh\\, it was ok\\, but still...disappointed...unfulfilled.\\nPrequels\\nI can simply say...Jar Jar\\, Medaclorians (however the hell you spell that)...that says alot...but wooden dialog...dispassionate acting...etc. Again\\, we were left only disappointed. Don't get me wrong...RotJ and the Prequels had good elements. Darth Maul and the associated fight scenes were what we were looking for...some of the plotting was cool...hell\\, even the\\npolitical intrigue of Palpatine was interesting. But the underlying character development and dialog being so badly mishandled...it left our dreams of a future Arthurian universe...\\nunsatisfied.\\nThen we hear...Force Awakens is coming! JJ has the reins! We're all again...EXCITED! Old characters are coming back. A truly capable director that understand character development has the reins! A lot of us got salved in the books...in the comics...all\\, btw\\, better than much or most of what we were fed elsewhere. Hell\\, if nothing else\\, go look at the SWTOR MMO promotional videos to get a sense. THIS was what we'd been looking for\\, hoping for\\, craving. We WANT\/WANTED to have the storyline realized with the epic perspective we had for the Universe and its characters. I'll digress just to share this\\, to give a sense of this\\, as the video does...\\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mm4JEZudf0c\\nSo\\, on that...we get...Force Awakens. Now\\, let me give a balanced answer. Force Awakens...outside of Last Hope and Empire...was the BEST SWTOR movie to that point. Characters were fun\\, likeable. There was plotting\\, mysteries\\, etc. The DIALOG WAS GOOD! I forgave any inconsistencies in this except for the Planetary Death Star...but hell\\, it was the first entry into a new series\\, it had to tie old and new...I was HAPPY to have a capable director that cared and the chance to see the promise of the story delivered on. It was a VERY good start.\\nThen...Rogue One comes out! Rogue actually acted to hype expectations. I know the ending left one bummed out...but hell\\, the effects\\, characters\\, writing...EVERYTHING was the best ithad ever been. It SURPASSED even George's work! The only downside was...NO Jedi\\, just the promise of them...and it was a prequel! But...we all felt something we had been craving...hope...redemption...even hope to restore the promise of the franchise and a memory to leave for future generations that left us happy\\, of a well developed story to carry what we loved so much as kids forward. hen...then...the bottom fell out. \\nThey passed the baton from the very capable JJ...to RUIN JOHNSON. Ruin foreshadowed RUIN. I use this not so loving moniker as that is what he did. He RUINED the hopes and dreams of everyone that has so loved the PROMISE of the SW universe for so long. It was like Ruin Johnson was the evil twin of George\\, with ONLY the crappy parts present. Rather than fulfill the hopes we had held so long for a bad ass ninja King Arthur\\, Ruin gave us a Jar Jar Ewok hybrid. Rather than respecting our loves\\, hopes\\, and dreams...he set about destroying\\, shatting on\\, and disassembling everything we loved and disrespecting the hopes and memories of those that grew up with the franchise and saw 8 and 9 as the chance to redeem what George had so marginally handled in 6 and 1-3. Rather than redeeming its legacy\\, it delivered on its nightmare version\\, and threw all of it in the trashbin. So...on behalf of all of us that grew up with it\\, that had such hopes pinned to the redemption of Luke and the hope of an epic vision we craved so much\\, you tore it all apart\\, threw it on the ground\\, and fed the pieces to the dogs. \\nThank you\\, Ruin Johnson\\, thank you! And oh yea...Rian?  Stuff it!","true":true}
