Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with low expectations. They were met. \\nNot to say it didn't have it's highlights; Mark Hamill is great as is his dynamic with Daisy Ridley. Excellent visual effects and beyond lavish production means the film always looks incredible. It also wasn't just a rehash of Empire so that's good.\\n\\nI'd say pretty much everything else was a bit of a mess though. A pointless and convoluted plot involving Finn and Rose going to the Casino Nights Zone from Sonic 2\\, a baffling waste of characters and setups from previous films\\, painfully awkward humour that killed any drama and a wedge of Disney cheese sprinkled on top. And oh boy\\, THAT scene with Leia...\\n\\nStar Wars has been more of a product for decades but it's never been more apparent than now. Better than the prequels? Sure. Better than Empire? Get outta here with your paid for reviews\\, ya mook.","true":true}
