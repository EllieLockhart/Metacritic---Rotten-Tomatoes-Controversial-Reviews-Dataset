Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a personal Star Wars fan since an early age I went into this movie with high hopes! Especially due to the last movie being so great! Anyway I came out the other side feeling almost confused as to what I just watched\\, the story was butchered and there were actually scenes to which I laughed upon seeing (out of stupidity of the scene\\, such as yoda one). The story it's self had many over many pointless and worthless scenes littered throughout\\, all the previous movies stories have been ruined and whilst I'm not trying to include spoilers\\, you will leave extremely like there's is no hope (pun intended)","true":true}
