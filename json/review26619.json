Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay lot of spoilers here.\\n\\nToo many attempts at comedy moments.....2-3 would have been fine\\, not every scene. Superman Leia was crap. With just a minimal amount of editing\\, could have give Leia a great death scene that would worked and give Carrie a scene to go out as a star\\, didn't happen. The whole movie seemed like any chance they had to have a great story arc or side plot was ignored. Snoke is the big bad Supreme leader....no backstory\\, just dead. The love story angle of Finn\/Rose.....meh\\, doesn't work for me. The Kylo\/Ren one was okay\\, kinda a yin-yang thing going. Rey being a master lightsaber wielder with 1 day of training....I didn't buy it in Force Awakens\\, I don't buy it now. Luke took practice and training to be able to do what he did\\, now Rey comes along and is equal in a couple days.....no\\, just no.\\n\\nI enjoyed the action scenes\\, but I think Mark Hamil had it right when he disagreed with everything about his character arc. The acting was okay....but I think the writing was rubbish.","true":true}
