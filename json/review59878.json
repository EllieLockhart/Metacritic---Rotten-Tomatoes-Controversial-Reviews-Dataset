We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I finished my first play through last night at 32 hours. The games environment is stunning\\, the story was one of the best I\u2019ve played. The twist and turns of an emotional heavy campaign\\, had me on the edge of my seat & my heart rate up. Originally I wanted to kill Abbie more than anything\\, after the traumatic scene with Joel. I couldn\u2019t wait to get revenge on the team. As Ellie works through\\, Nora\\, Owen the pregnant Mel\\, you can\u2019t help but feel for them. Then their deaths dawns on you\\, when the shoes are on the other foot as you playthrough as Abbie\\, suddenly you don\u2019t want them to die\\, Abbie herself I ended up warming to her character. As you play fetch with Bear & take Alice on your mission. The little moments that you find yourself smiling.  The part where you run into the aquarium & the truly horrific scene of Alice (the dog) lying motionless in a pool of blood on the floor\\, the room where Owen & Mel lay\\, it hits you differently.  It really is a dark brilliant written revenge story & nobody wins. Story aside\\, The games attention to detail is phenomenal\\, the world seems truly alive. The combat mechanics are something else. Every kill with every weapon truly feels different in each environment\\, never has a game made me struggle to kill\\, but I genuinely hated killing the dogs. (I\u2019m a dog person) The soundtrack is amazing. The Gameplay on Scar island might just be the most  impressive thing I\u2019ve ever done on a PlayStation console.\r\rIn summary for me this game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It\u2019s a must play for yourself\\, even if you\u2019ve heard spoilers. Turn your sound up high & just enjoy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
