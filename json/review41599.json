Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is getting a lot of flack for its portrayal of Luke\\, but I thought it was a very logical transformation. Indeed\\, the question of why there must be light vs. dark\\, instead of neutrality\\, is one oft-tackled in the formerly-canon books and games. To have Luke\\, who was not even raised in a traditional Jedi clave\\, question the teachings of the Jedi makes a great deal of sense. And as someone who has always had strong instincts\\, to have him react before thinking also makes sense. The movie still paid homage to the spirit of the original trilogy\\, with its delightfully corny jokes\\, and struggles between light and dark\u2014it merely included a 3rd dimension in the battle between anger and control. To say that the movie destroys Luke\u2019s original character is incorrect. To say that it takes his character down a logical path of continuation\\, even if difficult\\, is much more accurate.
