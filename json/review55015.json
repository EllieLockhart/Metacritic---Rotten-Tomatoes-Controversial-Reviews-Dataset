Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was the worst experience on a theater ever. I will not support E.9 after this crap. I'm sorry for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher\\, they had to endure this poor recreation of a movie. I still can't understand how EVERY critic is saying that he Casino part shouldn't be part of the movie\\, and still give a perfect score. If you review a movie with 30 minutes bad and stupid storytelling\\, I believe that they would not give such high scores. But I think is political incorrect to downvote a story with a black actor and an asian actress. From stupid Holdo\\, holding the \\\"plan\\\" to that Luke. Luke goes from left his friends to talk to the most sadistic and evil person in the Galaxy becuase he has hope. But your nephew is lost and must be stabbed in the back\\, becuase you felt he may be tempted by the dark side. Some normal person does not even contemplate murder. \\n\\nLike Luke throwing the lightsaber over the shoulder\\, the fans will do the same thing with your lame product. Wake up Disney.","true":true}
