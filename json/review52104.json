Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the movie twice\\, the issues with continuity from TFA to TLJ are glaring. I don\u2019t agree with how Luke\u2019s character was treated\\, and the death of Snoke seemed like such a waste. Especially after J.J. and crew built him up via interviews and plot points. However I did love Carrie\u2019s scenes and the connection between Kylo and Rey was very interesting. ","true":true}
