Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is film that shatters expectations\\, particularly expectations on who we think these beloved characters are. Some people may not like that\\, but I enjoyed seeing a depth given to these characters that I couldn't even imagine existed\\, and as a result I love the characters even more. The beauty of this film is that it makes you feel something new\\, something unexpected\\, the fact that you leave the theater with such a strong feeling is a testament to all who worked to bring this film to life.","true":true}
