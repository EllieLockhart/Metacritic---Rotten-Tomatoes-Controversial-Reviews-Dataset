Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a rehash of the old movies...again.Better graphics\\,horrible story.This is a good movie for SYFY.It should have been made for tv.But they slopped it on the bigscreen.The only reason it made money is because its the only star wars movie we can watch on the big screen.","true":true}
