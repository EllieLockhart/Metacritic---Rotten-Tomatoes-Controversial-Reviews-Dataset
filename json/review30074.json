Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson\\, together with Kathleen Kennedy\\, managed to tear apart one of the few things that could still bring different cultures and people all over the world together. Careless writing\\, with plot holes beyond measure\\, utter lack of respect and care for previously established characters (I am SO sorry Mark Hamill for what they made you do...)\\, and cheap comedy tricks that utterly destroyed the impact that some scenes could be having\\, dictate the 2 hours and an half of this movie. \\nDespite having some of the most beautiful scenes ever shot in Star Wars\\, all of it is undermined by the futility of the entire film. The flaws are too many to be listed and I only feel sorry for not having the time to rant about them all.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars fan I truly wish I had never seen this film. It pains me to see this iconic saga be turned into pure eye candy that leaves you with a sense of emptiness and wasted time once it's finished. I do not accept this film as canon\\, I have no interest in watching it again (and never will) and my only regret is to not have left the cinema in the moment Luke freaking Skywalker comically throws his father's ligthsaber behind its back for some cheap laughs. A very VERY bad movie\\, that is only being spoken about because it has the words Star Wars attached to it. This is NOT what Star Wars is.","true":true}
