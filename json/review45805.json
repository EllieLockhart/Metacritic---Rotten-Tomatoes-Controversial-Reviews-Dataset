Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very poor follow up to the last two releases. Stupid jokes\\, poor story and script. To many CGI animated creatures. Looks and sounds great but that's not enough. Have lost faith in the development for this franchise.","true":true}
