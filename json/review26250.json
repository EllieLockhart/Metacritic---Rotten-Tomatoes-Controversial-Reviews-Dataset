Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not terrible\\, but not what I was hoping for.  It had so much potential\\, but just fell flat.  The story line was weak\\, but the characters kept things a bit interesting.  I might go so far as to say\\, this was the worst of the 8 Star Wars movies to date.","true":true}
