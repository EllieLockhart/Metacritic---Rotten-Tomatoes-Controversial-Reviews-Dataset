Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This could have been a pretty good movie\\, if it wasn't for everything that made it so positively terrible.\\n\\nTechnically\\, it's great. Great direction\\, great cinematography and color palettes and costume design and effects that are okay with the exception of some blatant CGI.\\n\\nThe script is where this movie renders itself the worst Star Wars ever made. It's a character assassination of Luke Skywalker\\, nothing makes sense\\, Rose is the dumbest\\, worst character yet introduced--basically the new Jar Jar Binks\\, and it's just sloppy through and through\\, not to mention outright dumb at most points. That's the thing: this movie isn't just terrible\\, it's outright stupid. For instance\\, there's literally a moment when Luke milks a space gazelle and it moans at Rey as he does so. What. The. Fuck.\\n\\nEvery time it's about to do something meaningful\\, something that will have an actual impact\\, it just ransacks it with subversion of the idiotic kind. For instance\\, when Finn is about to sacrifice himself but Rose--the idiot she is--crashes her ship into his and then spouts some nonsense about love over hate\\, which doesn't make ANY SENSE in the context of the scene\\, as he was about to sacrifice himself to save those he loves. \\n\\nThe movie blows. At one point\\, without even intending to\\, I actually gave the screen the middle finger by reflex. It's deconstructive in the most destructive way imaginable.","true":true}
