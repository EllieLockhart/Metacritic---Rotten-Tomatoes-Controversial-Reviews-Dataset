I respect if you are negative against the game we all have our differences. However there are many reasons I think the game is great\\, one of them being that despite over characters in the game being killed so quickly and that Ellie doesn\u2019t have enough time to pay attention - was think of yourself in this situation and it equals up. People will complain about character development whilst there isn\u2019t much it makes a bit sense as Ellie has already spent about 5 years with them it wouldn\u2019t really make sense for such character development as it isn\u2019t really necessary. Now the ending despite if you hate it or love it\\, it all is so real and makes sense. Ellie after killing almost all of Abby\u2019s friends as finally got the chance to kill Abby but what is the point why do it why Abby had a reason to kill Joel but most importantly will killing Abby bring Joel back of course not\\, Ellie seems to have had enough killing and is done for now. If you imagine yourself at this situation you would have more likely done the same thing. Now onto the gameplay I am glad that most of the gameplay is similar to the first game because that system is perfect however has some really good improvements now such as being able to craft more supplies to use in battle but also to improve the way you play through using supplements for a variety of stuff. The guns in this game are also so fun and enjoyable I never ended only using one gun for a encounter. Being able to use a rope to access places which we wouldn\u2019t be able to do without is amazing\\, and the prime feature is just so useful and so realistic. The graphics is this game are top notch; one of the best games to perfect graphics so far not only that but the way your clothes will change depending on what environment you are in and where you land. Your bullets can be seen having different effects and sounds on what they are hitting like I don\u2019t see this in any other game. Also I forgot to mention the small boss fights which are really nice and interesting to do it makes your heart beat especially on the harder difficulty\u2019s. The dodging system is extremely useful and so cool it make me feel like in a movie or in a situation in real life.  Sorry if i missed any stuff. One to the accessibility options I am so glad and appreciate the fact they made these so many people can experience the game whichever way they would like even if they are slightly blind or deaf. Thank you Naughty Dog. Now finally Joel dying had a huge effect on me it cause me depression for several days and still it whilst writing this. Never would I have thought a video game would have such a effect on me. Truly sad Joel died but hopefully we will soon see him in a DLC. If anyone from Naughty Dog ends up reading this - Thank you and keep up the amazing work.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
