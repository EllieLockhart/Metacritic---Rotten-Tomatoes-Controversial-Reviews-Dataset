The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game uses cheap\\, artificial\\, manipulative story mechanics\\, instead of intelligent or thoughtful characterisation\\, to garner sympathy for Abby. For example when playing as Ellie\\, you are FORCED to: (1) kill dogs (2) murder screaming wailing people\\, whose loved ones mourn and cry in terror (making you feel bad about killing them) (3) murder a pregnant woman Whereas when you are playing as Abby\\, you are FORCED to (1) play and have fun with dogs (2) defend yourself against evil scary transphobic jungle people (3) save kids People who enjoy the story are confusing SKILFUL DIRECTION with CHEAP MANIPULATION. People seem to be forgetting the Abby is a fundamentally EVIL\\, IMMORAL character that doesn't deserve sympathy In Ellie's darkest moments\\, she: (1) attacks a woman who\\, aside from being involved in her fathers death\\, also further titillates and aggravates Ellie by saying Joel died like a little **** Reacting with rage and impetus\\, she beats the woman up with a metal pipe. However\\, Ellie is visibly traumatised and shaken by the event\\, she comes back and is clearly distressed and troubled (2) kills a woman who she later finds out is pregnant. When finding out\\, Ellie's hearing fades\\, she collapses and starts hyperventilating; clearly disturbed\\, remorseful and regretful In Abby's darkest moments\\, she: (1) shoots an old man in the knee\\, who just previously saved her life and was completely friendly and warm to her. She proceeds to take VISCERAL PLEASURE in beating him with a golf club\\, torturing him for so long that she eventually she grows exhausted and needs to remove her jumper. She delivers the killing blow right in front of a screaming girl who begs for his life (2) smashes a girls face\\, and upon finding out that the girl is pregnant\\, Abby takes immense PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION at the prospect of slitting her throat. Both girls enact their darkest moments under the impetus of revenge\\, but it is clear which character takes pleasure in the idea of inflicting pain. Once you understand this\\, any meaning the story holds completely withers away. TLOU2 is not a satisfying or entertaining story experience\\, nor is it a story that even needed to be told\\, given how many other movies\\, games\\, books\\, TV shows have conveyed the consequences of revenge theme better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
