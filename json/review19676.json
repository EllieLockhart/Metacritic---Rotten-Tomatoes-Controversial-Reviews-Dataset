Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie for the first and second act\\, the third act took the story in a direction that I did not enoy. I felt I did not get even a few of the things I hoped for. the mysteries of episode 7 were destroyed or ignored and this movie gave me nothing that I look forward to for 9. I disliked Lukes character (althought MH played it very well)\\, I think it was a betrayel of who he is\/was. Not a single lightsaber battle. WTH?","true":true}
