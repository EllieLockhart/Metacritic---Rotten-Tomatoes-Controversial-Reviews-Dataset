Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is full of cutsey animals and will make you laugh if thats what you are looking for\\, but it isn't what i am looking for from a star wars film. The strong female characters are the only reason it gets such a high score it would be lower without them.","true":true}
