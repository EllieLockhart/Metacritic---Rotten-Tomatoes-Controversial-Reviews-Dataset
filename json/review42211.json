Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie simply put is bad. I could get over the poor use of Luke and the ruining of the Skywalker legacy if the movie itself had actually been well made. Sadly that's not the case\\, with stupid side plots that make no sense paired with a plot overall that is full of huge plot holes this movie just cant get a passing grade. Not just ignoring the previous movie it feels as though the current director Johnson is simply trying to undo the work of Abrams and redo his own cannon so it fits better with his anthology movies. A truly terrible movie that if not fixed in episode 9 could truly be franchise runining despite the box office success.","true":true}
