Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very lack luster\\, plot holes\\, plot armor\\, I understand it's part of a trilogy\\, but rendered a lot of useless scenes and a lot of useless screen time. Overall the worst Star Wars movie yet\\, worse than Attack of the Clones","true":true}
