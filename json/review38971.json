Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They say that it's not about the destination\\, but the journey. To that end; 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' was ONE HELL of a good trip. I eagerly await the next chapter\\, but I DEFINITELY plan to see this one again. HIGHLY recommended.","true":true}
