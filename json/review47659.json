Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When A star wars trilogy comes along you expect it to flow the original George Lucas-ian (I made that up\\, but it sounds good) narrative. The anthologies exist to try new stories with darker or lighter stylized elements. I think Rian missed the mark on this one and made the galaxy far\\, far away feel very disjointed and some of the magic was lost. I liked it\\, but only in the way I can say I liked Episode I\\, The Phantom Menace. The peril felt real\\, but the situation didn't. The action was intense\\, but ultimately unsatisfying and disappointing. The twists\\, while imaginative\\, made it more of an M. Knight Shiamylan film. To get it back on track\\, JJ Abrams has his work cut out for him. Help us JJ Abrams. You're our only hope.","true":true}
