Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does everything a middle chapter needs to do\\, advances the saga in a positive way\\, developes the characters beautifully and leaves plenty of possibilities for the future and doing it all while still being a fun\\, entertaining and great overall film. Rian Johnson was the perfect choice to continue the saga and I can't wait to see his new trilogy. The entire cast is fantastic with Oscar Issac\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver and the late great Carrie Fisher. The best performance in the film is easily Mark Hamill as he was phenomenal as his iconic Luke Skywalker. Fantastic.","true":true}
