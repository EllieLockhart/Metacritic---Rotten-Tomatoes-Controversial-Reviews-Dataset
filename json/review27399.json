Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of the three new Star Wars movies we have been given. The Last Jedi strays the furthest from what the original Star Wars trilogy captivated audiences with. \\n\\nA very lazy and boring movie. Riddled with plot holes\\, and oversimplified with cheap laughs and a shallow plot. The movie felt as though it wanted to be ambitious\\, but really had no idea what it wanted to be. If you were giving the same movie without the skin of the Star Wars universe it would have been widly pandered. \\n\\nTo it's credit\\, the movie did have some great action\/fight scenes (when Kylo and Rey joined forces in Snoke's chambers)\\, but aside from that it really lacked any charm or personality to differentiate it from any other big budget CGI profit machine.","true":true}
