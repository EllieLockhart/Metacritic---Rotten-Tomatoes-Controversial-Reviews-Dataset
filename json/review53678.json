Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For those declaring \\\"the franchise is dead!\\\"...sorry to tell you\\, but like your local football team\\, you don't own the franchise.  You're certainly entitled to your opinion on the movie\\, as we all are.  But honestly\\, if one goes to a Star Wars movie and gets everything one expects\\, exactly as one might imagine - what kind of a movie is that?   Were there flaws\\, sure.  Were there some things that didn't exactly make sense\\, sure.  Were there unanswered questions\\, yes.  If you are a true fan of science fiction\\, I invite you to watch this movie with the same open mind you watched your first Star Wars movie and let the story tellers tell you the next episode in this tale.  Star Wars\\, like life\\, is not yours to dictate - you either take the journey or sit out and watch something else.","true":true}
