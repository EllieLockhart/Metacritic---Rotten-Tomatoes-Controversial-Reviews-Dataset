Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am heartbroken after seeing this movie\\, and it's utterly disrespectful treatment of Luke Skywalker.  Every single choice for him was wrong.  And the movie delights in constantly subverting every single expectation\\, as if that is clever.  It ignores mysteries setup in the previous movie\\, diminishes the importance or several characters\\, and has a multitude of plot holes. There isn't anywhere near enough space here to point out all the flaws of this movie.\\nIt is simply a complete troll and slap in the face to long time Star Wars fans.","true":true}
