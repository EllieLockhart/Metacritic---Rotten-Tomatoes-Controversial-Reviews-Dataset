Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great and took the right direction for the franchise. People seem to find the dumbest things to complain about but honestly the plot and direction was spot on! People complained about TFA being to similar to ANH but then they complain that this movie didn't stay true to the mythology. I think this movie went the absolute right direction.  Bravo!!","true":true}
