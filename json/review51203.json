Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it!!  - this dialogue was spot on\\, the plot was great\\, the action and effects awesome\\, and the bad guy (Kylo)even has some depth to his character.  This is one of my fav Star Wars so far\\, up there with the originals.  I also like that they kept it fresh with new ideas instead of rehashing the same old.","true":true}
