As you could imagine then\\, I was only invested in seeing how this fictional world and the characters within it would develop in the sequel (whilst trying to avoid the spoilers of course).\rHere's my takeaway after experiencing this lengthy game: ND focused on furthering the dystopian angle together with a revenge-based plot driver\\, which sounds like the makings of a very compelling and tense game on paper. However\\, without balancing it with any humanity from any of its characters\\, the world just feels like a hollow sandbox for clickers\\, dog murderers and bigots with the central characters feeling artificial because their personalities and actions are just ticking boxes instead of driving a compelling story.\rIt's a real shame\\, but I just can't score this above a 4 as it just didn't work for me as a story. Full credits to the design and software teams behind it though\\, who created a super-high quality graphical experience! I heard that people who work at ND are treated inhumanely during the crunch period\\, so they deserve much much more than this for their talents!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
