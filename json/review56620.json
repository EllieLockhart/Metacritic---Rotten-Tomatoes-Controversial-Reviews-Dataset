Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the boldest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back bar none. (Sorry\\, Gareth Edwards.) Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Oscar Isaac\\, John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran\\, Laura Dern\\, Domhnall Gleeson\\, Andy Serkis\\, and everybody else give phenomenal performances\\, as always backed by a terrific score from John Williams. The action is incredible\\, and the new creatures\\, planets\\, ships\\, and so forth are a delight to discover\\, and make the Star Wars galaxy feel as open and expansive as it ever has. But the real star is Rian Johnson. He has crafted through his writing and direction an impeccable piece of entertainment: emotionally enthralling\\, visually stunning\\, and narratively challenging\\, it stands apart from all other Star Wars films as a strange but familiar\\, dark but funny\\, harrowing but beautiful film. J. J. reawoke the saga\\, but Rian reinvented it from the ground up. The galaxy far\\, far away hasn't felt so fresh\\, grand\\, meaningful\\, or magical in a long time. And I cannot wait to see where J. J. brings us in IX\\, and where Rian brings us in his new trilogy. (P.S. For those of you who may have had mixed feelings on a first viewing\\, you owe it to yourself to see it again-- I promise you'll get more out of it when everything isn't a surprise.)","true":true}
