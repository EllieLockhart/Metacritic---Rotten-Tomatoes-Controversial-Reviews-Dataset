Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just got back from seeing it a second time\\, and you know what after being a hater on the first viewing I now appreciate it and liked it...\\nYou have to realize that your expectation will never be met after so many years\\, once the shock of it is gone\\, you can now appreciate what is in front of you and it was a pretty good movie\\, except for Superman Leia and the Casino...(well the totality of the Rose+Finn plot).\\n\\nBut I am now at peace with how they portrayed Luke.\\n\\nI recommend everyone who hated it the first time to go for a second viewing\\, I am sure a lot of you will like it","true":true}
