Everything else is either mediocre or down right awful. The game play did not evolve one bit since 2013. It's still a walking simulator that's more a movie than a game\\, which would be enjoyable if it had a good story but God damn is it bad. The story simply broke my heart and not in the good way. It's like a spit in the face of the entire fan base. It's like the worst fan fiction you could possibly find. Seriously? This is what you came up after 7 years? Did Twitter write this game? It's full of plot holes and the characters you fell in love with in the first game are completely ruined and you are forced to play with the character that ruined them. I don't mind the woke stuff but when so much of it is obviously forced down your throat it feels like the entire game was built around it so if people don't like it you can pull the victim card and say that they are ists and phobes and whatever. And the director to preach so much about sexualising women in games is bad only than to put that Abby scene in the game? I can't unsee that. WTF were you thinking? I'd rather watch 2 girls one cup on repeat while eating. Let me tell you a little secret western game devs. People are playing games for entertainment and they'd rather see pretty things while doing it than ugl.. excuse me FUGLY ones! This is never going to change. How is sexualising men was never an issue? People don't like to be preached to and to be told what to think. In a video game setting\\, that choice should be always ours.\rOverall\\, I don't recommend this\\, especially if you were a fan of the previous one. maybe buy it when it's on a massive sale.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
