Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn't good. It completely screwed up Poe\\, Finn\\, Hux\\, and Luke. The cassino scene was slow and boring\\, the hyperdrive destroying the capital ships ruined Star Wars combat forever\\, and Leia t-pose flying part was very stupid. Also in an effort to subvert expectations\\, it left JJ Abrams without many of the plot threads he set up in force awakens\\, like Snoke\\, and Rey's Parents.","true":true}
