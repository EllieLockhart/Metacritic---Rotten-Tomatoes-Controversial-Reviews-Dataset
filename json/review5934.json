Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing mishandling of a wonderful franchise\\, putting disney \\ncorporate interests before actual plot development. Great acting could not save an otherwise terrible script from stumbling into a underwhelming heap by the end of its extended running time.","true":true}
