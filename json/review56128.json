Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER ALERT I've never said I hated a Star Wars movie until now. what a mess this is. it's all over the place in a bad way. Snoke killed? wtf?! nothing of his back story? wtf?! they build him up to be some mythical super power and now hes dead?! Reys parents are just lousy parents? Wtf? just a one line mention and it's over? wtf?! DJ is a wasted character and really isn't even worth mentioning. No cliffhanger?! this movie sucks and I'm a legitimate Star Wars geek. this movie is barely better than Episode 2 which has the awful love story. I was legitimately shocked when Snoke was killed but that thrill was short lived. the ending with Luke is a disgrace to the character. Disney hired Johnson to do a new trilogy?! wtf?! after this mess. I have ZERO emotional attachment to any of the lead characters. I now could careless what happens in episode 9. a huge sign the fans hate this movie is the garbage rating it's gotten from fans. I would've never believed it would be so bad","true":true}
