Some might not even consider it a game\\, since your actions are very limited in nature. If you've played any of David Cage's recent games\\, you will know what I mean. There are fixed camera angles\\, tense atmosphere\\, interaction witch specific items and the occasional dark humour.\r\rUntil Dawn is definitely not for everybody. It harnesses mechanics that 99% of games nowadays don't employ. At least not to such an extent. For example there are QTE-s that translate to split-second decisions which can determine whether your character dies or lives to see another scene. This can be infuriating but also intriguing. So your favourite character dies right before completing the game...does this spike anger or motivate you to a new playthrough? Only you can decide. Just a warning - if a character dies\\, there are no checkpoints or reloads. That character is dead permanently until a new playthrough.\r\rThat's the thing though. At least to me\\, decisions like these motivate me to give it multiple playthroughs. You're probably not going to get the same results or even the same ending. There are also loads of small clues and items you will most likely not find in your initial playthrough. They might be insignificant\\, but since you're already invested in the game\\, why not read them and get the whole backdrop.\r\rThis is running on the Killzone Shadowfall engine with occasional frame-rate dips. That means the graphics are nice enough\\, but the faces and grimaces can get downright creepy at times.The voice acting and sound are superb though. Best played with headphones in a dark room. The game is also short\\, around 5-6 hours\\, perhaps a bit more on your first playthrough.\r\rI can totally see why some people might not even consider it. It's short\\, it has QTE-s\\, very little combat and is heavily story-driven. If you like horror\\, fixed camera angles\\, decent jump scares and witty humour then maybe you should give it a try. I did and enjoyed it. An 8\/10 from me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
