Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As soon as Luke threw away the lightsaber\\, I knew the movie was going to be bad. At that point the previous film\\, The Force Awakens\\, was disrespected and tossed as well. The characters we knew and loved seemed to have been replaced with strangers\\, ala Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  They did not act or behave with the same motivations or character previously established. It was almost a mockery of what the fans enjoyed about the franchise. Subversion for the sake of Rian Johnson trying to appear clever. The heart of Lucas' vision was ripped out\\, like a corpse coming back from the dead\\, somehow changed...darker\\, colder\\, selfish.","true":true}
