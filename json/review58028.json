Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually stunning and well-acted\\, this is more like a hipster spoof of Star Wars than an actual Star Wars film.  The problems with the plot\\, story elements\\, and characterizations in TLJ are legion and have been much-discussed over the past two years since its release.  But the most glaring failure (and the most unforgivable in the eyes of many Star Wars fans) was the portrayal of Luke as a misanthropic self-exiled recluse and the hopelessly un-Luke-like rationalization given for his ostensible fall from grace.  I doubt this film would've still ended up with a 43% audience score if his character had been handled in a more thoughtful and respectful manner.  As mindboggling as it sounds\\, the director obviously underestimated just how much the audience cared about the main characters from the Original Trilogy.  The result was a film that drained all the wonder and excitement from Star Wars for the foreseeable future.  To put that into perspective\\, the three prequels weren't very good films but they were still recognizably Star Wars and managed to carry its torch into the 21st century.  TLJ is a well-produced film but unrecognizable as Star Wars and may have irrecoverably damaged the franchise for years to come.","true":true}
