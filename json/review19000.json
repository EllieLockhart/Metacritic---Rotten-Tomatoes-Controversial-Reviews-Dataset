Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's definitely flawed but it's still an overall good movie. The action is breathtaking\\, the effects are great\\, the film has a great sense of humor. The acting is good\\, there are some twists I didn't see coming and we get a deeper look into Kylo Ren's past. I didn't like how they handled Snoke and parts of the movie blatantly rip off Return of the Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back but I definitely enjoyed the film.","true":true}
