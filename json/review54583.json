Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best in the series. Fan boys tfa is to much like the original\\, tlj is to different from the original I hate them both! There is only a few parts that I didn't like but overall I loved it. I've read almost every book some of them twice. Seen the movies countless times and loved this one for its originality and direction.","true":true}
