Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Think star wars without character development\\, and add forced and out of place marvel movie one liner jokes\\, and long scenes that dont matter with too many CGI creatures to count and you have Last Jedi.","true":true}
