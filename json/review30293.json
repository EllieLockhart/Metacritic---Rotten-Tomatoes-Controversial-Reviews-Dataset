Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Scenery & effects are great\\, good rythm as well. However there is no plot at all in this episode. Same situation at the beginning and at the end of the movie\\, with many inconsistencies and serious holes. In terms of psychology complexity\\, the movie is made for 10 year old public. No creativity at all\\, this is very disappointing","true":true}
