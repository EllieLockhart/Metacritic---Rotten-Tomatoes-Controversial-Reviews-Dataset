Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the targeted backlash from a tremendously vocal minority that has come with the latest entry into the Star Wars universe\\, The Last Jedi is a clear sign that Disney and Lucasfilm don't intend to play it safe going forward. The movie subverts many fans expectations\\, which may explain the strong responses it's faced. However\\, Star Wars has always had those subversive moments; twists in a narrative that shock or unsettle us as a result of their \\\"out of left field\\\" nature.\\n\\nFrom the \\\"no\\, I am your father\\\" reveal of Empire Strikes Back\\, to the moment that Luke and Leia's sibling status is uncovered\\, the original trilogy was built on moments that redefined the relationships of characters we'd come to love and care about.\\n\\nThere are many weaving narratives being told in the film\\, and most of them are quite strong. It's understandable that many have reacted negatively to what's being called the \\\"Casino Plot\\\"\\, as it seems to least fit the overall pacing and feel of the movie. That said\\, to overlook the excellent interactions between Kylo Ren and Rey\\, the willingness of the writers to bring forward well beloved characters without simply parroting their previous arcs\\, and the daring to center the entire film around the heroes struggling would be foolish. This second chapter sets up an exciting path for what comes next.","true":true}
