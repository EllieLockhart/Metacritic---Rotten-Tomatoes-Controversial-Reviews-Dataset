Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched the movie with no spoilers or preconceived opinions on what the plot should be. I had zero issues with the first except the Leia on the bridge scene and the milk thing; those scenes were just weird. Plot wise again I had no issues whatsoever.\\nFor background\\, I have seen all the movies and TV shows but have read none of the books.","true":true}
