Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie - story was very weak and writing was terrible. I would not waste my money on this movie. Its sad what is happening to the Star Wars franchise. I never thought I would say this (ever) but the Star Trek movies are so much better.","true":true}
