Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was drawn in by Kelly Tran. She's beautiful and intelligent. Hope she \\ngets more screen time. True \\nCinderella story of the franchise.\\nPlus love the anime influence of Star \\nWars.   As far as the whole debate on the changes of this Saga. It's obvious \\nthat a lot of fans wanted a return to \\nthe original 3 of Luke\\, Leia and Han.  \\nBut for me it ended with Return. \\nThat was their story. This saga is a \\nsequel of the next generation being \\nhanded the new stories.  A tighter \\nscript with a happy ending will \\nprobably make more people happy.","true":true}
