Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, lets make this quick. This is a pretty disposable film; casual viewers will think they love it and they will defend it with \\\"clever\\\" arguments like \\\"Yall butthurt cuz u not got ur questions answere\\\" or \\\"Sorry fanboys.  A new Star Wars for a new generation. Get over it\\, haters!\\\" (Sadly\\, these are actual reviews from SJW here on Rotten Tomatoes) Disney will blame nonexistent bots as excuse for the bad reviews because they are in denial. The truth is the film is a joke\\, if you like movies with interesting characters\\, good storytelling and actual common sense\\, DON'T SEE IT. The film is a stab in the heart for people WHO REALLY CARES about the franchise. This thing may please people who like explosions\\, bad jokes\\, hollow politically correct characters\\, and stuff but is just as disposable as a condom. This is the last time I see Star Wars at the movie theater\\, Star Wars is dead now. Call me \\\"butthurt\\\" all as you want kid\\, but at least I appreciate quality entertainment and I'm not as easy to please as you.","true":true}
