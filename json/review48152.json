Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this film has one major cringeworthy moment involving Leia pulling a Peter Pan\\, and a scene in the middle of the movie that it a nod to PETA and pod-racing\\, I actually really enjoyed this film. Rian Johnson did everything we didn't see coming and it worked for me. One or two moments in this film may be the most powerful in the entire saga and John Williams score was at its absolute best!","true":true}
