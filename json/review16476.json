Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm surprised by all the negative comments this film has received. I loved it. Sure\\, I understand why some people were so disappointed by this film\\, but it was a fun\\, shocking film that was worth the watch. The Canto Bight scene was boring\\, but once it was past that\\, the film got back on track. It's not the best film in the franchise\\, but it's definitely up there.","true":true}
