Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A die hard fan of the franchise my expectations for this movie could not have been higher after The Force Awakens. However I was disappointed in this movie. Too much unnecessary scenes (Fin and Rose and codebreaker) and not enough Luke. Overall there was just a lot of unnecessary effort put towards characters who are uninteresting\\, making the movie drag along.","true":true}
