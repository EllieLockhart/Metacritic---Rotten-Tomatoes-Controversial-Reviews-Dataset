Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to Enjoy this new trilogy but this second film killed it for me. No matter how many times I watch it...it just adds more fuel to the flame. The Last Jedi wants to tell a political message over a great story. Rey still has no character development\\, Finn is very meh. Poe is side lines super hard. And a lot of key mysteries introduced in the first film are thrown out the window. With star wars releasing every year now...it's getting very stale. Plus Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy don't wanna listen\/nor make great movies for the fans\\, they want to the movies for themselves.","true":true}
