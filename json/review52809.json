Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of forced humor - 9 out of 10 of the jokes fell flat. Lots of shallow new characters. No growth for Snoke\\, Captain Phasma is an undefined footnote\\, Finn and Rose escaping on a BB-8 pioloted Walker feels like a cringe worthy moment from eps. 1-3\\, Laura Dern looking more like she belongs in the Hunger Games than Star Wars\\, and overall way too long and boring. What a mess. Probably not as bad as the prequels but easily the worst of 4-8.","true":true}
