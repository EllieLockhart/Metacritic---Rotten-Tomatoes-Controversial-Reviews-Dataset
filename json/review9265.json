Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage.\\n\\nRian Johnson just took a massive dump on everything TFA set up.\\n\\nThe movie is filled with SJW nonsense and overly political messaging.\\n\\nTHIS IS STAR WARS! You're not supposed to divide people with more politics.","true":true}
