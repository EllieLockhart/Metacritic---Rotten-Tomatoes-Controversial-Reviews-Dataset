Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I took my two sons to see this over the Christmas break and we almost walked out. I couldn't believe how stupid this movie was compaired to the other star wars movies. The last one called Rogue One was really good and my sons loved it. How could this one be so bad? Its like the directer was trying to make a bad movie. It didn't seem like a star wars movie. \\n\\nMaybe young kids would like this but my sons are 14 and 16. They hated it. Oh well I guess we still have super hero movies.","true":true}
