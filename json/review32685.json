Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most beautifully directed Star Wars Movie I have seen. Rian Johnson has made a movie that went far beyond my expectations. Totally different than what I expected. That\u2019s something to praise about.","true":true}
