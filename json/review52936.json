Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another Star Wars film for kids to enjoy. While it has its issues\\, and there are things that could have been done better\\, it has some great sequences\\, made even better by a truly amazing score.\\nThe film takes some chances while exploring the mysteries of the Force. \\nThough there is a sequence that seems to be impossible in both our world and the Star Wars universe\\, once examined\\, the science checks out\\, as well as the Force side of it. \\nThe final thirty minutes or so of the movie bring an epic battle\\, followed by an even more epic battle\\, with a final confrontation that focuses on letting the music and scenery do most of the storytelling.\\nOnce again\\, John Williams has created a score that illustrates the emotions of the film so well that caused some peoplemin the theatre to cry over the death of a character that had been introduced five minutes before.\\nThe sound mixing was done well\\, and a sequence where the sound cuts out\\, allowing you to hear the reactions of the other audience members\\, surprised everyone\\, and makes the film even better.\\nOverall\\, the scenery and music combined with some great action sequences are what make the movie worth watching.","true":true}
