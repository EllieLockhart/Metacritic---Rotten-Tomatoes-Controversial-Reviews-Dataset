Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so bad and such a let down that I literally signed up just to contribute to the movement of showing Disney\\, Kathleen\\, Johnson and all SJW's out there that true Star Wars fans will not accept this garbage. There will be mass boycotts for SOLO which has already had many leaks pointing to another disappointing film. Which will anger more fans and cause more boycotts and I can't wait to see the look on Kathleen's smug face when she realizes she alone destroyed the world's greatest franchise with SJW BS!!","true":true}
