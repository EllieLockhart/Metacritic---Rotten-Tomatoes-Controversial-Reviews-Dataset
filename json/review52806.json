Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of fans are angry at this movie\\, and with good reason\\, I think.  It makes some choices that go against preconceived notions of what a Star Wars movie should be\\, and for that I give Mr. Rian Johnson a huge salute for having to guts to do that.  Of course\\, making surprising choices isn't enough.  It just so happened that these choices are in perfect service to the story and the messages.\\n\\nOh\\, and it looks great.  So many shots in the third act were just breathtaking.","true":true}
