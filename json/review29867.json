Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One gave fans hope for the franchise but this movie was just trash Useless story lines \\, useless characters that no one cares about \\, no questions answered and Luke skywalker oh my god don\u2019t get me started there this was a complete waste of time . Disney finally killed Star Wars ","true":true}
