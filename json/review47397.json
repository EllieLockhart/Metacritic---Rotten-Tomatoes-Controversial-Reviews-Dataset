Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did I just see. Terrible movie. Deviates from force awaken way too much and okay visuals. Terrible story too ......did Leia just fly through space using the force? Even with CGI she looked like she was on a wire or Casper the ghost! One alright saber fight and the rest can be forgotten.","true":true}
