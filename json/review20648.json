Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen it twice now. On Thursday I walked out of the theater a bit disappointed based on the spoiler-free review hype I had read. Then I saw it again with my expectations put in check and thought it was one of the better Star Wars movies. I would recommend everyone to go see the movie a second time. Certain things could have been better and certain things could have been cut out of the movie entirely but I don't get the low audience score at all.  \\n\\nAlso enjoyed the movie a lot more when it wasn't in 3D.","true":true}
