Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Update on 22.05 - Changed from 0.5 star to 1 just to make it included in the overall score manipulated by Rotten Tomatoes (which proves RT is biased towards maniacal krazy kathleen kennedy and her sjw agenda).\\nThe movie is basically a pinnacle of Kathleen Kennedy's crusade towards pushing bigotrous agenda. The setup the Episode VII has been ignored giving Rian Johnson unlimited power as to commit a rape of Star Wars universe. If you enjoyed the Original Trilogy\\, respect\\, love and relate to its characters\\, stay away from this atrocity of a movie.The plot and character development are a lame jape and never have I seen so much identity politics shoved in cinematic experience just to pander to certain demographics in an attempt to maximize profits. I rejoice in seeing the agenda and approach introduced by the current Lucasfilm president fails. Doubling down or even tripplilng down on her agenda will lead Star Wars further towards 6 feet underground. I will neither acknowledge\\, nor forgive Kahleen Kennedy for calling shots as to killing off one the best Star Wars charcters (spolier alert\\, this character's name rhymes with Johnny Walker).\\n\\nAbsolutely disgracefull and self-righteous of current Lucasfilm leadership to stand for this film\\, not acknowledge obvious mistakes and ideological overtone they are so desperately trying to push.","true":true}
