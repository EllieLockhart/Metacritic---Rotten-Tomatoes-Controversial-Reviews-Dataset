Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely ruined the Star Wars universe\\, butchered the characters we know and love\\, and was just an all in all bad movie. \\n\\nThe new characters of this trilogy have absolutely no direction narratively speaking\\, and the old ones either do things that completely contradict their character's motivations in the original trilogy\\, or are just cast aside unceremoniously. Rian Johnson had no idea how to write these characters\\, and left this movie in shambles.\\nWho is Snoke? Why is the First Order so big? Leia has force powers? Luke is a pessimistic hermit? Everything about this movie sucks\\, except for the cinematography.","true":true}
