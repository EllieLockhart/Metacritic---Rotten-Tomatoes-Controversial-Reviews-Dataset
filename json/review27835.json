Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally I thought this was extremely well done.\\n\\nA lot of people are probably irritated and giving it bad reviews because they went in expecting certain things to exist. When those things didn't happen the way they wanted them to\\, they weren't happy.\\n\\nHere's the thing - it isn't YOUR film.\\nIt is the dreams and vision of the team that made it happen.\\n\\nI think they did a bang up job and deserve the gleaming review I am giving them.\\n\\nCharacter development?\\nCheck\\nStory progression?\\nCheck\\nGreat cinematic action and cinematography?\\nCheck\\n\\nIdeas from the original trilogy repeating but also changed?\\nCheck\\n\\nGoing into this movie expecting certain things to be a certain way is setting you up for frustration and disappointment.
