Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Static characters that overcome no real internal struggles. A weak plot with Swiss cheese. Unnecessary humor poorly executed. If you're checking your social justice check-boxes for the critics\\, I suppose that's another comment.  The film is void of quality writing and thoughtful consideration. It's two and a half hours long and trust me\\, it feels two and a half hours long.\\n\\nThe audience score reflects the real pulse of this film. The movie is rotten.","true":true}
