Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson deliberately pokes Star Wars' original fanbase in the eye by creating a film with a pathetic plot\\, lousy dialogue\\, and even intentional omission of traditional SW signature film-making elements. Clearly\\, Johnson's intent\\, as stated by multiple characters\\, was to burn everything down. Shame on you\\, Mr. Johnson. Shame on Iger\\, Kennedy\\, and Disney. Shame on all of you.","true":true}
