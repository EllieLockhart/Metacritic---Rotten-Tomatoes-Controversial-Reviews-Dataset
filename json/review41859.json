Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible. The scenes are cut together like a low budget TV show\\, several of them feel like selections from a corny gag reel\\, the ones that don't carry a similar undertone. The majority of the movie has one wondering why the footage wasn't cut in editing.\\n\\nTake the fortune of watching this when you can skip through\\, as the important events make up about 45 minutes of the film and the majority of that is in the last half hour.","true":true}
