Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie I've seen in a while. A FUCKING TOTAL SHAME ON DISNEY FOR THIS OFFENSIVE PIECE OF FUCKING GARBAGE. I am an artist\\, a movie lover and I can't believe they let this movie fly. Rogue One was so good\\, I really wanted to like this one. But I AM SO FUCKING MAD THIS MOVIE IS SUCH TRASH I was so sad after leaving the film and I saw it twice to try to give it a second chance. THERE ARE SO SO SO MANY REASONS WHY THIS IS THE WORST FUCKING THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED. From the insanely stupid dialog\\, to terrible acting\\, to COMPLETELY IDIODIC PLOT that literally ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING\\, nothing is believable in this film. I am a Star Wars lover\\, not a crazy SW nerd but I love the OG movies as ANY ONE DOES and also I don't give a shit that the story line didn't follow what PEOPLE THOUGHT it's just THIS MOVIE IS SO FUCKING BAD I'D RATHER DIE THAN WATCH IT EVER AGAIN. FUCK YOU DISNEY.","true":true}
