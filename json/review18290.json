Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was great\\, it was Star Wars but with some fresh and long needed changes. Less of a repeat of the last few films in the saga and more something new. I like to think of it as a changing of the the guard.\\n\\nPeople complained the last movie was to much of the same and now that they did something different they complain it is to different. I say be your own judge of the film. Don't come in to this one expecting to go a particular way\\, let the story guide you not public reviewed.\\n\\nAlthough not perfect\\, I truly felt this was a great film.","true":true}
