It is a wonderful game and without doubt would recommend this as a must play. Yes I did read some of the negative reviews and you should just ignore it. I took my time and spend almost 40 hours playing through the game. Also died a lot!\r\rThe story is intense and not always going where you want it to go. This is not a bad thing. I even caught myself yelling at Ellie for making a stupid decision. In the first game we already learned that Ellie is a strong independent girl\\, now she is a strong young women and so is most of the women you will meet on your journey. They grew up in this harsh and unforgiving world and killing is part of survival.\rPlaying different characters was an eye opener to me as it forced me to look at things from a different perspective. It was not always comfortable\\, but very necessary. Better story than most movies.\rWell done and thank you Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
