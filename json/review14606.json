Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was 10 and this is the first movie in the entire series that left me completely cold. The film is heartbreakingly bad\\, and features all of the director Rian Johnson's worst impulses. All of the jokes fell flat\\, none of the characters have any personality\\, and all the new additions to the mythology contribute nothing by way of what really matters - heart\\, emotion\\, character\\, story. This film felt like a poor stab at fan fiction. Crushing disappointment.","true":true}
