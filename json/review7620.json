Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything J.J. Abrams did to resurrect the feeling of the original trilogy with its storytelling\\, well-developed characters\\, emotional moments\\, and smart dialogue\\, is lost in this movie. Instead we have gimmicks\\, misplaced attempts at humor\\, and no depth of feeling in this movie. With this high of a rating from \\\"professional critics\\\"\\, it makes me wonder if people have given up on the hope of replicating the original.","true":true}
