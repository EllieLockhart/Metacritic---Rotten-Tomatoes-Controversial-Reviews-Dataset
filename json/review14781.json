Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen this film twice and I will likely purchase it when it becomes available in DVD. It's one of the best of the SW franchise\\, which has been a favorite of mine since the beginning.","true":true}
