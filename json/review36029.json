Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi sits right there with the OT for me as of now\\, but it can change when i have seen it a few more times. I have been thinking about this movie for 2 days straight\\, and I adore what they have done.","true":true}
