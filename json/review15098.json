Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this movie more giddy than I can remember ever being before. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I screamed\\, I slapped my friend more than strictly necessary. This movie was a massive undertaking and definitely had its flaws\\, but the overall product was a sensory masterpiece and managed to balance character personality and humor with deeper lessons. One of the best movies I've seen in a while\\, especially since I don't expect cinematic perfection from scifi\/fantasy movies.","true":true}
