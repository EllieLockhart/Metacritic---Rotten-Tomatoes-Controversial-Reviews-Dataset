Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was awesome. I would watch it again. Great acting\\, great special affects and great Director. You can't go wrong with JJ Abrams directing. The CGI was great\\, if it's going to look fake\\, don't use it. But they did great here.","true":true}
