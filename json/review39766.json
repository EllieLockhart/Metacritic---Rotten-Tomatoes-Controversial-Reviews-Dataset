Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a movie for folks who want a smart\\, emotional\\, original Star Wars film. \\n\\nThose who are fine with Hollywood's many Transformer Pirates of the Carribean quality movies\\, and who want more of the same regurgitated drivel\\, are disappointed. And that's fine with me. I don't want a movie that appeals to you anyway.\\n\\nI can't wait to see it again. Fantastic movie.","true":true}
