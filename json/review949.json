Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An interesting development in the Star Wars Saga.  A long movie of which I have no problems\\, however the Casino sequence was unnecessary except for developing the Finn and Rosie characters.  The fight and battle scenes were excellent especially the Ben\/Rey\/Snoke scene.  I like the direction and where the trilogy is going. it's good to see the departure of Luke and hopefully soon Leia will follow. These characters need to carry story line on their own and look forward to see how it develops.","true":true}
