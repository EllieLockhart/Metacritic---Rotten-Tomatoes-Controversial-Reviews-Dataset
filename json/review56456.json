Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Disney Disaster Star Wars Strike again\\, \\nThis movie is an utterly ridiculous movie to sit through\\, \\nFrom uncomfortable scenes that try desperately to make audiences laugh but fail to boring story telling through Finn adventure to poes\\, Mark hamill does well for what is giving to him but it's a failed attempt by Disney to write the character as perfect as he was in the original trilogy\\, Disney want these new films to live upto the success of the original trilogy but The Disney stars wars films make the prequels look like masterpieces\\, C3PO once again is pointless even upto the new owls from Luke island is utterly cringe to watch but is just there to sell toys like the other cute animals in this train wreck of a film\\, \\nIt is heart breaking to know this was Carrie Fisher final film what a sad way to go out in a distasteful film like this\\, \\nA teenager could of wrote a better story than this just to think this story came from a professional payed adult just gives me great disappointment for how far the Disney disaster Films have fallen. \\nR.i.p to Carrie Fisher and star wars may they rest in peace.","true":true}
