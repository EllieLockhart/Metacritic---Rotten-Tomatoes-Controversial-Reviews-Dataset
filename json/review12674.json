Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't get into the movie. From the very first scenes\\, seeing General Hux\\, who supposedly is the leader of the first order act as a three years old took me out and I couldn't get back in. For me Star Wars is first and foremost a cohesive universe\\, and this movie just threw it out the window.","true":true}
