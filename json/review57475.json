Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible \\, we all better pray Kathleen Kennedy gets fired for letting this abomination of star wars hit the theaters. They didn't even have Luke use a lightsaber in a real fight when fans have been waiting years to see hamil since Disney purchased SW from Lucas. Seriously \\, people need to be FIRED over this.  I'm not even sure what to look forward to for episode 9 because ryan johnson took what story was started in the force awakens and hacked it up. Seriously what is the story now in Starwars? FFS story is the most important thing and i really have no idea what the point of star wars is right now.","true":true}
