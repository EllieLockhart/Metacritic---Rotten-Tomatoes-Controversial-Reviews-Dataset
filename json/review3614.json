Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie to date\\, fanboys get over yourselves and enjoy the movie for what it is. It was a great movie that had my jaw on the floor and very unexpected moments. Still borrowed heavily from ESB and ROTJ but it paves the way for something entirely new. The original trilogy was not without its flaws and people need to put their expectations and wants for this film away\\, bc it\u2019s wrong to hate something that just because it was the film you expected it to be.
