Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do believe that RJ is a brilliant filmmaker and director\\, he is just not a good storyteller.  He was given a huge task\\, to both write and direct a 200 million dollar movie.  He would have benefited from having a co-writer to help him.  He has no one to help him out with plotholes and bad ideas\\, there were just too many awful scenes to mention here\\, they have been covered by others very well.\\n\\nA beautifully made movie without any real story\\, watching this movie was a like going on a date with a beautiful person\\, who has no personality and tells you nothing about herself\/himself. Lots of style without substance.  This was the first time I fell asleep during a Star Wars movie\\, and the first time I have only seen a Star Wars movie once in the theater.","true":true}
