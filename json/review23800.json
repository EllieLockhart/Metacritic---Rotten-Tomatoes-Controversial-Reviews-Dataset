Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was a different character all together. The kamikaze scene was beautiful but Admiral Holdo was unnecessarily keeping secret plans from Poe. Rey was again too powerful beyond reason. Snoke was wasted. Rose was a blatant forced diversity. Nobody cares about diversity in movies as long as they make sense and feel natural. No hate on the actors. I'm rooting for Kylo Ren to be even more prominent in the next one.","true":true}
