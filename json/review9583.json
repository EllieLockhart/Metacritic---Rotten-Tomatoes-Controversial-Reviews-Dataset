Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good looking movie. Had a lot of action. However it ended a lot of interesting plots with main characters and I feel that the story didn't hold together at all.","true":true}
