Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I love how the critics\\, paid by the business give it a 93% and the people who had to endure this whiny\\, boring effort of a movie give it a 56%. People this movie has about 15 minutes of good in it. The rest is entirely missable. Does anyone remember 1977\\, the first Star Wars? I saw it with my father\\, it was such an excellent movie. 40 years later\\, I took my two girls to this one...and I feel we wasted two hours","true":true}
