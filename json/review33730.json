Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Many useless\\, boring subplots that don't develop characters or the universe. Lacks the guts and gravitas of Episode VII.  Does not deserve to be part of the Star Wars cannon. I would say that Episode I was at least entertaining\\, this one is just boring. Spoiler warning: it ends characters that everyone likes and loves without any respect\\, unlike Episode VII.","true":true}
