Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was probably the last Starwars film that I will go watch... ever since the new Disney political adaptations came out I would leave each cinema feeling... less entertained\\, let down and kinda drained. I guess this was the tipping point for me.  I realised that I am no longer passionate about the franchise and frankly no longer a Starwars fan. :'(","true":true}
