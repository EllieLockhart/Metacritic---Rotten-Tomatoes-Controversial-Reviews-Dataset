Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sad waste of so much good material. Plot holes everywhere. Unbelievable inconstant characters. Completely stupid pointless subplots that made the movie too long\\, riddled with a bunch of not so subtle hitting of the audience on the head with a moral broom on topics like slavery and animal cruelty. The director consistently mocks the audience by repeatedly pointing out that what you thought would happen won't\\, your hopes and expectations are meaningless\\, and everything the story set up in the past doesn't matter. In essence\\, everything is pointless\\, everything is wishy woshy and flippy floppy\\, and nothing matters.\\n\\nWhat a mess.","true":true}
