Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a longstanding Star Wars fan\\, I wanted to love this movie\\, but I didn't. It was as if everything J.J. Abrams set up in TFA was callously dismissed by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Taking the franchise in a different direction wouldn't have necessarily been a bad decision on its own\\, but the storyline in this 2 1\/2 hour boondoggle was full off plot holes\\, preachy PC messages\\, and one disappointing turn after another. I liked Brick and Looper\\, so I was excited to see what Johnson brought to the franchise. Again\\, I wasn't against taking the new trilogy in a different direction\\, but this was poorly executed and not really fun at all. I wasn't a fan.","true":true}
