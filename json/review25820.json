Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOTE: I just learned that This site does not count 1\/2 ratings. what a dishonest site. I will keep that in mind from now on. also i'm sorry if this is all caps for some reason rotten tomatoes won't let me uncaps my message. with that said here is my original comment back in 2017. i have learned my lessen now\\, rotten tomatoes is not an accurate site for movie reviews. Horrendous movie. This is my first time rating any movie on this site. I felt like I had too due to the massive rating difference between actually users and the \\\"critics\\\" Like seriously? 90% vs 49%","true":true}
