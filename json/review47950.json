Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it has a few moments I liked\\, the poor use of characters and really disappointing plot made this movie probably my least favorite of all the Star Wars movies. The connection between Rey and Kylo up to and including the scenes in the throne room make this movie bearable to re-watch\\, but that's about it. Bad choices for and surrounding Poe\\, Finn\\, and Luke's characters killed this movie for me.","true":true}
