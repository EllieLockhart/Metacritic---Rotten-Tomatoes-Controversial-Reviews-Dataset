Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead. I can't believe how incompetent was the scrip. The casino story line is pure thrush! The characters are blend\\, the jokes are completely out of line and the story as a hole doesn't make any sense. From my part I'm done with star wars and this one was the worst of the entire saga!","true":true}
