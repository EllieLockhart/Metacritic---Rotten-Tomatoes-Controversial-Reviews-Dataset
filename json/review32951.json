Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story is a mess\\, major conflicts in the movie could have been resolved by simple conversations. Not only was there to much comedy\\, it was bad comedy. Many pointless sub plots and characters. The awfulness of this movie far out ways the few good parts. Overall this movie is a mess\\, but at least Disney will sell a lot of Porg toys.","true":true}
