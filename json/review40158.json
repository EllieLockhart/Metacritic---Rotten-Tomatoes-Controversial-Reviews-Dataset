Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not only a bad Star Wars movie\\, but a bad movie\\, period. Full of gaping plot holes and tedious stretches. No character development\\, entirely ignoring almost every interesting character mystery set up in Ep. VII. If this is the future of the franchise\\, I'm out (very sadly and unwillingly).","true":true}
