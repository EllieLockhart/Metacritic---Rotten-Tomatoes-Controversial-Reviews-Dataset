Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is how movies should be made. I could write a whole book about how much I loved it. The way the characters were written (So many awesome women - love it)\\, the acting the cinematography\\, and all those meta-levels hidden in those 152 minutes that I haven't even found out yet make me want to watch this movie over and over again. Thank you Rian Johnson!","true":true}
