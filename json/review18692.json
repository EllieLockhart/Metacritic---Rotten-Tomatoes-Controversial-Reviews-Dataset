Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I truly do not understand how the Critics can be so positive about such a flawed Star Wars Movie. This movie is just plain terrible. All the male roles have been turned into paper puppets and the females are all but the greatest of the great with a do no wrong attitude. And the cheap one liners are so bad they make you literally cringe. If you want to make a good movie then have gender equality. Katleen Kenedy is single handily ruing a once great franchise with her agenda.","true":true}
