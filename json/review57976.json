Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"when I went in to see this film opening night I was excited to see Luke Skywalker return\\, I was ready to see space battles and lightsaber fights\\, I was ready to see a good movie. What I got was a MASSIVE disappointment the story was all over the place\\, Rey was a Mary Sue\\, the casino planet was unnecessary to the plot\\, Luke Skywalker dying enraged me\\, and the fact that the purple haired leader couldn't tell Po the plan because he was a hot shot is the worst reason I have ever heard of. The First Order's military leaders who are supposed to be a representation of the Nazi's who fled to South American and regrouped don't have any competent leaders in their ranks. Whats worse the comedy derails the plot on several occasions and hurts the serious tone that the movie is going for. Now a few subtle jokes from C3P0 and Chewbacca would have been fine but to have as many \\\"jokes\\\" that the movie did I thought I was trying to be a bad sequel to Space Balls. Also as this was the final film with Carrie Fisher I felt as though it would have been better if Leia died in the attack on the main bridge of the ship. It would have been a huge emotional blow to the audience and it would have had an impact on the characters in the movie\\, instead they pulled a Mary Poppins out of no where showing she has force powers that are equal to that of Luke despite the fact she never had any official force training\\, this turns an emotional death scene that would have surpassed the death of Han Solo and it would show that this movie had balls. Instead the film decided that \\\"Nope we are going to keep her alive for no reason other than the fact that we want her to live and kill Luke off because we want him t die.\\\" I am disappointed with Disney and I am disappointed with Cathleen Kennedy as they should have written a better script and take a page out of the two previous trilogies for how to write a proper script.This movie is on the same level as a bad fanfiction. \\n-10\/10 will not buy the DVD or Blu-Ray\\, do not recommend anyone to see.","true":true}
