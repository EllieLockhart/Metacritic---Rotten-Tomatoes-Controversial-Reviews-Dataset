Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought that this was a fantastic departure from your standard Star Wars fare. The twists within the movie were done brilliantly\\, culminating in a story that essentially gives the entire universe a clean slate to move forward.\\n\\nWhile I think that the casino planet story line could have been tightened a bit\\, I think the addition of Rose to the group is a strong one.\\n\\nI can also see where Mark Hamill came from with his disagreement of the character direction. With that in mind I think that his performance is just brilliant\\, and the ending of this phase of Luke's story is exceptionally handled.","true":true}
