Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The disappointment is almost too much to bear. 40 years of watching the greatest Saga and hero of all times and it was all erased in 2 1\/2 hours. Idk what the slap stick comedy was about. I think Mel Brooks did that version once upon a time. Luke deserved better. He deserved a better send off\\, or better yet to be kept around to lead and train a new Jedi order. Rey deserved the knowledge and training from a Jedi master as Luke and Anakin received. All the other films have the same feel to them when you watch. This one feels like it's not even a Star Wars movie. Rey deserves a back story. She deserves better than to be told she's just an afterthought tossed away as a small child like a piece of garbage. What the heck happened in editing and post production? Wasn't anymore paying attention? My only wish since every beloved character is dead now\\, is that I could unsee this film and go back to enjoying the previous 8 including Rogue One. People ask how I feel about the film. All I can say is stunned. ","true":true}
