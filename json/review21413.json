Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish that I could have put a zero.  This is a terrible film\\, They throw away every setup that was given to them from the force awakens. Side plots are irrelevant and off putting. At first I thought that Rian Johnson was just a talentless hack\\, but now I actually think that he did this on purpose.  He wanted to destroy everyone's expectations for some reason.  This is such a slap in the face to Star Wars that I really wish that Disney would just come out and just pull the film and basically retract it from history\\, deny all involvement\\, hire a new director\\, and just make a completely new film and we could all just pretend like this didn't happen. I'll go along with the facade Disney. Let's do this\\, I'm with you","true":true}
