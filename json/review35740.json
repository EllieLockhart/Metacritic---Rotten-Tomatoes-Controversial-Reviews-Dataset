Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is by far the best of the Star Wars Movies to come out in the last 30 years. The cast is amazing\\, the set pieces and visual effects are breathtaking. Mark Hamill's portrayal of Luke was spot on\\, and his story arc helped give the movie life. The emotional plot was perfect\\, and the many twists were created unexpected suspense. Best Star Wars movie ever made!!!!","true":true}
