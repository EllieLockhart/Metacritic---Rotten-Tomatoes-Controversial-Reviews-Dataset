Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This director had a way different focus than the previous.  Suggestion- one director for all three.  Film had no cohesion and film had no proper character interaction - poor script.  Superman Leia and Casino scenes were not needed .  The villians were not villians but comedic fill -ins.  I could go on and on......is this franchise ruined\\,  Jj Abrams has a lot of work in 9 to turn it around.","true":true}
