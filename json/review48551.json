Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"words can't describe how disappointing this movie was. awful plot\\, cringe worthy acting\\, too many people trying to have that han solo one-liner\\, just bad overall. and\\, because it drives me insane\\, they stuck a temporary tattoo on adam drivers face and said 'good enough'.\\n\\nas a sci-fi action movie\\, it's \/okay\/. as a star wars movie? it's a joke. the force awakens had promise\\, and rian johnson flushed it down the toilet.","true":true}
