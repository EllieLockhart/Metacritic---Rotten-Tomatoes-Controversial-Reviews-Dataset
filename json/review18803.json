Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's almost impossible to know where to begin critiquing this film. The franchise has been decimated. You can say what you will about the prequels falling victim to cheesey dialogue and casting missteps\\, but they pale in comparison to 2.5 hours of boring\\, disposable characters giving rousing pep talks about the cause.  And when I say disposable\\, it is just that:  Phasma was a tulpa. She fought like a clumsy football player\\, lowered the defenses of Starkiller Base WITHOUT RESISTANCE\\, and died as quickly as she appeared.  Almost as useless as Rose\\, who desperately tried to get the audience to care about her backstory throughout the film\\, while she leads a bumbling\\, panic freak (FINN) into and out of trouble on a boring side-mission that took away precious opportunities to watch Luke actually train Rey. \\n\\nLuke promises Rey three lessons\\, and delivers two half-assed lessons instead. No Lightsaber duel; just a stick fight between Luke and Rey...and Rey wins.  \\n\\nNever ONCE in a trilogy that was supposed to resolve the story arcs of our favorite heros did we even get Han\\, Leia\\, Luke\\, and Chewy in the same damn room!  Now the actors who are alive have dead characters\\, and the character left alive belongs to a dead actress.   This is the tip of the tip of the iceberg\\, I enjoyed some things\\, and I remained curious about what was coming next until the end credits popped up. It was then that i realized it was just so awful a film.\\n\\nLuke drinking seacow breast milk. Leia in space. The sorority that now runs everything. Half of the fighter pilots were women. The command ships were run almost exclusively by women. Male characters were painted as impulsive oafs\\, or in constant need of saving (FINN). They should have let FINN sacrifice himself at the end instead of having dumb Rose attempt to save him by most assuredly killing both of them in the process anyhow.\\n\\nSNOKE?!  What the FUCK is going on? Then Rey and Kylo team up to fight off first order guards who aren't force-users. Why weren't they throwing these guys around?  I can go on for hours.\\n\\nLuke refused to fight vader because he felt the conflict in him...yet he senses a conflict in his own nephew and decides to murder him IN HIS SLEEP?\\n\\nThrowing the lightsaber away without wondering where the fuck Rey got it from?\\n\\nWe didn't even get a flashback to the battle that The Knights of Ren fought at the jedi Academy?  Nothing? The Knights of Ren were explained in a quick line about Kylo grabbing a handful of students and running amok?\\n\\nLESS USELESS AGENDA-DRIVEN \\\"ROSE\\\" AND MORE LUKE.  But fuck that now\\, because Luke gave himself a Force Heart Attack and died.\\n\\nawful\\n\\nWhat the hell does JJ Abrams have to build on for episode IX?","true":true}
