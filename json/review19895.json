Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was different and that's a good thing. 7 was pure nostalgia and 8 is a new beginning. 9 is going to be amazing. I love how they added hints of every episode in this. Shows you they did their homework. Great movie! ","true":true}
