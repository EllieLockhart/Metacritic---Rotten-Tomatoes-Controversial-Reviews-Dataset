The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"During my first playthrough of this game I was finding it a little difficult to keep going\\, not because of the story choices\\, but because I just wanted resolution of some sorts and through all the character building it took longer than expected to get there. All the combat scenarios just felt like a delay on me getting to the end of the narrative that I was so invested in discovering. Now that I've had time to process and sleep on the game a bit (which it appears like some of you review bombing should have done)\\, this game executes what it wants to. It's a much darker game of hatred and spite\\, full of revenge and how it's and endless cycle... until someone breaks it. If Ellie kills Abby at the end\\, Lev would just hunt down Ellie\\, JJ would hunt down Lev and on and on it goes. Abby and Ellie were both good people corrupted by hatred\\, a poison that has no true antidote. It's heartbreaking to see the spiral that ensues with a character that we loved but I also felt it was realistic given that Ellie needed her life to have a meaning. Joel selfishly saved her so he didnt have to live with letting down a second daughter\\, and took Ellie's chance at providing meaning in the world from her\\, leaving her with so much survivor guilt. Once Joel died\\, Ellie's existence meant even less as the one person that doomed humanity to love her\\, was gone. Her life had even less meaning than before (to her). Therefore this revenge tale is not only seaking revenge on Joel's killers\\, but her hunt to find meaning through justice.\r\rThe gameplay itself is naughty dogs best yet by far\\, and it definitely leans into it's survival horror aspect more than the first game. No that I've gotten through the story\\, I am excited to go back and try different tactics and find all the collectibles and platinum this game. Whether you love or dont love the story that was told\\, this game's narrative has changed how story telling in games will be from now on\\, much like the last one did.\r\rTo all of the review bombers out there\\, either you are an xbox fanboy (honestly just make the switch ...I did)\\, or you had actually gripes with the narrative\\, which is fair! However whats not fair is giving this game anything below a 8\\, based on it's technical prowess and powerful story (like it or not). It's not a tale of love like the first game\\, but one that is powerful in it's own way\\, and I think the more people let the story settle with them\\, the better and better it will become.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
