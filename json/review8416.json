Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with plot holes\\, loose ends\\, uninspiring characters and a story that for the most part doesn't make sense. The Last Jedi gets parts of the atmosphere and scoring right\\, but mostly by copying previous movies in the saga. It has no really relatable characters\\, as they are all one-dimensional and without character arcs\\, and none of them are iconic in the way previous Star Wars movies have been. The attempts to create iconic and noteworthy images mostly come through alien species\\, but they just seem cheesy. Furthermore\\, the movie is filled with unnecessary political messaging that merely becomes about virtue signaling without affecting the plot at all. I will not see the upcoming movies in a theater\\, and will instead wait until I can get it on VOD.","true":true}
