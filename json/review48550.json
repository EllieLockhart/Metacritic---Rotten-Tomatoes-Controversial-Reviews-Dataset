Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Words can not express how bad this movie is.  I want my money back plus some for the mental anguish.  Fuck off Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson and anyone else that had a hand in this piece of shit.","true":true}
