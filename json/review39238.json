Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film fails to deliver on the expectations set by \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\" It appears that the plot twists were written specifically against what was expected so Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy could say that the film took risks.  That would be fine\\, if those surprises were satisfying to faithful Star Wars fans\\, but they aren't.  Additionally\\, the movie is overly long and clunky\\, with entire plot threads existing solely to give characters screen time for little impact.  The acting and cinematography are top notch.  Unfortunately\\, the effort is wasted on a film that fans will either mostly forget by the time the final movie releases\\, or vividly memorable for all the wrong reasons","true":true}
