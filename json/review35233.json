Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good: cinematography\\, acting\\, humor\\, character development\\, action scenes\\, emotional impact\\, visuals\\, special effects\\, new characters The bad: the plot\\, the arc\\, heavy handed messaging\\, story pivots\\, absent back story Where it sits relative to the rest (best to worst) - 5\\, 4\\, Rogue One\\, 8\\, 7\\, 6\\, 1\\, 2\\, 3 Greatest moments - destruction of the various capital ships (due to surrounding emotional build ups)\\, Kylo\\, Ray and Snoke (before and after)\\, best addition - the Rose character\\, too bad her sister isn\u2019t there too Worst moments - kid with the rebel ring\\, your parents were nobodies\\, Snoke who?\\, now lets get this rebellion started...?\\, del Toro reminding us that everything is pointless because the war never ends and the only way to stay free is stay out (was he talking about the war or Disney\u2019s plans for the franchise)?","true":true}
