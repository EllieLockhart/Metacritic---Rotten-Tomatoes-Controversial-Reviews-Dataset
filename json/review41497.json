Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is awful. It intentionally sets out to destroy Star Wars lore and characters. It even says so right in your face\\, breaking the fourth wall (it's good at that). This is an awful Star Wars movie\\, and an objectively bad film overall in terms of character\\, theme\\, editing etc. \\n\\nAs a Star Wars fan\\, this was depressing. As a non fan\\, someone who just wants to kill 2 hours\\, you might find it tolerable if you don't think about it at all.","true":true}
