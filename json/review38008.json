Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The start was good\\, the middle fell flat\\, the end was fantastic. \\nOne of the things I hated in this film was the huge disappointment of Snoke. Everyone was making theories on who he is\\, but in the end he ended up being just an ordinary guy. \\n\\nI can say i never need to hear the word \\\"Spunk\\\" in a star wars movie\\n\\nThere were a total of 2 moments that made me say wow\\n\\nOverall Rating: 8.2\/10","true":true}
