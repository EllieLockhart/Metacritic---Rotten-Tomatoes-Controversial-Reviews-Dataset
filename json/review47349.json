Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a way to end with the saga. How poorly they treated the previous story and charachters. I really hated this movie specially story wise\\, they left nothing interesting for the next episode. So long Star Wars.","true":true}
