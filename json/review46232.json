{"101487":193249,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning spoilers... Definitely does not deserve an audience score in the 50s. What a total exaggeration. This is an awesome Star Wars movie that did some new things regarding the mythos that I thought was super cool\\, warranted\\, and interesting. Many of the characters had pretty substantial or at the very least gratifying character arcs. To keep this simple. There were three main plots; the ship chase\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke\\, and then Finn and Rose. The best of these plots was the plot involving Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke. The worst of the plots was Finn's side mission\\, though it did have a few satisfying points of merit. I am happy this movie took risks and did things we haven't seen in the Star Wars universe before. The Force Awakens was a great movie\\, but it played it very safe mirroring many themes and plot devices we've already seen in the original trilogy. This movie has some similar themes\\, of course\\, but for me the strength of this movie is what it dares to do different. It's also the reason it's being met with so much criticism... I like that Luke was a jaded recluse living in isolation and shut off to the force. I like that we saw his daily life and routine. I like the light Saber toss when he Rey first approaches him because it shows where he is as a character. He is basically disgusted by it all\\, as we learn\\, he's done with the force. We learn that this has a lot to do with his failure in training Ben and steering him from the dark side. The last thing he wants is his save back\\, when he escaped to that island to live out his days and die. I'm also fine with him ascending into the force at the end\\, as trilogy is not about him\\, it doesn't revolve around him. It's about Rey\\, and Luke served his purpose in this movie while showing us some new cool force techniques. I'm fine Leia using the force to save herself when she was at the brink of death. I think it was a good choice not to have her die out in space out of respect for her character and for Carrie Fisher. I also thought it was cool be Leia has always been force sensitive\\, and has always been able to sense Luke. She didn't just become a jedi or something either\\, she's not suddenly going to be using the force all over. It was more an act of self preservation that I think took over her in a time of desperation. It doesn't appear that she even knew what was happening or how she did it. I like that Kylo kills Snoke just to not turn good\\, but to reaffirm that he is evil\\, and he is now in charge. I'm glad that they didn't make him subservient to Snoke like Vader was for as long as Vader was. I didn't want a repeat of the past Star Wars movies. So this was a surprising and satisfying move. It was also cool to see Kylo and Rey fight along side each other just to realize that there's no way they want the same things and that they are still very much enemies. Finn's story was the weakest as I said. It felt like they didn't entirely know what to do with his character while he was without Rey. I liked the concept of the code breaker\\, as it's cool to see someone pulling off stealthy things in this universe like breaching shields undetected. I'm glad that their plan ultimately fails though\\, as this doesn't happen much in movies\\, let alone Star Wars. In conclusion I like that this movie was daring and did things that we haven't seen before in the star wars movies. I really enjoyed most of the character arcs. I also enjoyed the expansion of the Star Wars mythos with the unique things they did with the force in this movie. It felt really compelling. Though it wasn't perfect\\, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. ","true":true}
