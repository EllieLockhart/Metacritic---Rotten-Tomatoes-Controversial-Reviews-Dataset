If all you talk about in trailers and interviews is the story\\, then that's what I'm going to focus on. Good graphics are easy to do nowadays\\, gameplay is just copy-paste of a 7 year old game with mindless new additions that don't take away the repetitive aspect of it. It's a mess\\, a waste of money\\, and honestly\\, a disgrace to the series\\, which seems to have died already at the second game.\r\rMaybe the company shouldn't have fired the people that actually made good games like Amy Hennig or Bruce Straley. I think little druck is probably angry knowing he'll never reach the talent or creativity of those two.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
