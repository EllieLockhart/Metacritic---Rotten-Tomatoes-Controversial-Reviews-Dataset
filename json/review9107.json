Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of twists\\, breath-taking moments\\, great action sequences and references\\, The Last Jedi manages to set the franchise in a bold new direction\\, while also respecting the past. The movie has its handful of flaws\\, such as excessive humour\\, small pacing issues and a subplot that is thematically interesting\\, but ultimately becomes the movie's weak point both narratively and dramatically. In spite of those flaws\\, the main characters and their relationships are well developed. The acting is also extremelly competent\\, with Mark Hamill standing out with the best performance of his career. A few moments may feel awkward for hardcore Star Wars fans (especially a scene with Leia)\\, but I would not dare to say that they are \\\"mistakes\\\". Rian Johnson manages to write a good script (not that good in that subplot I mentioned)\\, and delivers outstanding cinematography. However\\, some fans may not approve of Johnson's vision\\, since it is bold and original\\, which means that audiences expecting \\\"fan-fiction\\\" will be disappointed. In conclusion\\, The Last Jedi feels like a Star Wars movie while also innovating\\, breaking expectations\\, and delivering solid characters in a gorgeously looking movie.","true":true}
