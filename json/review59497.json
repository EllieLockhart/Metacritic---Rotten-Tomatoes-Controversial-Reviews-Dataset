Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"They had 7 years to write and figure out AT LEAST a DECENT send off to one of the game's most loved characters and protagonists. Heck\\, they had 7 years to come up with anything they wanted. Instead\\, they gave us this trashpile of a storyline where Joel dies like an incompetent boy-scout on his first day out basically shutting his brain off and not acting like we know he would by breaking his own rules. Then\\, we have to play for what it felt like an eternity with MA'AM (whom we could care less about tbh) and go through a lot of unnecessary things that are forgettable at best. When we FINALLY get to the end\\, you give us some stupid excuse for why Ellie doesn\u00b4t complete her revenge journey. WHAT IS THIS?! These characters are making the stupidest and most non-sensical decisions ever! They're not acting in the way they would if someone competent had written the story!\r\rThe only reason this is getting 4 of 10 is because the game actually runs (despite some glitches every now and then) and the graphics and sound and what not.\r\rWe were better off without this sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
