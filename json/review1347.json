Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Arguably the best of the franchise. The story was the smoothest\\, had tons of humor to keep us interested in a seemingly hopeless journey\\, and one of the biggest shocks in cinema history\\, yes the kylo ren vs rey scene.\\n\\nIt was full of twists and turns and you never quite knew what was going to happen. Yes luke milked a thing\\, yes there was a fairly predictable death. Get over yourselves.\\n\\nIt was the smoothest\\, funnest installment to the franchise. Who was the editing team behind this? They need a medal!","true":true}
