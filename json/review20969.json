Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hoping for a lot from this\\, and expected Disney to deliver\\, but I must say that this is the worst Star Wars film ever. To me\\, it just doesn't track with the originals - it's not Star Wars.","true":true}
