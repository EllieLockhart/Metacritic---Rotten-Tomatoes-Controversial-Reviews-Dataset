Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointing:(\\n\\nAs much as I love Star Wars this has to be one of the most disappointing\\,poorly written and generic film in the Star Wars franchise. Many of the unanswered things we had in tfa was overshadowed in this film and for me my biggest problem with this film was the snoke part. He was presented as a really powerful supreme leader but was killed by Kylo ren in an anticlimactic way\\, without answering us the question of who he was\\, where he came from and his motivation.\\n\\nAlthough this film has many flaws it also has many great elements in it the acting is top notch by everyone\\,has beautiful visual effects\\, CGI and action scenes","true":true}
