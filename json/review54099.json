Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how this movie got such good reviews from critics\\, then again\\, I don't know how TFA did either. I don't think either were that good\\, they just had different ways of going about it. This movie completely disregarded many of the set ups and mysteries from the previous film as well as there being several inconsistencies. The stories that were disregarded and or had inconsistencies included: Han\\, Leia\\, Kylo Ren and their backstory\\, the Knights of Ren\\, Luke's Jedi Academy\\, Snoke\\, Rey's parentage\\, and the circumstances of her being left on Jakku. Finn\\, Rose\\, and Poe's stories had no effect on the plot whatsoever in the end and could have been cut without making a difference to the overall film\\, that's not good storytelling. Much of Finn's \\\"character development\/discovery\\\" part of his story was just a repeat of his TFA story. The three of them deserved better stories and I feel they were sidelined to an extent. A very fundamental piece of who Luke was as a person was changed\\, and to an extent I could try to rationalize it\\, but it still didn't sit right with me. I don't know what is the deal with Kylo Ren and Rey\\, but that parentage \\\"reveal\\\" was terrible and unsatisfying for everyone if that was it for the mystery. They have ruined Han\\, Luke\\, and Leia's characters\\, arcs and legacies from the originals in these 2 movies and I don't care for it at all\\, but Disney seems more concerned with pumping out constant movies\\, books\\, and merchandise than actually telling a good\\, in character story that respects history.","true":true}
