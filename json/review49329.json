Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie to date! Horridly inconsistent to the original trilogy\\, the Force Awakens\\, and even itself. Examples include Holdo major act when compared to Fins as a metaphor\\, and Rey\u2019s feelings about Kylo while Luke maintains his position. The movie is also filled with cheap gotcha moments designed purely to be different for the sake of doing so. The SJW stuff is out of control and is irrelevant to a galaxy far..far..away anyway. There aren\u2019t many aliens with active roles in the movie\\, something the originals\/ prequels did to help envelope you in the strange and alien universe which Star Wars is based in. Many characters who had significant plot points and seemingly important roles in TFA disappear or become muted. All in all it\u2019s the most wildly inconsistent film with respect to the Star Wars cannon. It looks good\\, it sounds good\\, but it has no soul.","true":true}
