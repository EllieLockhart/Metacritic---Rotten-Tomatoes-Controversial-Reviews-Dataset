Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I'm very disappointed with this movie. Luke was completely out of character. I like Finn\\, but his scenes with Rose were a complete waste of time and boring. Rose seems like a character that was just shoehorned in and wasted screen time. They made phasma useless. Leia had a very ridiculous scene I don't want to spoil. Movie felt way too marvelish","true":true}
