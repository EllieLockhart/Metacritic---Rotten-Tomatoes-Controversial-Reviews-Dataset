Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed with this garbage they tried pass off as a well thought out and fan-wanted film.  I have never left a theater after seeing a Star Wars movie feeling robbed until The Last Jedi. It could have been such a great installment of the Skywalker family story but they wasted their opportunity. Yes\\, parts were great\\, but as a whole there were just too many fumbles to forgive. What will Johnson do with this new trilogy that awaits? I know for me that my excitement and expectations could hardly be any lower.  Thanks so much Disney.  Well played.","true":true}
