But overall a good looking game.\r-Gameplay....is there really something to say about this? Same old boring copypaste of the first one with some minor changes. The infamous jump button\\, some guitar sections.\rI've seen many people online and videos on YouTube talk and show how the game is a BROKEN piece of trash. So many glitches and bugs.\r-Story....the worst part of the whole game. We waited 7 years for this. Boring characters\\, boring old rEvEnGE story which we've  TOTALLY NEVER seen before in a movie or videogame. Not just that but it executes it badly. The whole point is that revenge is bad\\, Abby gets her revenge and is awarded for it but Ellie goes through living hell and is punished for seeking her revenge. You literally cannot emotionally connect with the characters\\, and the way they try to make you to feel bad about your actions is so bad but not only that but they repeat it many times through the game. The way they try to make you sympathize with Abby is by making Ellie look like the villain\\, really shows their writing skills. The dialogue is so bad and the only way they could have done that to Joel was by making him stupid.\rDon't believe those fake 10\/10 who literally give no explanation for their score. Only thing you'll see them say is \\\"masterpiece\\\"\\,\\\"game of the year\\\"\\,\\\"amazing story\\\"\\,\\\"don't listen to the haters\\\". In other words they say \\\"dude trust me\\\". They don't back up their opinion at all unlike all the people who give it a negative score who explain why they did so.\rFinal words:\rComplete garbage\\, a waste of time and money. Keep your money for Ghost of Tsushima or Cyberpunk.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
