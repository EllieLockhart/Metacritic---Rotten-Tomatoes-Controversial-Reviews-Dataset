Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was enjoyable on a very surface level.\\nThe start\\, really good\\, the end\\, really good.\\nThe middle part\\, almost ruins the entire movie.\\n\\nNot to mention that there were huge plot holes that\\, once the credits roll and you leave the theater\\, that glow of enjoyment just 'drains' after you start thinking \\\"why couldn't they do *blank due to not wanting to give away spoilers* sooner with *spoilers*\\\"\\n\\\"Why did \\\"X\\\" character keep \\\"X\\\" secret because there was no reason\\\"\\nIt was a flashy movie\\, but all but one or two characters actually has 'depth' given to them\\, all the others were very shallow and token.  There's even one character that takes up a large portion of the movie but had so little depth\\, if you changed 'one' thing about the movie\\, this character could have been removed and made the movie better and shorter.\\n\\nThe only reason I watched this movie was because it had \\\"Star Wars\\\" written on it\\, and if you removed that and judged it from it's own merits\\, it wouldn't have a leg to stand on.","true":true}
