Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time ever posting a review. Signed up jus to express how truly disappointed I am with this movie. I'm hoping there's enough backlash to make Lucasfilm reconsider their relationship with this writer\/director. I am so sad. Shocking to see how critic reviews have obviously been influenced either through money or fear.","true":true}
