Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the hate that this film is receiving is totally unfounded. People are so wrapped up in what they thought should happen that they miss what is right in front of there faces. Sometimes the best things are are those that we did not expect. Everyone was pissed when TFA was a somewhat rehash but now you get a completely different Star Wars story that opens up a completely different direction in the third movie and everyone loses their minds.","true":true}
