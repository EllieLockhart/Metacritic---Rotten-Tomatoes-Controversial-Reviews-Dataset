Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of pathos and the most dramatic Star Wars film since Revenge of the Sith and Empire\\, this is the Star Wars sequel I've been waiting for. The controversy over this film is over fans expectations being flipped on them. That's what made the film so interesting. If you set yourself up expecting the typical and predictable way that everyone thought things were going to go\\, then tha's your fault. Star Wars was due for a new direction and Rian Johnson executed this beautifully. There are of course nitpicks and plot holes\\, but every film in the series has them. Three scenes in the film made me quite emotional\\, and it kind of disturbs me that one of them made people upset. Star Wars fans don't know what they want. I personally am glad that we are past the days of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The cinematography\\, visuals\\, and performances by Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver in particular were all amazing\\, and I can't wait to see them continue to evolve. Decide for yourself and don't let anyone call you an idiot or not a true fan for enjoying the movie.","true":true}
