The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"After finishing the game last night after 25 or so hours \\, my conclusion is that the world of the last of us created in this game is second to none\\, the graphics and visuals are most likely the best we will see in this console generation and the developers should at least pride themselves for knowing that\\, on their side\\, they created a game that improves on part one in every single way.... but then there\u2019s the story. I knew about some of the leaks coming into the game\\, but I was determined to beleive that a full games worth of context would let me gauge my own opinion and hope it would be a positive one... but I\u2019m sad to say that I beleive our beloved characters were sacrificed\\, to enforce the themes of hate and revenge and how it ultimately will lead to your own demise\\, forcing the characters to make severely uncharacteristic throughout\\, so it can find it\u2019s way to force this message down your throat. I feel like their were elements of the story\\, mostly the flashbacks\\, that were genuinely beautiful to watch\\, so I can\u2019t help but think that they had the ingredients to make a serviceable part two\\, but instead chose to further clamp down on its heavy message\\, sacrificing characters logic from the first game and force you to watch all of your favourite characters steadily decline to the point where there is nothing left\\, and by the games credits\\, I felt numb knowing that Ellie ultimately leaves with nothing... even her memory of Joel and the legacy she could have carries on\\, while also knowing that the antagonist gets to sail away with a renewed sense of hope and purpose in finding her community again. In a way I feel attacked for loving these characters\\, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m being punished for it. In conclusion\\, if your favourite part about this franchise is Joel and Ellie\\, then although this game is incredibly beautiful with a moody\\, second to none atmosphere.... you will end up with your heart broken knowing where their Stories end up ... and mislead by the fact that you play as the antagonist for literally half the game. I think I\u2019m going to take the good parts of this game and theorise my own ending that the characters actually deserve to have.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
