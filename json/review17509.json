Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I seriously wanted to \\\"unsee\\\" this film after watching it but unfortunately it has now infected every cell in my brain and destroyed the Star Wars (SW) magic I adore. Please do NOT let Rian Johnson anywhere near another SW film. What was Disney thinking to get this so wrong? From the way the trilogy is going it seems Disney is killing off all the original cast as soon as possible without making any effective cinematic use of them. I am all for bringing in a new generation of characters to replace the original cast for the future but the out-of-character cameo roles for the original cast are so insulting for fans (and probably the actors involved). This film was also a hotchpotch of ideas with no real build up of excitement or story-telling. I left the cinema very disappointed.","true":true}
