Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have neither the time nor the energy to adequately tell you how much I hate this movie and all it stands for. It's an insult to fans everywhere and I hope Rian Johnson never gets his hands on a Star Wars film again.\\n\\nFor a more reasoned and detailed review\\, please watch this video. It speaks for me\\, as it does for so many of the Star Wars fans that Disney is systematically alienating.\\n\\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vw7pcCj0ORk","true":true}
