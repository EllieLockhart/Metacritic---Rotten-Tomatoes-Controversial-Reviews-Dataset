Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't feel like a start wars movie. The graphics and action was great but I feel like another director would have made better use of the story set up by the previous movie. Also a big part of the movie is a side story that didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.","true":true}
