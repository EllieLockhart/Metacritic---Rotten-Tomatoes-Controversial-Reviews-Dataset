Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Middle movies are always very hard to leave from satisfied however this movie did it! While there were many questions answered there were also enough left unanswered for the next movie without making the audience feel cheated or teased. Rian Johnson is brilliant and he has brought a fresh new perspective to Star Wars that has been needed for a long time. Unexpected and original. Also a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. While there are some moments that are a bit cheesy I don't think it would be Star Wars without a few moments like that. It's not a movie about a specific hero or some greatness. Its about the hero and greatness in all of us. It's a Star Wars movie that we needed.\\nHighly recommend. However don't go expecting to watch a rehash of Empire Strikes back or Return of the Jedi. This movie stands on it's own feet in the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
