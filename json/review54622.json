Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In all honesty\\, out of all the star wars movies\\, this one is my least favorite. It's not an absolutely terrible movie\\, but it's one I won't buy\\, and I absolutely don't plan on seeing it again in theatres. \\n\\nthere were two major problems with it\\, and both are related to eachother. First\\, Every other star wars movie had a huge major plot. Everything was boiling down to one thing\\, and at least fairly early you had a pretty good idea of what it was. They all have a lot of pressure on whatever the characters are doing\\, to the point it really matters\\, and you really care. This movie didn't have that same feel. Everything all the characters were working towards seemed so miner. Such a trivial task that would have been addressed 5 minutes into any of the other movies.\\n\\nThe second thing is that in order to meet such a trivial plot\\, all the characters had to drag out a bunch of other even more minor roles. It felt like everything going on was a bunch of irrelevant side quests created just to fill up time.\\n\\nOverall\\, not a movie I'd recommend to any friends\\, and I don't plan on watching it again.","true":true}
