Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was definitely the best non-original-trilogy movie of the series and possibly the best overall. It had the most interesting plot\\, the best fight scene\\, the best acting. It wasn't perfect but it was still fantastic.","true":true}
