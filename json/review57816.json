Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was looking forward to seeing the movie if you look at the critics reviews you would assume it's going to be very good.\\nI'm afraid it isn't there are bits on the middle of the film that are boring where i nearly fell asleep (im not joking) the film is 30 mins too long.\\nWhat they have done with the Luke Skywalker character turning him into a grumpy old man living in a cave just doesn't stack up.\\n\\nIn the original films and even the recent ones the Emperor was a really good character with a back story.The whole Snoke thing what a waste of time the whole story was pretty weak.\\nWhen i read the reviews from fans i thought they were being harsh but they were bang on the money.\\nI preferred all the prequels to this movie at least the The Force Awakens felt like a Star Wars movie this didn't even feel like one be interesting to see where they take it from here!","true":true}
