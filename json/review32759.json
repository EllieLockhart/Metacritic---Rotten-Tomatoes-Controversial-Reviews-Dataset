Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi turned out to be everything I wanted and everything I didn't know I wanted. Surprising twists and turns and tuly amazing spectacle. It was never going to please everyone\\, with the growing pressure of expectation and how the fans have in their own mind how it will play out. But for me\\, for any expectation that wasn't met\\, they blew my mind by taking risks and making new a fresh decisions. \\n\\nThis is a movie about character and their journeys. About choices\\, past and present and consequences. Yes there is amazing set pieces\\, beautifully executed wide shots that deserve to be displayed on your wall. I can see this getting better with every watch. \\n\\nThere is one storyline that drags and almost proved pointless. But the actors and characters are still likeable enough to keep them fun enough.\\n\\nAfter The Force Awakens I was so glad Star Wars was back\\, after The Last Jedi I am excited for where Star Wars is going.","true":true}
