Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of Star Wars\\, this movie shattered my expectations in the most negative way possible. Major plot holes\\, unnecessary diversions\\, and disappointing revelations made this movie frustrating for a loyal fan. Change in a series is good; it keeps both old and young generations intrigued. However\\, change for the sake of itself with no homage to the saga from which it originates is a true shame.","true":true}
