Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will definitely be seeing again in the theaters.  A fun\\, rollicking ride.  Middle movies in trilogies are difficult\\, but this is interesting\\, has good arcs\\, growing characters\\, and surprising moments.  (I also would rate eps 1\\,2\\,3\\,7 at 5 stars\\, not so much 4\\,5\\,6.)","true":true}
