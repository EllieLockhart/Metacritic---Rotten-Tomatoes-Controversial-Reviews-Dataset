Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what the actual fuck?? no one thought that this would turn out like this. what a mess. leia couldn't do shit with the force in tfa. and now we see it's possible to transport or whatever the hell it was.And what was the purpose of introducing mysterious villain like snoke if you had planned to kill him in the next movie\\, what a waste of a character. Walking out of the theater\\, I realized what a waste of money it was\\, and here I read that war for the planet of the apes is below average\\, smh :(","true":true}
