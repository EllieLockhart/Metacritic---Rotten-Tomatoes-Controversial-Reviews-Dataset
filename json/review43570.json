Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was more like one of the prequels than the original trilogy or Force Awakens\/Rogue One. As I was watching one of the absolutely ridiculous scenes in this movie\\, it occurred to me that Star Wars might have officially jumped the shark. Star Wars fanatics will poke holes in this left and right\\, but the general pop will be happy with it.","true":true}
