Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't put my finger on it but it didn't seem like a star wars movie to me. All the one liners and pointless CGI critters seemed to take away from the story. Overall it felt like vase that was broken and glued back together with wrong pieces.","true":true}
