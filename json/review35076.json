Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I felt like I could connect to a Star Wars film. I was horribly disappointed with Rogue One and this made up for it. Visually stunning\\, wonderful character development\\, and steller performances made this one stand out. We will be hearing complaints from disappointed fans who were raised on the prequel trilogy for a long time though. Because this film does away with all the things that make Jedi special and nessary. Thank god.","true":true}
