Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get all the fan hate this is getting\\, thought it was a really great entry in the franchise. People complain Force Awakens was too much like A New Hope and now this one is much different and people still complain\\, lol. Sure there are things that could have been done better\\, but I had a blast watching it.","true":true}
