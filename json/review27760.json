Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People who didn't like this movie are the same people who would have been mad no matter who Rey's parents and Snoke ended up being.  Leaving unanswered questions of origin and parentage allows for further reveals down the road while the death of characters allows for expansion beyond the original franchise in new and fresh directions.\\n\\n--lifelong fan","true":true}
