Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For those hating on it\\, they do so because of the memories of their childhood But this is a really good movie that does a great job pulling the threads of all other Star Wars movies together to tell a really good story once you detach the emotional shock of what happens ","true":true}
