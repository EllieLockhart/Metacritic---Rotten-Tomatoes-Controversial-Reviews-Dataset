Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to the movie last week and loved it.  It was not only visually gorgeous but quite intriguing. I came into the movie without expectations that the movie OWED me my own personal conclusions. I'm currently disgusted at the trolls that came in to place 1\/2 star ratings. Such ratings are wildly inaccurate. This film is a work of love from people that respect the source material enough to not give viewers Empire version 2.0.","true":true}
