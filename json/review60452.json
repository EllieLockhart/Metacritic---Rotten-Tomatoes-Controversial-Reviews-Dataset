This is the kind of game that stays with you long after you\u2019re done. My husband enjoyed watching me play it like a movie\\, and we found ourselves discussing various topics that this beautiful games makes you think about while you\u2019re playing it...the meaning of life\\, what it means to be human\\, revenge\\, love\\, forgiveness\\, understanding\\, etc. I can\u2019t remember the last time a game made me really think. And feel every spectrum of emotions while playing it. I felt immensely satisfied at the end\\, like I had just been on the adventure of a lifetime that changed the way I looked at the world a little bit.
