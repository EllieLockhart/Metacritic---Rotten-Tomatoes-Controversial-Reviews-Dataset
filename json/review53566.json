Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Expectations were high for this movie. JJ set a fantastic (if a little safe) setting for this movie to be dark and character driven\\, and it fails on both accounts. It feels like we were forced to like new characters that had little to no development\\, and the characters we had started to like (i.e. Rey\\, Poe\\, etc.) had very little in that of meaningful roles. The heavy build up for Luke was also completely squandered. It's as if Rian Johnson watched (or maybe didn't watch) The Force Awakens and said\\, \\\"You know what would be hilarious? If we took every last drop of meaningful story from the last movie and tossed it out the window for a quick 2-second chuckle.\\\" \\n\\nI was so ready for this movie to take us to the next step in terms of learning Rey's past\\, seeing Kylo's struggle with exactly which side of the force he falls on\\, watching Luke rise to become the teacher that was always inside of him\\, giving Leia a meaningful and memorable departure\\, and this is just to name a few... and they failed on all accounts.\\n\\nThere were many moments I really did enjoy\\, many of which were homages to the older movies. But movies can't survive on nostalgia alone. Hopefully JJ can salvage Episode IX and help bring this series back to it's former glory.\\n\\nI still have hope.","true":true}
