Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was nostalgic to watch The Last Jedi with my son\\, 40 years after taking him and his brother to see the first Star Wars. It was not wax poetic to see Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker again\\, who both graduated from the Chewbacca School of Acting. Paying homage to original characters and adding new animal creatures does not justify the movie length of 2.5 hours. I really liked the battle scenes and the special effects\\, but after 40 years\\, I left wanting something new.","true":true}
