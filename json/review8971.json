Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From reading other reviews I expected this movie to be a complete bomb\\, but I liked it. It wasn\u2019t quite as good as The Force Awakens\\, but it was very good. Many in the crowd applauded at the end. ","true":true}
