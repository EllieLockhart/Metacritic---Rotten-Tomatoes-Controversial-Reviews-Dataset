Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, I'm a huge fan and I even liked the prequels.\\n\\nWhere the Force Awakens struggled with a bit of a generic plot it laid the groundwork of an intriguing plot and state of the well-known and loved universe far far away. In this movie\\, all the interesting plot threads from the previous movie are haphazardly thrown aside for mundane and largely unnecessary stories that leave you with a bitter aftertaste.\\n\\nThe actors are the only positive aspect of the movie\\, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley in particular showcasing their talents as actors.  The characters however are another thing\\, where Rey and Finn were both lovable and interesting they now feel distant and uninteresting\\, uninteresting being a keyword to describe most of the film itself.\\n\\nAnother problem that the film suffers from is that there is so much space for the interesting plots\\, so many opportunities to throw a plot twist that could make the story interesting\\, yet it seems to tease it only to hesitate and instead make another side plot which only makes you groan. The plot twists in this movie instead prove to be disastrous to the established story and lore.","true":true}
