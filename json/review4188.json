Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far my favorite Star Wars movie today. This movie have my A new hope vibes and empire strikes back motives. Actors are great\\, cast is well picked\/ performed. Snook the new character had really no role and no developed being killed early... poor plot choice\/ disappointment. Some subplots such as the character role rose were aways undeveloped\\, and throw aways. A lot of surprising changes within main characters and plot changes\\, somewhat negative... although very fun\\, this film does a good job of not providing fan service and leaving a unpredictable sequel.","true":true}
