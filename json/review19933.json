Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was exactly what I expected it to be: another meh Star Wars movie.  Yes\\, it had beautiful visuals and many twists and surprises\\, but the plot lines and characters were shallow\\, forgettable\\, and illogical in equal measure. I won't say TLJ is the worst film I've seen in 2017 but is definitely the most meaningless.","true":true}
