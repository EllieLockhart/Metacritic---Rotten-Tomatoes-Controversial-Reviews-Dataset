Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has a story\\, it had a direction but what direction it was going makes me ponder. This is not a good star wars film at all. Rogue One and The Force Awakens were much better. Wait for Netflix on this one.","true":true}
