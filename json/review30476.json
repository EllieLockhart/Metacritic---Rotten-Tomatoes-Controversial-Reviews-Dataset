Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shame on the professional critics who rated this movie highly. The influence from Disney on the reviews listed here is obvious. Character development\\, plot continuity\\, or even a grade school understanding of physics are all noticeably absent from this sad excuse of a movie. This poorly written and soulless cash grab concerns itself more with providing a backdrop for the selling of merchandise than it does with the telling of a clear narrative. The visual effects are terrific\\, but no amount of flashing lightsabers or exhausted John Williams can spare it from the mortal wound that is bad writing.","true":true}
