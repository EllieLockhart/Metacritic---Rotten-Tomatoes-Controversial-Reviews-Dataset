Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I went to theaters\\, I did it only for a friend. I was thinking: not another Star Wars. Even though I did enjoy the last two\\, I am usually very sceptic about franchises that continue to live up the hype.\\n\\nWell\\, I was proven wrong. Rian Johnson managed to make something completely new. He gave the heart and soul of the movie to their actors. And that was absolutely the right thing to do. Especially the story surrounding the astonishing Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley as well as Mark Hamill\\, clearly the coolest supporting actor in 2017\\, is very well told. Without completely losing the franchise\\, the film added something new\\, some more religious or philosophical aspects. \\n\\nTo me\\, it was the most 'different' Star Wsrs of all time\\, and I can totally see why it left many fans of the franchise disappointed. But\\, similar to Blade Runner earlier that year\\, Rian Johnson brought Star Wars to a new level\\, a less entertaining one\\, but a version that is full of quality and sense.\\n\\nM.E.G.","true":true}
