Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite looking good on screen and doing well as a movie on its own\\, Rian Johnson often forgets the movie he is directing and writing is a Star Wars movie\\, and in subverting audience expectations derails entire characters and personalities\\, and commits the greatest flaw a sequel or interquel can ever commit - not advancing the plot. That's the main problem\\, really. Admittedly\\, as a single film\\, it is nice\\, but as the Star Wars film and as a follow-up and a bridge to the upcoming Rise of Skywalker\\, it fails at its job on a mind-blowing level.","true":true}
