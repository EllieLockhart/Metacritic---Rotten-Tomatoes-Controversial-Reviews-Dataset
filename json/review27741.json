Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"people need to stop blaming the movie because they wasted their time on snoke theories\\, only to have him die half way through without answers. He obviously wasn't relevant to the story anymore. His purpose was to turn Kylo that's it. The movie was brilliant. ignore all negative comments made by certain fans.","true":true}
