Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to give credit to this movie. I see it on release night like every star wars but I didn't feel any magic this time. I get bored very quickly over uninteresting plot and was very sad to even feel that way. Most of the movie feel like fillers and the only interesting part (Luke and Rey most of it) feel anticlimactic. The force awakens was not perfect but at least I still lived it and feel it every time I see it but not this one.","true":true}
