Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson how did you mess up this big? I could go on for all of the small details that were piled over the course of the whole movie but really all you need to know is that it hurts the already established Star Wars universe. Its great to see Mark Hamill reprise his role as Luke Skywalker\\, but the hopeful good-hearted Luke that we knew and loved is gone. In Last Jedi we get a grumpy old man that has given up on the Jedi cause. I'd give it half a star but gotta give credit where credit is due\\, and there ain't much to talk about. Once again like Force Awakens\\, this movie is visually amazing\\, the sets\\, costumes and CGI are fantastic and so pleasing to the eye\\, but that far from makes up for the hugely poor choices in the screenplay. So many moments that are meant to make us feel strong emotional reactions fall completely flat.","true":true}
