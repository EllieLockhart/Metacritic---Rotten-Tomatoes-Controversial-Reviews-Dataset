Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long boring movie with sub par action scenes and a plot that adds absolutely no explanation about its characters. I didn't think episodes 1-3 could ever be better than anything else star wars made but Disney prove me wrong","true":true}
