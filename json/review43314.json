Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great film. \\n\\nThe worst part is the abject rejection of it by some hardcore Star Wars fans. \\n\\nIt doesn't fall directly in line with expectations and challenges the themes of older movies. So that upsets the fragile ego of some of the super fans. \\n\\nThere were some mild pacing issues. And a little too many jokes in poignant moments. But overall it should be remembered as one the great Star Wars films. \\n\\nDon't let the sour superfans turn you away from this exciting and entertaining Episode in the Star Wars Saga.","true":true}
