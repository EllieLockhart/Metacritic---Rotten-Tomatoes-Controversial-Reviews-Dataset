{"101487":167006,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Similar to The Force Awakens\\, this might be a movie I'll have to re-evaluate once the trilogy is concluded.  As it stands now\\, I liked it.  But I did have problems with it\\, and more problems that are hard to ignore and more than The Force Awakens.\\nI'm just going to get the bad stuff out of the way.  Finn's arc is pointless.  It builds the universe more and gives some interesting commentary\\, but it felt really unnecessary.  When it comes to the main story\\, there are some plot points that were built up and just dropped off a cliff.  Rey's parentage actually didn't bother me\\, I kinda' liked it\\, but Snoke's role here just pissed me off.  It felt like an attempt to be unexpected and edgy but instead it just came off like a disrespect for the mythology that was being created.  The biggest problem though is how small the movie can feel.  We're following the final remnants of the rebellion\\, but considering where the last film left off I find that kind of hard to believe.  Additionally\\, this makes things feel very limited.  Force Awakens had a lot of repeat\\, but the task they were facing felt huge.  Here\\, they're really just running and trying to survive.  That could be huge\\, the last flashes of the rebellion trying to survive\\, that could be big\\, but it never feels that big.\\nI only give Star Wars crap because I love it so.  And the thing is\\, despite all its flaws\\, I did still like this entry.  It is the next chapter in these character's stories\\, and even if the plot has issues the characters still work.  I like seeing Luke again\\, even if he is older and grumpier he's still Luke.  Finn and Rey are still enjoyable as our new leads\\, and Rey in particular goes through some serious stuff in this entry and I was totally invested in her journey.  There's also some really solid action scenes\\, including a fight with those red guards who we never before got to see fight that is just awesome to witness.\\nThe Last Jedi gives us a lot of awesome stuff\\, but it doesn't give enough of what I wanted to see.  Still\\, if I'm distinguishing between what I wanted and what I got\\, what I got was still mostly solid.  It's not perfect\\, and its flaws really bug me\\, but the characters are still great and it still feels like classic Star Wars.  It leads the franchise in a direction I'm not sure what to expect from.  Force Awakens brought things back on track\\, and The Last Jedi sends things in an unexpected direction.  With where things end here\\, I am for the first time with Star Wars completely unsure of what to expect next\\, and honestly that's pretty exciting.","true":true}
