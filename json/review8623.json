Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First Star Wars movie I've been to where people walked out of the theater. I was able to forgive all the silly plot points because its freaking Star Wars fans are used to it. You can't ruin the character of Luke Skywalker though all while making Mark Hamill drink from an aliens tata and not expect half of the fan base to absolutely hate the movie with a fiery passion.","true":true}
