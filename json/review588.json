How am I supposed to know which one is right? Even in real-life scenarios you'd probably be depending on luck and guesses\\, so I won't crucify the game for that.\r\rThe characters are rather one-dimensional and stereotypical in nature. Most became so annoying that I'd happily have watched them all die were it not counter-intuitive to winning the game. This is true of a lot of teenage slasher films\\, so you could also argue they captured this fairly well.\r\rThe exploration and character movement however\\, was painfully slow and monotonous. Sections of the game were tedious and monotonous\\, meaning I couldn't wait for the final chapter for the wrong reasons. Much of the game was dark\\, so there wasn't even much interest to be had with manually controlling the character anyway.\r\rThe story is decent and not overly complex. I found myself wondering why the hell they chose to come back to a deathly location in the first place\\, but again this is horror movie logic we're dealing with.\r\rOverall\\, I want to give kudos for the developers attempting to do something different and would love to see this improved on in future where it could make for a very good game. Life Is Strange showed some very good promise also before faltering in its sequels\\, so I would love to see this genre expand and evolve. I can still recommend this game\\, but just know what you're getting into\\, unlike the kids in this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
