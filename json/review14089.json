Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're looking for answers to the burning questions from TFA\\, don't hold your breath. And the couple of answers you do get are pretty disappointing. I didn't hate this movie\\, there were some great scenes\\, dialogue and action\\, but then there were also a lot of pointless scenes which served no purpose and a couple of baffling demises. Can't understand why they would hype up a couple of characters SO much in TFA only to have them fizzle in TLJ so easily. Luke is a legend\\, but he was treated abysmally in this movie. Not the return to the big screen he deserved. They have 3 different writers on this trilogy - so I suppose how can there be any seamlessness and cohesion and when they all have a different vision?","true":true}
