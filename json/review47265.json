Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a shame this movie is.  It is little more than a giant\\, flashy missed opportunity for storytelling.  Character development is non-existent\\, the plot is inconsistent and leaves you feeling frustrated and befuddled rather than satisfied.  It is out of place in the franchise and just not an enjoyable experience.  Missed the mark by a mile.","true":true}
