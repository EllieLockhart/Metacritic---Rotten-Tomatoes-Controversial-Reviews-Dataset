Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage. Disney literally spit on the characters Luke Skywalker and Yoda\\, along with everything about them from the OT and prequels. They made a mockery of Leia\\, and therefore Carrie Fisher\\, in one of the most cringeworthy scenes ever to hit the screen. They turned Snokes into a cartoon background villain. The plot and backstory are ridiculous. And every interesting question raised in TFA is just ignored or hand waved in this movie. It's as if this is a soft reboot of TFA.\\n\\nA sad\\, pathetic\\, cringe inducing reboot.\\n\\nThey way they butchered Luke's character though...having grown up with Star Wars I feel like I've been punched in the gut.\\n\\nDon't buy tickets to this movie. Don't rent it. Don't even watch it once it's available for free. It's absolute trash.","true":true}
