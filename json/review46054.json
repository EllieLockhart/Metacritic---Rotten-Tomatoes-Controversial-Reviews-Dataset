Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning but that's about it. This movie tries so hard to tear down the old pillars of star wars but forgets to build a new foundation. The plot is hole-ridden and the characters are conveniences with developments that don't seem to matter. As a star wars movie this was pretty bad. As a regular blockbuster it was pretty forgettable.","true":true}
