Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good visuals don't save a lacking story and poor characterization. The story could work as an anthology film\\, but falls completely short as the second of the new trilogy - the film portrays itself as edgy\/artsy but fails to build on the previous film and even manages to betray its own stakes at every turn. I am left with no anticipation for what happens next or interest in the new characters. \\n\\nThe visuals are great though! +1 star just for that","true":true}
