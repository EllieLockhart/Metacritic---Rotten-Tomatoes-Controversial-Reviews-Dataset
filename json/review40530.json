{"101487":183078,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the Star Wars movie the audience has been asking for.\\nWhile The Force Awakens provided a space to bask in nostalgia\\, The Last Jedi goes all out\\, no holds barred\\, in an action packed\\, emotionally driven\\, creative installment\\, while managing to remain grounded in the tropes we know\\, love\\, and expect; along with a few stunning surprises. \\n\\nWe are dealing with more main characters than any other Star Wars movie before\\, and each one is given a solid story line\\, with clear motivations\\, and satisfying arcs. \\nWe witness Finn grow from his cowardly self-driven tenancies to a hero of the Resistance (can I get a Han Solo parallel up in here?).\\nPoe Dameron leads a desperate mutiny\\, confident that he can turn the tide for his fading comrades\\, only to be proven so very wrong\\, and better prepared to lead the few who remain in the next movie when they may be able to \\\"burn the First Order down\\\". \\nLeia\\, Carrie Fisher. While this is the last time we will see the beloved Princess turned General\\, her screen time was not wasted. She lives on. Although her using the force to fly through space\\, and into a coma is a debatable cinematic choice\\, Leia is a guiding character to which all others set their compass. \\nThe best use of a character could be Laura Dern's role as Admirable Holdo. We do not like or understand her choices for the majority of the film. But as her plan is revealed and executed\\, we are rewarded with one of the most awe inspiring moments in the entire franchise history. A character we are pitted against has us standing in encore at her exit.\\nRose\\, while she may be the most cliche of any of the characters presented\\, she provides a critical lens for which to view the wars in which we are so happily entrenched.\\nLuke Skywalker. Mark Hamill\\, Welcome back\\, oh how you have been missed. Leaning into the Hermit Life\\, Luke denies the use of the Force and his guilt has over powered any allegiance he may have to 'The Good Fight' or his sister. He is afraid of what he awoke in his nephew\\, and we learn (through some questionable use of flashbacks)\\, that it is a moment of weakness on Luke's part\\, which has lead to the turmoil which exists now. From giving the audience\\, and Rey\\, the best explanation of the Force to date\\, to wanting to burn down all that the Jedi once was\\, to facing his fears\\, guilt\\, and nephew\\, Luke's story is complete and brilliantly told. \\nKylo Ren \/ Ben Solo. This is the villain we always deserved to have. The conflict in him is clear\\, and understandable. His choices are daring\\, and jaw-dropping\\, and epic. Facing down two of his masters in one movie; Killing Snoke while Snoke is reading his mind\\, blasting Luke with all the firepower at his disposal\\, Kylo\/Ben is growing up and unlike his grandfather before him\\, his motivations are crystal clear\\, to the point when he turns to Rey after their fight with the guards\\, the audience is awaiting him to offer her a partnership\\, to rule the Galaxy together\\, and it is exactly the draw to make a Jedi say \\\"Yes.\\\"\\nRey. A nobody\\, untainted by the parameters of the expectations of Light and Dark. She is looking for answers and will find them any way possible. Rey ventures to the physical Dark Side of Ahch-To\\, and much like when Luke fights a vision of Vader in a cave on Degobah\\, the only answer she finds is: herself. Unlike Luke\\, Rey has no fear of the Dark Side\\, in herself\\, or in Kylo\/Ben\\, or anywhere else. She is a new form of Jedi\\, stronger and more sure than ever before. Not to mention her scrappy fighting skills are something I am so here for! The journey she leads of hating Kylo Ren to having compassion and sympathy for Ben Solo\\, gives significant weight to the choices they each make at the climax of the film.\\nThe rest of the ensemble is full and rich\\, filled with our beloved original cast\\, and new character who are easy to root for.\\n \\nHighlight is undoubtedly the flawless sequence of events from Rey landing on Snoke's ship\\, to the equal balance of the Force which is so powerful it breaks Anikan's lightsaber in half. That story line deserves a review by itself. Costuming\\, music\\, revelations\\, betrayal\\, synergy between Kylo\/Ben and Rey as they fight together (it's as if you can actually see the Force)\\, there is nothing to change from the start to finish of that. \\n\\nWhile the flaws abound; \\\"Native Caretakers\\\" on the Jedi Island? Are we talking about colonialism here? C-3PO's apparent uselessness is increasingly irritating\\, where once he was irritating and endearing. The pace was lopsided\\, lots of Force Bond visions\\, and flashbacks\\, and running away\\, and side-plots in the the first half\\, which could've been cut down. Why are all the animals sentient?? Trying to make Han's gold dice Easter Egg into a tangible\\, relatable\\, thing fell flat. Use of Yoda (shout out for the puppet though)\\, as well as Benicio Del Torro's character seemed forced and misplaced. What this movie does well far outweighs any misgivings in relation to production choices. \\n\\nAny good story leaves the audience with more questions; How on earth will anything happen for The Resistance in the next film? What about the Knights of Ren? What does the First Order do under Supreme Leader Kylo Ren? The Force is balanced\\, isn't that what we always wanted it to be? Do we see more of these little no body kids turning into Jedi and Sith across the Galaxy? Will the next installment take place immediately after\\, like all the rest\\, or will we jump forward in time a bit? Is there a romantic story line or will Poe just continue to smolder at everyone he interacts with? (...because I'm so okay with that!).  \\n\\nWith The Last Jedi we are a given a more complicated picture of the Galaxy. A picture which shows the story is more than simply Light vs. Dark\\, Jedi equals good\\, Sith bad. We get nuance and complications\\, and main characters who explore more than what their institutionalized religion has taught them. It allows the next movie to be whatever it needs to be\\, and I believe the franchise has set us up\\, extremely well\\, for the unexpected.  \\n\\nAlso\\, John Williams friends. Seamless\\, and perfect.","true":true}
