{"101487":197053,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why Last Jedi is bad:\\n\\nDeliberate cliffhangers.  Aside from 1-3\\, where they are more like a single movie broken up into 3 parts\\, the movies hadn't deliberately left major plot points teased\\, but unanswered.\\n\\nSure\\, we didn't find out Darth was Luke's father until Empire\\, but we didn't know it was an issue until then either.\\n\\nWe didn't find out Luke and Leia were siblings until RotJ\\, but didn't know it was an issue until then\\, either.\\n\\nThis time\\, they deliberately set up a Rey family plotline\\, then have deliberately not solved it.  They tease ideas from the expanded unverse\\, but don't go all-in\\, or explain them.\\n\\nThe entire \\\"tracker disable\\\" subplot seems like someone read the finished script\\, then said \\\"that's fine\\, but it'd be better with a mini-Rogue One shoehorned into the middle.\\\"  No\\, it's not.  It just slowed things down\\, and distracted from the main plot.\\n\\nCut that while subplot\\, and the movie gets better.  Cut it before you start shooting\\, and you spend more time on the training montage.\\n\\nIt's also the first (outside 2-3) that's hard to watch\/follow as a stand-alone.  The first 4 (made\\, not episode numbers) are quite watchable without having seen any others or knowing what Star Wars is.  This one fails on that.  It assumes you've seen Awakens\\, but doesn't assume you know the rest\\, so it seems inconsistent. And that makes people uncomfortable\\, even if they can't understand why at the screening.\\n\\nShorten in.  You know more movies are being made after\\, so don't rush plot points\\, or include too many\\, just to tick boxes.  Simplify and it'll be better.  More time for action.  More time for training.  More time for plot.  So it'll be a fuller\\, more well rounded movie.  The \\\"plot\\\" seemed to be small justifications for more action.  The action was all over the place\\, but it didn't seem as plot-driven as it needed to be.\\n\\nIn all\\, that made the movie more a mess than masterpiece.  It's enjoyable now\\, but if the next is any good\\, this will be the most forgettable of the lot.  A filler to get from #1 to #3.  Empire was never that.  This movie tried to be Empire\\, while avoiding Empire so much that it never found its identity.  It could have been a shot for shot remake of Empire\\, with some dialogue updates for the changes\\, and been better than what we got.\\n\\nIt was bad because it would have been so easy to have made it better.","true":true}
