Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. One third of the movie was an unnecessary plot line and simply a waste of time. Many serious scenes contain unnecessary\\, out of place humor. I spent the whole movie hoping that the empire would just finish off the resistance simply to put an end to the tragedy that is now Disney Star Wars. Someone needs to please call George Lucas and apologize for murdering his baby.","true":true}
