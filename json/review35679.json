Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an utter disappointment and disaster. The Last Jedi has a ridiculous and terrible plot\\, Luke is the worst development character\\, Snoke was a complete waste of great potential as a villain\\, and the movie does very little in expanding the world of Star Wars.","true":true}
