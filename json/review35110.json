Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens clenched on to remnants of a bygone era. Audiences that liked the force awakens for the similarities to the previous films is something I completely disagree with\\, even as I walked into The Last Jedi. If you keep rewriting the past have you really had any meaningful development? A universe as dense as Star Wars which is literally on the scale of stars begs to be epic and grand. The Last Jedi attempts to be grand but falters under the pressure. It's shockingly written\\, the dialogue is serviceable at best with characters engaging in mediocre conversations only to progress the plot\\, the comedic relief rarely lands\\, and the implausibility of certain actions\\, be it sequences in the film or out of character moments strain the audience's suspension of disbelief. But for all its flaws it does things that are refreshingly different by attempting to blur lines between the light and dark. The Last Jedi's real issue is that it shows a real disconnect in some ways to the future The Force Awakens alluded too. Dropping far too many subplots from the previous film without any significant pay off. It's a flawed film but that doesn't make it an irredeemable one. Littered with spectacular set pieces and equally frustrating moments but if you can sacrifice realism and logic for the sake enjoyment you might find something you really like in The Last Jedi's razzmatazz.","true":true}
