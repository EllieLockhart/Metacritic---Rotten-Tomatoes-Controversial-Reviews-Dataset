Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more you think about this movie the worse it becomes the director takes everything intresting about starwars and space combat and throws it out the window\\n\\nI Dont think the actors are bad I think the parts written for them are so terrible that it makes them look bad\\n\\nEpisode 7 was a little sketchy but had the basis of somthing much greater but so far the sequels are the worse films in the star wars franchise\\n\\nCongratulations\\n","true":true}
