Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a complete and total disgrace to the Star Wars and Luke Skywalker legacy. Thanks for turning my childhood hero into a sniveling coward. The man crossed the galaxy multiple times to face certain death to save his friends\\, redeem his father and rescue the galaxy. Now that his friend was killed by his own nephew and his sister is in danger and the rebellion is lost\\, he can't be bothered?!?! Sorry Johnson\\, wrong Luke. Oh\\, and a two out out of gas chase after three tie fighters wipe out the lead rebel cruiser in the blink of an eye? Really?!?! Don't get me started on Snoke\\, because\\, who cares anyway\\, right. Since I don't know a thing about him\\, why should I care about his fate anyway. Besides\\, the dumbass never even got up out of a chair for his entire existence. Should I mention training? Sure\\, why not since this director is so clueless he clearly hasn't even bothered to watch a single Star Wars movie where Jedi have to trained\\, duhhhhh. Luke Skywalker under the direct tutelage of one of the greatest Jedi in history\\, as well as Obi Wan Kenobi can barely move a small pile of rocks with the force\\, yet Rey\\, without a single\\, solitary moment of training can wipe out a half dozen imperial guards\\, hold off the Supreme Leader's apprentice and move half a mountain stone like its lint. Give me a break. Words cannot begin to describe the anger at this utter failure of a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
