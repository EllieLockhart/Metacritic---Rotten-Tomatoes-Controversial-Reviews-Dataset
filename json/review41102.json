Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had pacing issues. There were initially 3 story lines\\, one of which had way too much going on\\, and one which moved PAINFULLY slow. There were at least 3 times where the movie would cut back to Ray and Luke and they would repeat the scene:\\nRay: \\\"But you're the last hope\\\"\\nLuke: \\\"But I don't wanna\\\"\\nAnd that story arch was disappointing\\, didn't end up being super important.\\nAlso\\, SEVERAL scenes where they would zoom in on someone looking off into the distance\\nSEVERAL scenes where someone was giving an \\\"emotional speech\\\".\\nKept hitting you on the head with call backs to \\\"A new hope\\\". Did not live up to The Force Awakens\\, or Rogue One.","true":true}
