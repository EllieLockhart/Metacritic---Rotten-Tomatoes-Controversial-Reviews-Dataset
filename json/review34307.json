Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting\\, especially from the young actors and actresses\\, was among the best we've scene in a Star Wars film. The plot and screen writing by far the worst. This movie further obfuscates what was already a very confused and unexplained galactic state of affairs and further takes away from the legacy of episodes 1-6 and it's characters.","true":true}
