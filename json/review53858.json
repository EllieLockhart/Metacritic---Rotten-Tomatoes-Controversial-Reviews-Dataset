Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holly cow Batman the script is full of horrible clich\u00e9 dialogue\\, I found it simply excruciating to watch! Finn and Rose go on a stupid side quest to find a codebreaker and it leads nowhere! They turn Luke into a Jedi chump and a shell of a man. The worst part of the movie for me was the Mary Pop-ins treat meant of Leia and I felt insulted! Who tries to kill their mother? Over all a horrible Movie! I think this will be the last \\\"New\\\" Star Wars Movie I will ever watch! Just Horrible\\, only watch it if your inn need of a Star Wars fix. Its by far the worst Star Wars movie out of all of them!","true":true}
