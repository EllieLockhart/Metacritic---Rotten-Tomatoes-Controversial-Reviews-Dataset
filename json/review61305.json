The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This \u201cheartwarming\u201d story of forgiveness is ruined by the fact that Joel made the right decision when he saved Ellie from the Fireflies. The cure never would\u2019ve worked because A. It\u2019s a fungal infection and no one IRL has developed a vaccine for a fungal infection (watch Game Theory\u2019s video) B. Ellie was one of a good few immune people who the Fireflies previously failed to extract a vaccine from and C. Once a vaccine is made\\, then how do they apply it to save the world? They can\u2019t vaccinate everyone and a vaccine doesn\u2019t cure someone who is already infected. Not to mention the other factions of people who may try to steal the vaccine for themselves and ruin it all. There\u2019s too many possibilities that would make Ellie\u2019s death be for nothing so Joel made the right choice in saving her. So how in any way did he deserve to be killed by Abby?Abby\\, even by the end of the story\\, never became redeemable or in other words someone who deserved to be spared and forgiven. Let\u2019s not forget that Abby was the only one who got her revenge and she ENJOYED it\\, continuing to be a cruel\\, evil person. When Abby is told Dina is pregnant\\, she says \u201cgood\u201d and almost slits her throat. Compare that to Ellie\\, who after killing Mel (another pregnant woman) has a huge meltdown of guilt that causes her to be willing to go home until Abby shows up again and kills Jesse. Joel SAVED ABBYS LIFE in an act of trust and compassion and he gets punished by being brutally tortured and killed. Ellie ends up alone with no one left\\, and loses two fingers so she can\u2019t play guitar anymore\\, which was a personal connection to Joel.So\\, what\u2019s the message of this story? Abby gets the best ending out of all the characters. Abby\\, the one who got her revenge. So is revenge good? That\u2019s a horrible message and I don\u2019t see why anyone praises this game for having a compelling\\, thought-provoking message. The only message I got was that revenge and cruelty is good because you get on top of everyone else.The Last Of Us 1 is my favorite story of all time. I based a lot of my childhood off of it. I used to play WoW\\, and TLOU influenced me so much I became a survival hunter in order to be like Joel. So it\u2019s really insulting to me when some person tells me that I \u201cjust don\u2019t understand the deep message\u201d. TLOU\u2019s world may be one of only a few stories that I have a truly deep connection with\\, and TLOU 2 does not match up to it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
