Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You could skip this movie and miss nothing\\, half the plot lines do not matter and are only there to keep some characters busy while others have half  interesting adventures. The new characters are given lots of screen time to develop\\, but in the end they fall right back into where they were at the start of the film. Legacy characters are somehow simultaneously overused and underutilized. The villains are underwhelming\\, the heroes are given very little to do and the plot beats are just rearranged from Empire Strikes Back.  While there are some surprising twists in the film ultimately they all fall flat\\, often leaving the audience feeling like they were stupid for theorizing about characters from the previous films. However\\, the film does have incredible battles\\, every fight scene is engaging and beautiful\\, but all the exploding TIE fighters and clashing lightsabers in the galaxy couldn't save this stinker from a fate worse than the prequels.","true":true}
