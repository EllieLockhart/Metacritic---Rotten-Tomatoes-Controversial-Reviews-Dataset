{"101487":136256,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a die hard\\, true blue Star Wars fan. This movie is lacking at best. The story is not paced properly\\, there are scenes shoe horned in (casino city) for no reason other than to give some characters something to do. And every scene they added some quip or sarcastic remark to try and provide levity\\, but it came off as lazy and campy. A scene that us important to the mythology of Star Wars that needed to be heavy\\, was wasted by one liners. There were redeeming parts\\, like Poe's storyline. And dont get me started on Snoke\\, such a waste! Only episodes 1 and 2 are worse. The Last Jedi is the Batman vs. Superman of the anthology. Truly disappointed.","true":true}
