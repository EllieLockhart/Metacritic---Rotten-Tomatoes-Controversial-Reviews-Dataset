Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw it for the 2nd time\\, and I'm not really sure what movie those that hate it so bad were watching. Yes it vastly differs from all the fan theoried\\, but you know what... good for that. Shame you had such a terrible time\\, but for me (and I think alot of others) it was 2.5 hours of pure exhilaration. ","true":true}
