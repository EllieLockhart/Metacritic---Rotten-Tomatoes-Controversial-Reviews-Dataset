Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is fascinating and revealing that the critic vs. audience score of Star Wars: The Last Jedi resemble those associated with more \\\"thoughtful\\\"\\, \\\"complicated\\\" non-genre based movies. Critics love it and audiences don't. \\nIn this case\\, it seems that the weight of expectations and speculation based on J.J. Abrams penchant for mystery caused many to have strongly held preconceptions about the content of The Last Jedi.","true":true}
