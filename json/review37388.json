Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problems I have with this movie are already listed in other's reviews. If you want to take the story in a different direction\\, I'm okay with that.  However\\, they went so far that they made a film that didn't \\\"feel\\\" like \\\"Star Wars.\\\" At times I felt like I was watching a parody.","true":true}
