Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Undoubtedly the worst Star Wars film ever made\\, as well as the most disappointing film I've ever seen. The Last Jedi isn't only a terrible Star Wars film\\, it's a bad movie overall and should be deleted from the franchise completely. I feel awful for Mark Hamill. He waited 34 years to play Luke in another franchise film and Rian Johnson made a mockery of his legacy. Rotten Tomatoes has revealed to us all that they will give any movie a good score if there's enough money involved and all the Top Critics on here that gave it a good score have lost all of my respect.","true":true}
