Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to spoil anything\\, but there were too many unrealistic moments in this movie. I've been a Star Wars fan for my phone life. I've watched all of the movies\\, The Clone Wars\\, and myself to watch Rebels. All of the reasons why fans were looking forward the The Last Jedi were either unanswered or pointless. There were many plot fails and towards the middle of the story\\, I wanted to leave the movie theater. I've watched the movie twice now\\, and the second time wasn't any better. I could go on an hour long rant for this movie\\, but I don't have the time\/patients to do that. In conclusion\\, in my opinion\\, this is one of\\, if not\\, THE WORST Star Wars movie I've ever seen.","true":true}
