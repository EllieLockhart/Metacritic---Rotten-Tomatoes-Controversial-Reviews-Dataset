Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is another great addition to the Star Wars Saga\\,but it is something different that most fans will be confused with and fall in love eventually.The CGI are amazing as all ways but the thing that threw me off is that they were afraid to kill off some characters to make space for the new ones.In general The Last Jedi will entertain you and it will do it in a differenent\\,fun and suprising way. \\nFINAL VERDICT: 8.5\/10","true":true}
