{"101487":146012,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've read several articles attempting to explain why Last Jedi has a user rating dramatically lower than the critic's score. The general thought is that fans were disappointed because of expectations built-up from Force Awakens or because of ideas of 'what might happen' that ruminated on fan message boards but did not come to fruition. I reject that as the main take away\\, as heartily as I reject the critical consensus. The core issues with Last Jedi are much deeper\\, structural and disheartening:\\n\\n1). This was supposed to be the second movie in a trilogy. A set of movies produced together should have some semblance of a connection to each other. The story should be marching forward\\, building to some grand climax. Last Jedi failed to do this. I remember watching Empire\\, seeing Luke Skywalker's world crushed before him\\, his arm chopped off by his own father. Then there was Lando's betrayal. Han frozen and in the hands of Boba Fett. The stakes felt massively high\\, with only a sliver of hope in sight. Then the credits rolled. To this day\\, it was the biggest\\, most heart wrenching cliffhanger I've ever experienced in cinema. With Last Jedi\\, there is nothing I'm eagerly waiting to be revealed in the final installment. I just don't care. They gave me no reason to.  \\n\\n2. Well written characters should be growing nearer and dearer to viewers with each passing minute and each passing installment of a trilogy - whether antagonist or protagonist. One of the most powerful moments in Return was Darth Vader saving Luke and redeeming himself. Then\\, Luke dragging Vader's hulking body to the shuttle so he wouldn't die on the Death Star II. This was the perfect ending for me\\, because\\, you know\\, I kinda liked how badass Darth Vader was. Right now\\, if the Borg arrived on scene and assimilated every last character of this current trilogy\\, never to be seen again (including BB8)\\, I just wouldn't care. They've given me no reason to. \\n\\n3. Luke Skywalker. There were so many near blasphemous things done\\, I won't try to dissect them all. But what they've done is created such dissonance between who Luke Skywalker was as a character in the original films\\, the brain's only rational response is to discard the storyline of Episode VIII in its entirely. I did very much care about how Luke's existence in the physical universe would come to an end. Clearly\\, they didn't.\\n\\nAnd that's what's disheartening: neither Kathleen Kennedy\\, nor Lucasfilm\\, nor Disney and worse\\, nor the director or screenwriters\\, cared about the legacy of this singular cinematic masterwork. There was \\\"a new hope\\\" that this trilogy would better carry the torch than the Lucas prequels. JJ Abrams managed to carefully accomplish that. But now what we have going forward is apocrypha. Something circulated as truth\\, which is not. Along with the many disappointments of the film\\, add to the list\\, there is not one clever line worth quoting. Not one. I used to complain about that with the prequels. But it is the prequels from which I will address Kathleen Kennedy at the rest of the producers at Lucasfilm: \\n\\n\\\"You were supposed to destroy the Sith\\, not join them. You were supposed to bring balance to the force\\, not leave it in darkness.\\\"","true":true}
