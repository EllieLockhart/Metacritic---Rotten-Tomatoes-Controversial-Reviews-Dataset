Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account to just hate on this movie..I honestly am a HUGE star wars fan I have read some of the books and comics..this is THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! DO NOT SUPPORT DISNEY AND THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE!I DO NOT WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS BAD MOVIE!!","true":true}
