Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOLIER ALERT: Don't read this if you haven't seen. I'm extremely disappointed in this installment of Star Wars as I've just seen it. There are so many things wrong with The Last Jedi and I completely blame the director as The Force Awakens was really\\, really good. The acting (or rather direction) is terrible. Starting the movie with bad humor and jokes is very un-Star Wars like and it continued throughout the film. Luke's character is pathetically bad and some of the new characters should have been left out. Hopefully Disney has learned from it's mistake as they've asked JJ Abrams to direct episode 9 and I really wish he would've done episode 8 as well. I'm giving 2 stars mostly for the visual effects portion of the film.","true":true}
