Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is pretty much crap the script was garbage. The director let his social justice agenda get in the way of making a decent star wars movie. If your a fan and want to watch it just pirate it off the internet don't let Disney get another dime for this crap.","true":true}
