Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was like a 12 year old got several hundred of millions to make a pile of poop.  It was like Hook\\, Jumanji\\, Lord of the Rings\\, and some Star Wars was use as references to make this movie.  It was aweful and the lines were forced.  It's hot garbage and it has ruined me as a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
