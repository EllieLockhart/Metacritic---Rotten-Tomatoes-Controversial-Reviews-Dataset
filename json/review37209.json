Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The opening scene coupled with William's score is what pure movie entertainment is.\\n\\nThe story is jammed packed full of plot and characters which stretched out a little long but was never boring. Snoke was a completely flat character with nothing to add but simple villainy.\\n\\nOverall a joy to watch due in part by the superb cinematography.","true":true}
