Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: So there was approximately 20-30 minutes of irrelevant plot and it was the entire Fin and Rose quest for a codebreaker. Their efforts were for nothing because in the end the admiral (name is escaping me) destroyed the imperial fleet. Also Luke's character direction was disappointing and not something I could see him from Episodes 4-6 doing. Keeping it short\\, it feels like more of a commerical movie than one with a serious plot; it is intended to sell tickets and merchandise because of the Star Wars name.","true":true}
