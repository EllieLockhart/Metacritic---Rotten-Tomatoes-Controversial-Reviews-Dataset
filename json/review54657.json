Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Interesting how high the Tomatometer score is on this latest installment of the SW saga...after giving myself 24 hours to digest it\\, I must say my reaction to it is a big meh. Despite having the same nucleus of pt. 7 that made that film work so well (despite that film's deficiencies)\\, this one blew it on at least a few things. First\\, the cartoonish portrayal of Hux was a let down; second\\, the depiction of Poe was also disappointing (what the hell was with Leia's slap??!). Meanwhile\\, the various subplots with supporting characters were mostly underwhelming. Despite some cool new\/old vehicles and special effects and the generally pleasing interactions between Rey and Kylo\\, the film is a big disappointment--this coming\\, if I must say\\, from a diehard SW fan as a kid--that smacks as little more than one cash-grab for another (i.e.\\, episode 9). While I was generally satisfied with Luke's portrayal\\, I was a bit let down with his death (though my 8-year-old son was fine with it). Overall\\, the filmmakers wimped out on this one and could have blown us away; instead\\, they've gotta make more money and sell more tickets.","true":true}
