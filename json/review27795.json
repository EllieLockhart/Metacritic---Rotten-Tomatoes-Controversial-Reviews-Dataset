Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps it is simply enough to say that Star Wars movies are an event in themselves and although the Last Jedi doesn't reach the heights of The Force Awakens- it is a great piece and will sit well with the other movies in the cannon. Although the narrative is weak and there is some padding it can be excused as it usually is the case with middle films of a trilogy. What the Last Jedi has going for it are some fantastic standalone sequences\\, sequences which are classic trademark Star Wars\\, and all fans- old and new should enjoy them. (Reminiscent of classic Star Wars- an enjoyable ride)","true":true}
