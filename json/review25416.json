Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Non-Spoiler Review: This installment of the Star Wars Saga has fans divided. The problem is\\, it's for the wrong reasons. Fans complained when TFA was too much like ANH. Now that TLJ is different and completely unpredictable\\, they're crying it's not like ESB. It's not perfect\\, but it takes Star Wars into new places and in a direction I didn't see coming. Ep IX will certainly be interesting. I suggest going through some old EU books and comics to explore some things that were incorporated into the film. I also suggest seeing it more than once. Your initial viewing will be skewed by your excitement and worry.","true":true}
