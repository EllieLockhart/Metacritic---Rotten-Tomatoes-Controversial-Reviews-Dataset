Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the Star Wars saga continues\\,this movie depicts a unique transitioning of the overall plot as heroic battles unfold. However this movie fails to stress the major themes throughout the movie and also in the saga itself for example- the bond between Leia and Luke that have been massively understated due to all her efforts of finding her brother only builds up to only one scene where they reunite which is followed by the duel between Luke and Kylo .The second flaw of this movie is that most characters such as DJ and Snoke have very scarce influence in the movie itself whereas being important plot characters\\, they needed further development in order to improve the flow of all character's purpose\\,importance and role instead of just helping the main characters to further their story and just disappear. On my opinion\\, Snoke could have been a greater character if he was deeply emphasized on his abilities and connection with the Dark Side along with the foretelling of his background or origins.","true":true}
