Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like a whole new thing. It seems strained\\, forced. It is not a smooth transition from legend to the present. Average plot\\, screenplay\\, character development and cast. All of the above could be excused if the later releases show that\\, logically and ingeniously\\, episodes VII and VIII were only the first bricks\\, the tip of the iceberg.","true":true}
