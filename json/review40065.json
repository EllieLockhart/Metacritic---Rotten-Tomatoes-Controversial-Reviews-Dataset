Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my second favorite Star Wars behind Empire Strikes Back... I like the direction they are taking the Star Wars mythology.... I know a lot of fans wanted to see more Luke and the training of Rey\\, but when we saw Luke being trained by Obi-Wan & Yoda there was not much training there. So i dont get all the complaining. The movie like all movies has it flaws but they were  small. Over all it was a great movie. Will see it multiples time.","true":true}
