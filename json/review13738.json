Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it were possible to give this film no stars I would.  Legitimately one of the worst films i've ever watched.  The fact that 91% of critics gave this a positive review is the clearest sign that critics are available for purchase.  I'm sure disney will be happy they can sell their shitty little furby rip offs though.  Terrible acting\\, horrendous plot\\, little to no character development.  Crystal scull was a better addition to the indiana jones series than this was to star wars.  can't believe the extended universe was scrapped for this garbage.","true":true}
