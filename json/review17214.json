Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved the movie.\\n\\nThey took risks and they worked amazing for me\\, also a good set up for the final movie.\\n\\nThe story was good\\, the CGI and the places so good. \\n\\nWhat an awesome time for been a Star Wars fan!","true":true}
