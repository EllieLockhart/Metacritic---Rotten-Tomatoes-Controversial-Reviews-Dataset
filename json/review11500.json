Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie\\, the new combat system for lightsaber battles tries to make material movement of the blade the strategy and completely ignores the force being used to guide the blade to the amazing affects we are used to seeing.  The new combat system is awefu\\, period.\\n\\nFurthermore\\, everyone in the movie is basically pointless and all their actions the same and nothing makese sense.   The political grand standing is so obvious that I won't add it to my review becuase it is blatantly obvious what message they are pushing.\\n\\nRey is a HORRIBLE lead character\\, I literally hate her.  They made Luke look like a ridiculous shell of what he once was and all the bad guys look like children\\, how the hell could they get to where they are being so incredibly stupid?\\n\\nLast and possibly most important tome was the scope.   The battles consist of 10 fighters taking on 3 capital ships\\, or 7 walkers taking on one door.\\n\\nThere are other governments in the galaxy\\, the Mandalors for example would wipe the floor with the First Order AND the New Republic at this pathetic state of the galaxy.\\n\\nThey turned this series which I have put so much incredibly time in my life to and just completely went a different way.  I guess I can respect that and if you like the movie\\, congrats and more power to you.\\n\\nI am very frustrated and sad\\, lowest rating possible to show that an old Star Wars obsessed nut is not happy with the direction they are taking the cannon.  \\n\\nWill I go see the next episode in theatres?  Probably ... maybe.  But have I ever even GUESSED at \\\"would I see a Star Wars moie in theaters\\\" before this?  God no...\\n\\nThe real test will be to see how the next movie does.\\n\\nI may be waiting until ilt comes out on HBO","true":true}
