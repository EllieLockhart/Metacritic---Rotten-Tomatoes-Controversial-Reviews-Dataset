Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, I just made this account to review this movie. When critics appreciate only the \\\"diverse\\, strong female leads\\, bla bla\\\" and totally disregards what a craptastic experience this movie is\\, you have to do something. I enjoyed the cinematics but the story and editing of the movie was god damned awful. I just want my money back\\, I don't want to support with my wallet this kind of disrespect to viewers.","true":true}
