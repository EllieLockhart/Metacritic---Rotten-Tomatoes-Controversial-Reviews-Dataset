Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie met all my expectations and then some! I don't understand how you couldn't love this as a Star Wars fan. I can't say much more because I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. I loved every character and every part they played in the movie. Definitely not a retread of Empire Strikes Back as many feared.","true":true}
