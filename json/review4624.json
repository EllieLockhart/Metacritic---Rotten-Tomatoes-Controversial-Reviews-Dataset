Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Coming from a 40 year-old die-hard Star Wars fan\\, this film tears down or ignores every single question and destroys every hope that was set up in The Force Awakens. I left the theatre immensely disappointed. Terrible Story. I have to say it's the worst Star Wars film ever. Worse than the prequels. What a letdown.","true":true}
