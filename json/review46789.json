Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, I did not love this movie as much as many critics...and I did not hate this movie as much as many fans. There were moments that really worked: conversations between powerful Jedi\\, epic battles with light sabers\\, and - even more - plot misdirections that kept you guessing. Basically\\, there were some cool risks that paid off. But in between the humor felt forced and the twists seemed WAY too convenient. Long story short: there was a movie in there I liked (the one starring Rey) and a movie in there I disliked (the one starring Finn).","true":true}
