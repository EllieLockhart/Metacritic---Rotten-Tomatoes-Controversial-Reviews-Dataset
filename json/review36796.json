Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie starts with misplaced MCU humor on the first scene\\, then just disregards every new thing introduced in TFA\\, and lastly just feels like an emotionless movie with generic messages and action pieces. This would pass as an animated children movie\\, didn't work for me at all. Also it shows that there is no major arcing plan for this trilogy and they are winging it. Will not see ep 9 in the cinemas after this.","true":true}
