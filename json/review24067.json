Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mary Poppins Leia\\, barely 3 days of training Rey can take out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker in a lightsabre fight\\, purple hair Laura Dern withholding information from her crew so they mutiny on her\\, the list goes on.  I'm not even a die hard Star Wars fan\\, this was just horrible.  Not going to bother watching the next one.  They aren't getting any more of my money.","true":true}
