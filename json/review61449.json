I found myself loving the exploration and actually getting annoyed when combat \u201cgot in the way\u201d. I think the story is pretty interesting as a theme but the character kind of fail to grab my attention. I really like being conflicted and finding myself loathing the presumed protagonist but at the same time a lot of the choices that the protagonist does doesn\u2019t really feel in character\/plausible. When taking a step back and looking at this from a broader perspective\\, comparing it to all games and not just it\u2019s prequel\\, it\u2019s still a great game. Graphics\\, audio\\, animation and voice acting is god tier. The narrative and character development\\, though weaker than the first game\\, is also high class. As far as controversies regarding the game go I\u2019d say: just play the game. The game does not do what it\u2019s accused of. It does not push any agenda down your throat. It doesn\u2019t fail in its story telling due to taking a political stance. Sure it\u2019s not as good as the first game but it\u2019s not due to anything related to the \u201ccontroversy\u201d. I think the game would have felt like a better experience if they skipped some acts\/story beats and focused more on the driving factors of the main protagonist. It was also too long: the naughty dog gameplay loop is not fun and\/or varied enough to last for 25 hours.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
