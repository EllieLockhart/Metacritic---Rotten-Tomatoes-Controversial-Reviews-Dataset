Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Atrocious . Marvel-esque humor and terrible pacing.  The Finn Rose storyline was useless and almost made me walk out of the theater.  This is NOT a Star Wars movie.  Would not be surprised if we see some Marvel Star Wars collaboration the way they treat this series now.  Thanks for finally killing star wars.","true":true}
