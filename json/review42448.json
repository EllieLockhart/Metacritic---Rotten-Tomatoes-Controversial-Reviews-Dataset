Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a dumpster fire. So many plot holes and ex machinas. (Spoiler).\\n\\nSo many folks are mad because of the whole casino planet side quest\\, because they say that is was pointless. That if we took the whole side plot out that the movie would have pretty much been the same. Ummm... NO. More than likely\\, the resistance would not have had over half their folks killed off\\, because there would have never been a Benicio Del \\\"turncoat\\\" around to give up their plans. I mean\\, that general refusing to tell anyone her plan may end up as the single worst war strategy move in film history.","true":true}
