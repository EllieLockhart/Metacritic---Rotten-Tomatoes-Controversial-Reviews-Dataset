Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HORRENDOUS!!  It's almost as if somebody dared Rian Johnson to make the worst movie of the decade just to see if he could.  And he did.\\n\\nTerrible new characters in Rose and purple.  Bad jokes.  Unoriginal dialogue.  Plot holes galore.  Luke milking teats.  Rey is a Mary sue.","true":true}
