Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No. I didn't wait two years for 18 hours to pass in the Star Wars Universe. This movie is full of cliche nonsense and introduces a bunch of crap that is clearly meant to be good toy material to market to children. Rey is still a mary sue\\, probably worse so now. Basically every possibly interesting character is defeated with no fight at all. \\n\\nIt took them two years to make BB-8 worse than Jar Jar.\\n\\nI'm done with Star Wars after this.","true":true}
