Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it certainly takes the more risks than the previous seven films combined\\, most of them (if not all) pay off\\, resulting in a story rich in drama\\, action (propelled mostly by its state-of-the-art special effects) and comedy\\, more politically charged than ever and more morally complex than any other product from the Disney world. Moreover\\, the old cast never fails and the new characters grow increasingly likeable\\, especially Kylo Ren (thanks mostly to Adam Driver's outstanding performance). For these reasons\\, \\\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\\\" is both a highly successful reinvention that still retains much of the saga's epicness and essence\\, as well as one of the best films of 2017.","true":true}
