Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this website doesn't factor 0 stars or 1\/2  star reviews...... so the actual audience scored factored from samples is 24% not 57.....not 40     24%\\n\\nthe movie was total rubbish","true":true}
