The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I didn\u2019t enjoy the game at all. It completely burned the original\\, but i find it beautiful in a way. It was heart aching and shoved the idea that revenge is bad. But the reason why I give it a ten is how effective the game is to display the tragedy of Ellie. The game takes a character you love so much and destroy it\\, illustrating the flaws everyone has. I know many people may argue against me but if found this meaning in the game. This game is not like the first one\\, rather it pushes the boundaries of games becoming art. The developers don\u2019t want you to have fun. Therefore\\, they strip every character that Ellie cares about and allow their deaths to be so pointless that her fight for revenge becomes pointless in itself. Joel died in such a stupid way because it is a parallel to Ellie\u2019s need to die in a meaningful way as it would allow her life to have meaning. Hence when Joel stripped her ability to save humanity in the first game\\, Ellie lost her relationship with Joel because of that. Hence when Joel dies such a stupid and pointless death\\, Ellie fights for revenge for some catharsis. Her nightmares forcing her to kill Abby and then in the final climax she realising killing Abby won\u2019t do anything\\, but rather her inability to forgive Joel for saving her and always trying to help her is why she is always tormented by Joel\u2019s death. Thus realising that life doesn\u2019t have to have any meaning and people die meaningless or pointless deaths. It\u2019s an acceptance of living a life with satisfaction and around the people who care about you. It\u2019s a growth in maturity for Ellie. It\u2019s a brilliant tragedy of an acceptance of a harsh reality. The entire fight to Seattle and then Santa Barbara is so tiring and pointless to play because there is no meaning at all to have such a fight. That\u2019s exactly what the developers want you to feel\\, that annoyance. It isn\u2019t an enjoyable game like the first one\\, but that\u2019s what drives the narrative and expressive intent by the creators. That\u2019s why in the final scene inside of Ellie all along it\u2019s the regret to not apologise Joel thy gives her the reason to her torment. Games can be art...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
