Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just when I thought they couldn\u2019t ruin this franchise even more they did. This movie had no real plot. I was confused the whole time trying to figure out where it was going. No structure whatsoever. It didn\u2019t feel like a Star Wars movie at all. They turned the Jedi master Luke skywalks into a Emo cry baby. \u201cSith lord snook\u201d died like he was nothing. May I add they didn\u2019t even explain who he was or where he came from. Poor actions scenes. Pointless casino rescue adventure with two characters that had no value or purpose to the mission. To top it al off just when you think there will be an epic lightsaber duel you find out that it\u2019s nothing more Than a tease. Hate hate hate what they\u2019ve done to such an amazing saga. As far as I\u2019m concerned these are not cannon. The Star Wars trilogy ended when George Lucus sold the rights to Disney. Return of the Jedi is and will forever be the ending to an unforgettable trilogy. ","true":true}
