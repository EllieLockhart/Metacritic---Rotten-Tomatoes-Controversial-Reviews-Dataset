Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3\/10 The prequel trilogy had rough effects\\, poor acting and cliche dialogue\\, yet the seeds of an epic story. This was the inverse. Visuals were amazing\\, acting was on point\\, but the story bends over backwards for political messaging and often times does make sense of or explain what is happening. Characters look the part on the outside\\, yet I couldn't care less what becomes of them or this trilogy.","true":true}
