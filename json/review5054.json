Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to post this. This is the WORST star wars I've ever seen. This is worse than Episode 1-3. \\n\\nI would\\, quite honestly\\, have preferred to watch an origin story of Jar Jar Binks than this. Get your shit together Disney.","true":true}
