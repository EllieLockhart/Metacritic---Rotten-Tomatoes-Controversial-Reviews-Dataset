Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t pay attention to all the low ratings by others. Some people just take the wrong things in life waaaayyyyy too seriously. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that I\u2019m not trying to relive my childhood that I\u2019m able to enjoy these new installments so much. A very good movie. Jaw dropping moments. Funny dialogue reminiscent of A New Hope and ESB. Perfect? No. But perfectly entertaining. And I\u2019ve been a fan since the beginning.","true":true}
