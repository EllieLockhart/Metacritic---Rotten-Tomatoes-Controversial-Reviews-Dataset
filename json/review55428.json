Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive plot holes\\, ruined many characters and was an absolute disgrace to star wars fans. I intend to ignore this movie as proper lore... I have never hated a star wars movie until now.. The only positive aspect of this movie is the amazing imagery and beautiful scenes with a perfect blend of CGI and reality that can only be compared to the recent Blade Runner movie.. this doesn't make up for the terrible plot however and is completely obvious that directors were changed midway through this trilogy which was Disney's worst idea ever for the franchise.. I doubt the 9th movie can redeem this horrible thrown together movie..","true":true}
