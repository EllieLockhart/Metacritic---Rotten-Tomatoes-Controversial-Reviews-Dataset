{"101487":175359,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is dithering\\, boring and way too long for how little actual story it contains. The plot achieves only one thing of significance: being absolutely all-over-the-place and yet managing to go nowhere at all. Every single question is explained with coincidences that strain even an invested fan's suspension of disbelief\\, or the not-so-subtle implication that we should all just grow up and get out of Disney's postmodernist way. They seem to be celebrating the notion that some things can simply have no (worthwhile) explanation (Rey's parentage and backstory)\\, and are rebelling in the realization you can surprise people by \\\"subverting expectations\\\"\\, which is short for random-story-generation\\, with well established characters acting arbitrarily and contrary to their motivations. They've managed to make it hard to care about any of the characters\\, which I guess makes it easier when they kill off as many of the originals as they can manage\\, to clear the slate for new toys.\\n\\nWhile The Force Awakens was derivative\\, messy\\, lazily written\\, at least it looked good. This one MOSTLY does\\, unless you look a little closer. The space battle (that's right\\, there's only the one\\, and it goes on for the whole movie) is not bad\\, because it's distant CGI and explosions - hard to mess that up\\, just spray greebles on your ships and you're good (at least that seems to be how they're treating the new star destroyers). But when it comes to anything a little finer detail\\, it all falls apart. Everything just looks a little too fake\\, and anything that's meant to be spectacular and dramatic comes off as cheap and poorly rendered. The inclusion of puppets for Yoda\\, the caretakers and the porgs really only serves to demonstrate that Lucasfilm's animatronics and puppetry have not advanced since The Return of the Jedi came out. Weird.\\n\\nThey have made the absolute minimum effort to make us care about any of the new characters\\, while going out of their way to ruin any enjoyment that might yet be squeezed out of the old ones. The politics and factions make zero sense\\, and they're basically just showing that the whole galaxy is run by evil rich white dudes who are way too busy playing space-poker to be a worthwile part of this movie's rambling plot. This was a cynical\\, off-note move to try to \\\"deconstruct\\\" and tarnish the stories that have come before\\, in order to open things up for a much lesser story\\, with much weaker characters to come. They've disguised it by vaguely aligning (in three most superficial sense) with current politics\\, so that we might all praise them for all their wonderful equality\\, but it comes off as a lazy\\, confused circus.\\n\\nI miss when Star Wars was about actually doing something new\\, exploring exciting new ideas. For all the talk of Rian Johnson's revolutionary genius\\, all I see here is a low-effort remix of overused Star Wars archetypes\\, with more than a sprinkling of poorly developed new characters to make it seem like something new.","true":true}
