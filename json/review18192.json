Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it wasn't for fantastic! Loved the performances\\, such phenomenal actors! The characters were multilayered and there were plenty of twists I did NOT see coming and ive a fan since seeing the original trilogy as a kid. I loved the sets and story\\, the dynamic between Rey and Kylo wasn't so interesting that was honestly my favorite part\\, and seeing Finn and Poe get more involved storylines was great. The new characters were also interesting and I was delightfully surprised by the laughs that were in the film as well.","true":true}
