Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's interesting rating this after reading the some of the negative reviews. Is it perfect? No. Are any movies perfect? No. I go to a movie hoping to be suckered into a story line and entertained. The Last Jedi does this easily. It is every bit as good and better than most of it's predecessors. It has humor\\, like it's predecessors\\, tension\\, peril\\, twists and turns\\, ups and downs. It continues to follow the Episode 4\\, 5 and 6 formula aside from a few story line differences. If you hate this movie is to say you hated Empire and Jedi both. I guess I was fortunate to go in with the only expectation to continue the storyline and be entertained. I got just that and I enjoyed it immensely. Going back to see it again!","true":true}
