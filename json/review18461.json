Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is just mindblowing how feminists are all thrilled by the fact that the protagonist of this movie is a woman. They do not even notice that Daisy Ridley has been casted to play the female hero only because she has very small tits and hips\\, so that they can completely hide her femininity and have her look just like a man. Hair always tied up. No makeup. Every erogenous zone is covered. A completely chastized\\, de-feminized\\, de-sexualized character. Is she still a woman? Do you relate to her? Do you want her as your role model?\\nWhat's the message here for all women? If you want success\\, dress like a man\\, act like a man\\, be a man. They could also have added a hijab and feminists would have hailed the new female hero nonetheless!\\nYou are really fucked up\\, sisters.","true":true}
