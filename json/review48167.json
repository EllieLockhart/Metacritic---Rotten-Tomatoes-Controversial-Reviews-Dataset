Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While understanding how this movie has changed much of what we thought of from the original trilogy concerning the Jedi and how Star Wars movies \\\"should be\\\"\\, I completely disagree with others who say this movie is the worst. The Last Jedi created the perfect villain in Kylo Ren\\, one who is sociopathic and power obsessed. Rey is a hero much like Luke was in the original trilogy\\, naturally strong in the force and in her own moral compass. Luke's character arc is justified and shows a man who has lost faith in himself\\, his religion and is fearful to do it all again. This movie perfectly sets up the final instalment to be about the new characters (because let's face it\\, this trilogy was never a rehash of the original 3\\, it was never supposed to be a second run for Luke\\, Leia and Han)\\, There was darkness\\, there was plot twists\\, there was humour and I loved every minute of it.","true":true}
