This game looks even better than Uncharted 4 somehow. The fact that they could do this much on 6 year old hardware is incredible\\, and the dev team deserves all the commendation in the world for their feat. The game play is similarly fantastic\\, and I enjoy the slitting of throats and destruction of femurs with shotgun shells more than I'd care to admit.\r\rHowever\\, neither of these are the controversial aspect of the game. The narrative direction has pissed a lot of people off\\, to say the least. Some are justified\\, but most of the negative reviews you see here are something along the lines of \\\"they don't respect the characters.\\\" I can't really elaborate further without spoilers. Personally\\, I loved the way the plot progressed\\, because it felt like I was in the pages of a gripping novel\\, the kind that you can't put down. That's the best way to think about this game\\, as a novel. Tension ratchets up and simmers off and ratchets up again. It's messy\\, the objective you start out with is never achieved. It's frustrating. In that way\\, I think it emulates real life far better than the first game\\, which is decidedly more movie-like. If you don't like reading\\, you're probably going to struggle with this story. It isn't for everyone.\r\rThis game has grown on me in the weeks since completion\\, and I have a great respect for Naughty Dog pushing the bounds of storytelling in video games. There are issues that I have with the game; enough to knock it down to a nine in fact. However\\, if you own a PS4\\, do yourself a favor and buy this wonderful mess.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
