Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was amazing. From the most emotional moments to the most breathtaking events. I believe it's as good as Empire Strikes Back and Revenge of the Sith. I can't wait to see what the future will be for Star Wars.","true":true}
