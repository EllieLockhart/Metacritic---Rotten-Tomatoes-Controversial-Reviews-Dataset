Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A daring attempt to bring lots of new and exciting views into the starwars universe: the indifference to good evil and humanity of the military industrial complex\\, the role and difficulties of women in leadership\\, how sometimes problems are bigger and can't be solved by the actions of a few chosen heroes\\, and more. Unfortunately they were only able to accomplish them by dumbing down characters and washing out motivations and arcs\\, causing the story and the messages they wanted to convey to suffer greatly. Beautiful visuals display the budget\\, but overall not worth a watch.","true":true}
