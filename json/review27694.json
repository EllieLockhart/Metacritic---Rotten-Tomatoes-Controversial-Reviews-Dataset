Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People always assume that the original movie\/s in any series will be the best\\, but not in this case. Star Wars the Last Jedi is definitely one of my favourites. The acting is outstanding and the story gives me chills because it's so amazing. Absolutely loved this movie!","true":true}
