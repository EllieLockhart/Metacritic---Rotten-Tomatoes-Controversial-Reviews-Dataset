Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high expectations\\,  and no BS\\, I wanted to walk out half way through this mess and I was longing for the end credits by the end of it.  What a mess! We waited 34 years to see the return of Luke in all of his badassdom\\, instead we got Luke the loser.  Childish and purile jokes at the wrong moments\\, and a weak as water plot. The prequels destroyed the legacy of Darth Vader. They are now out to destroy what was left of Star Wars. Sadly\\, this film fails miserably.","true":true}
