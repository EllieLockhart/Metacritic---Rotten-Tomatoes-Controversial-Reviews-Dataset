Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"impressive cinematography\\, impressive effects\\, but the script is also impressively all over the place and lazy\\, I lost concentration several times because the characters are just not interesting. I had to keep dropping my expectation just to finish the film\\, but never got me on board\\, ended in disappointment. \\nit's like a lot of nice trailers pieced together abruptly\\, I wouldn't say it's a good movie regardless of the franchise.  \\n\\nLooking forward to the next one\\, hope it would be much better.","true":true}
