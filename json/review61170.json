Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"SPOILER AHEAD:............Honeslty the story was just stupid.I tried to love it from the start but just couldn't in the end.Once you finish the game you realise you literally wasted your entire time.Stupid decision to make Abby a playable character for half the game.Would have been sooooooo much better if the first 10% of the game was Joel & Ellie roaming around.Pre much the tutorial.Have Ellie found out about the secret Joel had about her & then have Joel get kidnapped by Abby & her group.The whole purpose of the game should be Ellie finding Joel & having her mad at him for what he did.Debating if she even wants to find him.When she finally does find him he could be missing a hand & have an eyeball ripped out.So you've seen him proper tortured.She can then be held down in front of him.She then locks eyes with him & says \\\"I forgive you\\\".Then bam.Joel gets hit in the head.The screen goes black.Credits rolls.After the credits it shows Ellie with massive anger & vengeance in her eyes.You then hear.\\\"I'm gonna **** kill you\\\".Then you just see on the screen something to do with the The Last of Part III.Would be a great game & make you really keen for the third chapter.Oh well though.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
