Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is the matter with you people not liking SW: TLJ?  Rian Johnson took the franchise in a much needed new direction.  Characters make surprising decisions and add some fresh story alternatives to the ones you made up in your head.  Just because the movie didn't do all the things you made up in your imagination doesn't mean it's bad.  It's just different than you wanted.  Are there a few issues with the film?  Sure as there are issues with every film but certainly not the fatal flaws some apparently think there are.  I can't wait to see Ep. IX from JJ and the new trilogy to be  helmed by Johnson.  All the complainers need to return to their parent's basement and stare loving at their unopened blister packs of original trilogy action figures.","true":true}
