We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A very ambitious piece of work from one of the best companies in the gaming business.\r\rIt takes gameplay elements from the first game\\, adds some of Uncharted 4's flair and raises them both to a new level of realistic movement and combat.\rThe motion capture\\, voice acting\\, audio and scripted action  are exactly what you've come to expect from a Naughty Dog title.\r\rGraphics are up there with the best of this generation. Weather elements are particularly well done and really help realise the hostile atmosphere they were going for. Enemy's are highly detailed and this makes the combat even more brutal than the first game.\r\rThe story seems to have divided opinion but on closer inspection\\, this is clearly salty gamers who haven't played the game\\, but read the spoilers and are trying to make their 0 star review seem realistic. On top of this you have the homo-phobic\\, trans-phobic community desperately trying to make this game fail for having a muscular woman and a gay woman as the playable characters.\r\rThere is absolutely no same minded person who would play this and give it a 0\\, especially if as they say\\, the story is the only part they hated. Just like any sane fan of the first game knows Joel wasn't a hero. Even if you genuinely hated the story twists\\, the other aspects of the game would make it at least a 6\/10. But that doesn't drag the score down enough - so 0 star reviews it is!\r\rMy personal take on the story -  I feel like the message would have worked better if Ellie had gone through with the killing.\rShe'd still have lost her fingers and with it her last link to Joel - thus showing her that revenge won't change the past and she lost everything she still had chasing it.\r\rI also felt it was a genius twist to force us to pay as the antagonist. Seeing things from her perspective\\, learning about her own good and bad traits\\, and her motivation for wanting to find and murder Joel.\rWe also see Abby once again rescued by a sworn enemy\\, but instead this time she vows to help them in any way possible. Clearly showing that her thirst for revenge has left her questioning her own moral choices and needing to redeem herself with a selfless act.\r\rThis even caused some players to end up rooting for Abby by the end. Clearly not the terrible story line some try and pretend it is.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
