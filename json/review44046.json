Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ finally pushes the Star Wars story forward. It's literally the first movie in 30 years that's looking to the future of the series instead of rehashing the past. \\n\\nAnd just because your convoluted Snoke theory didn't pan out\\, doesn't mean the movie sucked. And giving an iconic character a more complicated and dynamic arc isn't betraying his legacy\\, it's making it better. \\n\\nOnly complaint is the Finn storyline which is kinda shoehorned in just to give him something to do. Hopefully he's given something more consequential in IX.","true":true}
