Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rhian Johnson threw in the kitchen sink. Let's see how many plot lines\\, characters and scenes we can throw in. Characters blah. Humour OTT. Some fun bits\\, but poor Luke's character got decimated. Will watch again for details but TFA better and Rogue One WAY BETTER. And what the heck was up with Leia as Superman?!?!","true":true}
