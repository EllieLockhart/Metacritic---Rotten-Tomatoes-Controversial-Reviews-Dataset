Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am very surprised anyone would give this a bad review.  I saw it opening night (12\/14\/2017).  I was impressed with how well written this is.  There were some surprises and I liked how well thought out it was.\\n\\nThe only negative is the movie is too long at 2 hours 30 mins.  Also\\, I found it odd there were no light saber battles the first 2 hours\\, then the last 30 mins there's a ton of light saber battles.  Definately don't leave to use the bathroom at the end.\\n\\nOverall I would say this is one of the best Star Wars movies.  Better than Rogue One.  Maybe better than the originals.","true":true}
