Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know\\, just couldn't get into this film\\, I guess that last half of the film was Badass... But the intro was a bore... couldnt of been better... not my favorite film of the year sadly","true":true}
