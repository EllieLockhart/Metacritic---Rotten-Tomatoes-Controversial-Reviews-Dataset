Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Saga and its characters\\, especially Skywalker\\, have been destroyed by this bad movie. I will not watch any further SW-movie and I am afraid that I can hardly stand watching any old episode ever again.","true":true}
