Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie actually created a character more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks!\\nActually\\, TWO characters: Rose and General Purple Hair!\\n\\nHonestly\\, I'd sooner watch a whole movie about Jar Jar than ever have to see Rose's face again. She is the most irritating\\, smug\\, preachy\\, self-righteous and pointless character ever created in a Star Wars film.","true":true}
