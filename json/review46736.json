Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"welcome to america\\, where even movie reviews are rigged.  need proof?  i went abroad\\, and apparently the non english language critics have not been paid off or bullied by disney\\, because 100% of the spanish language reviews said the movie was BAD\\, which it obviously is.  i didn't realize that disney has resorted to gaslighting a nation.  wow.  they are the new empire\\, not the first order.","true":true}
