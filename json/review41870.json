Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the death of Star Wars for me. I am a huge Star Wars fan. Played every video game. Bought toys. Watched every movie multiple times. And this garbage is what Disney decided to puke out. It absolutely destroys the characters that you know and love. Luke is reduced to a pathetic hobo. And it is so out-of-character for him. This whole movie is about Disney trying to shove out the old characters that we all loved to make way for their \\\"new\\\" vision. Seriously\\, this movie made me so mad\\, that I will never watch another Star Wars movie again. I cannot believe that it happened. I have my original trilogy. I guess that is as good as it will get.","true":true}
