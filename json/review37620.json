Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is on thing you must take from this movie in order for you to love it. \\\"Let the Past Die. Kill it\\, if you have to.\\\" This is a line from this movie but also a message to the fans of this beloved franchise. This movie is different from the one's in the past. It's somewhat bends the rules of the force as we know it. It takes characters on rides that most were not expecting. I for one am glad it did. The Force Awakens brought Star Wars back and The Last Jedi moved Star Wars forward and I for one am excited for the future.","true":true}
