Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I am not sure where to begin with this title\\, but I will say this: TLOU was an amazing\\, heart-felt\\, beautifully crafted and written game. Seven years later\\, this pile gets dumped on us. In an effort to be as fair as I can\\, the visuals\\, animations\\, voice acting\\, and world are amazingly well done. But...that's not why I wanted to play this game. The gameplay is stale - it does little to iterate or improve on a legacy system (PS3) on the next-generation console (PS4).\r\rThe main characters that I loved so much didn't even seem the same. Joel doesn't act like Joel\\, Ellie doesn't act like Ellie\\, and ham-handed new characters that also don't make much sense. The story is shoved down your throat\\, there is no choice involved\\, and - lest we call forget - revenge is bad. Unless you're a character named Abby who has cake and eats it too.\r\rOh\\, and you play multiple hours as a ho-hum character that I just couldn't bring myself to give a crap about. The depth of character from the first game is starkly missing.\r\rNot worth the buy. 3\/10 because its sound\\, acting\\, and visuals were amazing. Aside from that? Eh\\, if you're curious\\, watch a VOD of gameplay on YT or your favorite streaming platform.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
