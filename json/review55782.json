Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps an endless stream of mindless comic book-based action movies  has finally reduced the average American viewer's attention span and critical thinking to a smoldering hunk of poodoo.  This installment of Star Wars meandered through a series of mindless battles\\, explosions\\, and last minute \\\"save the day\\\" maneuvers.  Characters that held promise were killed off (easily\\, I might add) and weak characters that we do not care about (Rose\\, for instance) take up too much of the plot.  Can we also talk about Leia flying through space with no body suit?  Seriously\\, she would have been frozen solid in a heartbeat.  I hate to nit-pick details like this\\, but literally every science fiction fan understands that space is really f'ing cold and will kill you instantly if you aren't protected.  Let's not even begin with the effects of solar radiation.  I found myself rolling my eyes and shaking my head more than I could count.  This movie took 2D characters and made them 1D.  If you like mindless comic book movies\\, then I guess\\, like most of America\\, you'll love this.  For anyone hoping for brilliant writing\\, interesting plot twists\\, and exciting turns in the Star Wars saga\\, you'll find yourself wanting for more when you shuffle out of the theater.","true":true}
