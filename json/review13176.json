Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't really understand the uproar from the audience over this movie. I understand people may feel that there was a lot left to be desired by questions that were answered\/left unanswered from The Force Awakens\\, but a 56% people! C'mon\\, that's ridiculous! I personally loved the movie\\, but it did have some flaws\\, thus the 4\/5 stars. Somehow\\, I get the feeling JJ Abrams is setting up for something bigger in Episode IX (and yes\\, I know Rian Johnson wrote the story\\, but Abrams has a higher story arc Johnson followed. I'm sure of that).","true":true}
