Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not big into the Star Wars universe but this wasn't just a horrible Star Wars movie\\, this was an objectively bad film. Overall it was boring\\, the acting was distractingly bad\\, there were plot holes galore\\, and they littered the film with cringe worthy attempts at humor. I loved Rogue One\\, but this was a pile of garbage. So bad that I refuse to pay Disney money to see any future films in this franchise. \\n\\nCritics that reviewed this movie positively were likely either bribed\\, scared that they would be blacklisted from screening future Disney films for an honest review\\, or enjoy the occasional hit from the ol' crack pipe.","true":true}
