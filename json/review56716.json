Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had great potential. The makers inherited a huge and complex Universe\\, a saga to build upon\\, and a base of fans unrivalled in any franchise. That\\, and mysteries and interesting characters from previous movies\\, episode VII included.\\n\\nThen\\, they proceeded by taking a dump on everything. Lazy and irrelevent plot-lines aside\\, ridicilous character development\\, and no logic what-so-ever for the technical stuff. Plenty of posts have delved into that. Forget the old mysteries...nothing mattered.\\n\\nIt has ruined my Star Wars experience...I hope Disney ends up losing profits long-term\\, while in the short-term they will live off the name and expectations as a \\\"must-see movie\\\" For my part I will never buy a Star Wars comic\\, apparell or book again. Just can't stomach what they did with the saga.\\n\\nPS! How many critics are in Disney's pockets? Or are they just a flock of sheep that can't make out their own opinions seperate from the flock of baying sheep?\\n\\nThe critics and other will blame alt.right\\, that people could not handle strong female characters\\, political message blah blah blah. Ridicilous\\, it was just a crap movie. \\\"Burn it all down...and replace it with something new.\\\" Well\\, the \\\"new\\\" is old\\, worn-out and not really interesting. People came to see Star Wars\\, not this poor excuse. The \\\"reset\\\" just makes into another generic blocbuster\\, that participates in the general dumbing down of the world and society in general. I hope Disney rots....would have been better to never make another movie than being served this.","true":true}
