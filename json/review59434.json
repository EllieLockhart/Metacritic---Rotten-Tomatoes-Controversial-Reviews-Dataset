This goes to show how bad naughty dog did on tlou2. No one cares about LGBTNo one cares about Abby No one cares about the society irl Most people play games to have a break from real life and dive into an adventure that upon finish they can smile and remember for the good part of their youth and or life. Right off the bat agendas seem obvious when ellie kinda felt uncomfortable. Then Abs is what abs is. Then lev\/lily omg give me a break. Lily\/lev s storyline.. Why?? Everyone I cared about in this game died and everyone I wanted dead stayed alive. FfsKilling Joel killed the game for me. Even though Joel wasn't the Joel from the first part. Not killing Abby is the icing on the cake. Ellie is not the ellie I know. Ellie going crazy is where I'm starting to rethink why on earth did I even go along with this **** after what happened in Jacksonville.If u waited for seven years to get the same or better experience\\, find another game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
