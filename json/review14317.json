{"101487":133199,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up watching Star Wars\\, my brother and I would watch the original trilogy almost every week when we were kids. I had all the toys\\, I made all the Star Wars legos. The Star Wars movies became something that felt near and dear to me and kind of felt like it was part of my family. When these new movies and the sequel trilogy started coming out I felt like I became even more of a die-hard fan\\, like I was a kid again playing with my brother and going to see this awesome story of the ultimate good vs the ultimate evil. And I loved the feeling that The Force Awakens and these new movies were bringing back to the franchise; I was overwhelmed after seeing The Force Awakens for the first time\\, like it was the movie I had been waiting for so long to finally see. Then I went into The Last Jedi also expecting to see this Star Wars movie that I felt like I had been waiting almost my entire life to finally see. And yet\\, as much as I want to love this movie\\, I just can't. I understand all of the criticisms that The Last Jedi has gotten\\, and the feeling that it wasn't really much of a Star Wars movie and that everything built up before it was thrown out: The mystery of Snoke basically getting thrown away\\, Luke's backstory and disposition in the movie\\, Kylo Ren's backstory as it related to Luke and Snoke\\, Leia's near death\/force powers\\, some of the seemingly pointless plot lines\\, all of the forced\/slapstick comedy. I can really get over all of those\\, and in a lot of ways I actually agree with a lot of those decisions and how they did a lot of those things in the movie. It was awesome to have something different and new\\, and add a lot of things that had never been done before in the series. I can understand all of the criticisms to the movie\\, and yet I can get on board with all of those story lines and the direction of every piece of the movie. Except one. I cannot get on board with Rey just \\\"being a nobody\\\"\\, no matter how much I think about it. I 100% completely agree with the argument that anybody should be able to be a hero or be able to use the force\\, and that anybody can basically become a Jedi\/be powerful with the force\\, and that it shouldn't be exclusive to just a certain few who come from a particular family. Hell in the prequels there were hundreds of other Jedi's and padawans who were obviously all force users. But yet having said that\\, I don't understand why they couldn't accomplish both. Why couldn't they show that anybody can be force sensitive and\/or become a Jedi while also having Rey have a deep personal\/family connection to the Skywalkers\/Ben Solo? At its core Star Wars is supposed to be about the Skywalker saga\\, that's the main point of the entire episodic series. And having Rey\\, the main protagonist be a nobody\\, in a lot of ways ruins all of that. What made the other Star Wars movies great were the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters as being the main conflict in the story. Luke vs Darth Vader\\, his father. Obi Wan vs Anakin\\, his apprentice\/best friend\/partner. By having Rey be a nobody\\, kind of makes this sequel trilogy pointless in a lot of ways. Yes obviously Kylo Ren is a Skywalker\/Solo\\, but he's not one of the 2-3 main protagonists that you as the audience are emotionally invested in or are supposed to share an emotional interest in. In the prequels that was Obi Wan\\, Anakin and Padme. In the original trilogy that was Luke\\, Lei\\, and Han. In this trilogy its Rey\\, Fin and Poe. By having Rey be a nobody\\, it's hard to really care about what happens to her or the people she cares about. Rey could die or go to the dark side or destroy the resistance in Episode 9\\, and yet nobody would really care\\, because she's a nobody in the story. The notion that for this movie the hardest thing Rey could hear would be that she was a nobody\\, feels extremely weak and short. That notion holds very little to Luke finding out Vader is actually his father\\, or Obi Wan finding out that Anakin had turned to the dark side and betrayed the Jedi order. This movie and sequel trilogy as a whole would be a lot more powerful and have a lot more meaning if Rey had a deeper interpersonal conflict with Ben\\, if say she found out they were actually brother and sister. These movies would be a lot more meaningful if Kylo Ren and Rey were pitted against each other\\, yet both were deeply conflicted because they couldn't kill their own sibling\\, the way Luke couldn't kill Vader\\, or Obi Wan couldn't kill Anakin. I'm trying to resign myself to the idea that I need to wait to see how everything comes full circle in Episode 9\\, to see if a lot of the holes and mysteries that have been put forth in this trilogy can be fulfilled in a more meaningful way\\, and that in my hopes they add much deeper significance to this piece of the story and to Rey's parentage\/back story\\, meaning\\, and interpersonal conflict\\, and that is the only reason why I am even giving this movie a 2\/5. I hate to say\\, but in a lot of ways this could honestly ruin much of the essence of Star Wars for me. If Rey was to somehow actually be a Skywalker and for that to come full circle in Episode 9\\, I would probably give this movie a 5\/5 in a heartbeat. But if Rey is still just a nobody after Episode 9 and the \\\"Skywalker saga\\\" is to be finished and thrown away the way it is right now\\, then to me this movie and trilogy would end up being a 0\/5\\, and most of my interest in the future of Star Wars would probably and unfortunately be gone.","true":true}
