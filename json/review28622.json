Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Promising start but literally went tits up for me 30 minutes in.  Save yourself some money and watch 'The Holiday Special' instead on Youtube.  Very disappointed overall\\, leaving the cinema dazed and confused.  And this director has been tasked with writing \/ directing a brand new trilogy.","true":true}
