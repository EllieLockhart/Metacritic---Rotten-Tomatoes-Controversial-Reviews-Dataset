Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though it cant compete with the original trilogy its by far way better than episodes 1\\, 2\\, 3 and 7. It s action a image are excellent. I love how Kylo Ren s character has changed!","true":true}
