Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The WORST Star Wars movie EVER made.  0\/10 \\n\\nSPOILER FREE\\n\\nWhen i came out of the theater i felt bad for the first time after watching a movie\\, i felt betrayed\\, insulted and disgusted\\, i couldn't believe that i have spent money to get trolled by Disney.\\nThis \\\"movie\\\" looks written and directed by a 9 years old for a 9 years old.\\nPlot holes EVERYWHERE\\, childish and pathetic humor all the time\\, that has no place in a Star Wars movie or in any war zone scenario\\, one-dimentional\\, uninteresting\\, undeveloped characters and main villains.\\nA Luke Skywalker COMPLETELY out of character that makes nonsensical decisions.\\nForce powers and shields functionality (and other stuff) in this movie are contradictory from one scene to another (a complete JOKE).\\nF***ing useless and pathetic space penguins with the only purpose to milk money from the audience with toys.\\nAnd this is just the TIP of iceberg of this offensive movie that has the ONLY PURPOSE of grab the most money possible from the fans with merchandise and sequels.\\n\\nDO NOT PAY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.","true":true}
