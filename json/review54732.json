{"101487":139571,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Power Ranger in the theater today. I have so much to say about it now. I thought reading the Wikipedia entry had prepared me for it\\, but the experience exceeded all my expectations!\\n\\nContrary to what I had expected from reading the summary\\, the whole story was NOT pointless. The end of the movie leaves the story in a significantly different place from when it started. For most movies you might take that for granted\\, but from reading the reviews I wasn't sure that was going to be the case\\, but it was\\, and that was nice. You won't be able to skip over this movie and still understand the Disney Star Wars trilogy.\\n\\nI liked the way Mark Hamill portrayed Jake Skywalker\\, a grizzled old Jedi Master clearly inspired by Luke Skywalker. The fact that they got the same actor to play both characters is a nice touch.\\n\\nI liked the way Jake Skywalker tried to educate the audience in the ways of the George Lucas Star Wars universe (e.g. the Force is not just for Jedis; Luke Skywalker can't defeat the Empire just by waving a laser sword).\\n\\nI liked some of the dialogue between Rey and Kylo (the \\\"You're a monster\\,\\\" \\\"Yes. I am\\,\\\" bit was particularly nice)\\, and I sort of liked the Twilight-over-Skype-themed relationship they developed\\, while a high-stakes space battle was raging elsewhere. (A space battle which\\, knowing what I knew about the plot\\, had me asking\\, \\\"Why are you throwing away this med-ship\\, foolish #Resistance? If lightspeed ramming is a thing in your story\\, why not have the med-ship ram the star destroyer? Why does the First Order not have custom-built lightspeed-equipped missiles for destroying enemy ships in one shot? Why don't both sides have such missiles? Why\\, sixty years after Star Wars\\, are they STILL flying around X-Wing fighters and basic TIE fighters?\\\" But I digress...)\\n\\nI also liked the space cows. The fact that they were made vaguely bipedal only enhanced how nonspecifically-disturbing they seemed. It was a nice touch.\\n\\nMy biggest takeaway: I am in awe. I'd like to say that I had no idea it was possible for a movie to be ludicrously bad on so many levels simultaneously--I'd like to say that\\, but I've seen \/Thor\/\\, directed by Branagh\\, so it would be false. Still\\, in terms of characterization\\, plot structure\\, originality\\, world-building\\, military tactics\\, logic\\, and pacing--the Last Power Ranger manages to be bad at ALL of these. There were definitely times during the movie when I could not stop laughing. I am in awe.\\n\\nI have soooooo much to say about this movie.","true":true}
