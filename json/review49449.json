Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst (YES WORST) Star wars movie\\nEmpty\\, wasted\\, not interesting\\, stupid movie\\nHumour - retarded\\nCharacters - not interesting\\, infuriating (pink hair gal)\\, wasted (phazma\\, snoke\\, luke\\, akbar\\, etc)\\nPlot - bad written adventure with no adventure... Nothing happens really... Rey is imbalanced perfect hero (in a bad way)\\, Kylo ren has unclear motivation\\, Snoke does nothing but speaking a bit\\, redhead guy is stupid (humour is instagram comdeians level bad). There is no legend to be told about this \\\"adventure\\\" because nothing happens really.\\nWatch it after dvd release\\, not in a theatre.\\nIt was bad\\, Jar jar wasn't AS bad as this movie","true":true}
