It was difficult to evade all of the people talking about the game prior to the release but I managed it.\r\rI genuinely thought this was the best action adventure video game I have ever played. Far superior to its predecessor. The story telling was mind blowing and the turn of events always had me guessing and took me by surprise. Needless to say\\, the world created by Naughty Dog was absolutely stunning.\r\rThe gameplay was smooth and I experienced no glitches in the mechanics. Dying was gruesome and the puzzles were rewarding. The enemies can be tough to beat (depending on the level of difficulty you play) but that makes it all the more exciting. The weaponry at your fingertips was really cool and allows you to play in many different ways.\r\rThis was a lesson on empathy. As a mental health academic and professional\\, one of the hardest things to explain to someone is how to be empathic. This game did that flawlessly. What you learn is that if you give someone a backstory then you suddenly feel for them and care for their humanity. All the differences between one another become futile in comparison to the insurmountable amount of commonalities that exist.\r\rOverall: Breathtaking storytelling. How they can get you to hate somebody and then reverse your feelings and feel for them was a feat like no other. A great case study on empathy and literally puts you in each characters shoes.\r\rFinally\\, I thought the inclusivity of a wide array of backgrounds was smooth and not forced into the story. In fact\\, I cannot see how the story would be so incredible had it not been for the unique experiences of each character.\r\rI never wanted this game to end. Yes\\, it's not the most uplifting. But that's the point. I found myself fearing human enemies much more than I feared clickers and bloaters. We create our own misery sometimes.\r\rThank you Naughty Dog and everyone who worked on this game for creating such a magnificent piece of art and passing it on to the world. I hope you all know this was truly a sight to behold and your hard-work was worthwhile. I can't wait to see what you have coming up next.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
