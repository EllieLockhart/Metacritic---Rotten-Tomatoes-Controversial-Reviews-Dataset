Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing sequel that shows a blatant disregard for its predecessor. So many head-scratching moments that lead to an unfunny joke and choices that pointlessly subvert expectations for the sake of subverting expectations. This movie is just full of bad choices.","true":true}
