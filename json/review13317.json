Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd say it was one of my most favorite Star Wars movies. The only part I didn't like was how Rose defied physics (or maybe her speeder was just faster) and smashed into Finn. I think maybe she should have hesitated to follow the order and stuck with him\\, then after seeing what he was planning\\, smash into him. That would have made more sense. But other than that\\, I think that everything was beautifully executed. \\nFans get upset when their expectations aren't met\\, and this movie shattered every single one of them.","true":true}
