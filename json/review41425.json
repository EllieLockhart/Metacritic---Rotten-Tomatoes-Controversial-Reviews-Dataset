Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a passing of the torch\\, die hard fans that take episode 4\\,5\\,6 as the SW holy bible cant stand it just like they couldn't stand 1\\,2\\,3. other than a few things such as bodies flying through space and awkward placement of jokes this movie was superb and a great continued bridge for the changing of the guard.","true":true}
