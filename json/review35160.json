Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was uninspired\\, but it left us with the hope of further development of our main characters. I can't say it delivered. The characters\\, which always have been the biggest aspect and strength of Star Wars\\, remain uninteresting throughout this viewing as well. The ones that had potential to develop from the first movie in this trilogy go nowhere in favor if defying expectations\\, which goes nowhere as well. The twists feel pointless and that the writing likes to be unpredictable for the sake of being so\\, instead of doing something clever\\, interesting and new for the series.","true":true}
