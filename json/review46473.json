Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was The Last Jedi the Best Star Wars Film ever? Can it even be compared to Empire Strikes Back? That is a big NO\\, not even by a long shot. The movie answered no questions from the previous film\\, Had a Hero that absolutely did nothing\\, a General Le\u00eda that had super human powers to survive the vaccum of Space\\, and at times felt like a Animated Disney movie more so than a Star Wars saga. With all that being said\\, the movie did keep me awake and focused for 2 and a half hours. It did not make the top 3 best but it was enjoyable just enough to get a pass. ","true":true}
