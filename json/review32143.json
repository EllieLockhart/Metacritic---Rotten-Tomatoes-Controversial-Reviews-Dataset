Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER WARNING I do not see why so many disliked The Last Jedi. Especially how they presented Luke. So many people are stuck on their preconceived ideologies of who and what Luke is; an infallible hero who would never run from a fight. Luke is my favorite hero and certainly I agree in part with this. Sure I wish Luke would have boarded the falcon with Rey and sped off to dual Ren and Snoke. But the way they portrayed Luke was so much better; a wounded and broken hero who has to rediscover himself. This is a Luke Skywalker who failed Ben Solo greatly and who let his fear of the unknown cloud his vision. Yes this was his weakness\\, but it made his character much better than a perfect never failing hero. ","true":true}
