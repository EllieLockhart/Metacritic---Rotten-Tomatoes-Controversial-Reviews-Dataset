Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a solid movie. Visuals are amazing\\, especially for the space combats. So I can completely understand why critics have been giving upbeat reviews. BUT\\, and this is a big but\\, this movie falls flat as a Star Wars film. It feels like the director did not even watch the earlier Star Wars films. Major characters are poorly developed or have abrupt character arc ends. The characters' motivations and personalities often do not gel with previous films. This movie was so bad as a Star Wars saga\\, that I have no interest in Episode 9 anymore. Rian Johnson killed the SW franchise for me\\, and I believe a lot of core fans will also feel the same.","true":true}
