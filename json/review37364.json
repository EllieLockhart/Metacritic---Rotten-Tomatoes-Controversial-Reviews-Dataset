Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are many things that sucked in this movie\\, but the one that stood out for me was the way they treated luke. They show absolutley no respect to luke\/mark hamill and the character was a huge disappointment.. sad to see what he has become thanks to rian","true":true}
