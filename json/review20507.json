Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve been reading a lot of negative reviews about this movie. Although it\u2019s to be expected since people find change hard\\, and this is definitely a deviation from other Star Wars movies. But it is amazing. It\u2019s a fun\\, suspenseful\\, and just an amazingly well done movie. Though many of the choices in it were unexpected\\, they were awesome. People are probably just salty because all their theories about everything were wrong. ","true":true}
