Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was fantastic\\, something deep and different from all the past movies.  sort of like the later versions of star wars the clone wars.  if the director wanted Luke to die in the end and Disney approved it\\, then fine by me.  Only thing they could have cut out was Leia in space\\, no other jedi has done that\\, so we didn't need her to do it..","true":true}
