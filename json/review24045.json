Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill was amazing. Standout performance & he just nailed it on every level. The character of Luke however was treated very poorly as were all the other classic OT characters. I hope KK & RJ both get sacked for mistreating these precious characters so poorly & betraying the OT fans who built the brand in the first place! They clearly do not understand what to do with these characters so either kill them off or sideline them. It would work best all round if they just did not even bother using them again rather than antagonise the OT fans so much & so clearly. TLJ actually made TPM look so good now! Help us Obi-Wan Lucas your our only hope now!!!","true":true}
