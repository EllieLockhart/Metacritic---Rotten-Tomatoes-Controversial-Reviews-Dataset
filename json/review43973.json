Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Three complaints.. \\nOne\\, the universe felt very small.  Not enough planet exploration this time around.\\nTwo\\, not enough light sabre battles.  I don't even think two light sabres clashed.\\nAnd three\\, Finn's side quest was really pointless and boring.\\nAll of my other complaints are really minor.","true":true}
