Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much potential\\, so little fulfillment. My first complaint is what they did with Luke\\, so lame. Then\\, Fin's role was completely pointless. The humor was lame and cheesy. Too much of the characters saying exactly what was going on as a way to explain to the audience. Came off as too obvious. Then the whole anti rich people\\, animal abuse messages were just weird. Didn't like that. The ending was pretty cool\\, but a bad overall Star Wars movie. A dang shame really.","true":true}
