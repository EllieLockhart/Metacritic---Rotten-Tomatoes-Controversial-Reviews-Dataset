Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining in the sense of it's Star Wars and you get familiar score\\, familiar sounds\\, ships\\, etc.  But that's about it.  That's a far as it goes\\, really.  Thanks Disney!  First ESPN\\, now Star Wars.  What's next?  Is Mickey Mouse going to be announced that he's really a transgender?","true":true}
