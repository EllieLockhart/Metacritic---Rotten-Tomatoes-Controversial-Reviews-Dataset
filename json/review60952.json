I don't understand why people think there was plot holes everywhere and the backstory for Abby wasn't enough\\, I felt for her and I understood so much by getting to play as her\\, at first I wasn't so happy because this girl killed Joel! but in the end I understood why they did it.\rThe ending made so much sense\\, the game took such a crazy turn that I didn't expect at all. but in the end it broke my heart. But i'm so happy I got to play it and feel such strong emotions from a game. It had the same mechanics as the first game which I loved\\, and the character development from Ellie at the end of the game was outstanding.
