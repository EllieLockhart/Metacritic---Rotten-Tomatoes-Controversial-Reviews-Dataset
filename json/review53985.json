Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am now convinced that Disney will kill Star Wars.  The latest movie is absolutely lacking the heart and soul of Star Wars.  The plot is so convoluted and several events take place that should make you question numerous events not just in this movie but also in past movies too.  Just massive plot holes.  The Last Jedi completely tramples the lore of Star Wars.  The  mythos\\, the \\\"facts\\,\\\" the importance of Star Wars and its past.  The performances are well done\\, individual moments and scenes are amazing even\\, and overall the movie cinematically looks great.  However\\, as a whole package\\, it does not work because several of the most important components of any good movie are missing.  For Last Jedi\\, it is story\\, heart\\, impact to certain character's motivations.  I am avoiding spoilers but nearly step by step\\, scene by scene\\, anyone could rip this movie apart.  Literally\\, \\\"THAT MAKES NO SENSE!\\\"  Consider Vice Admiral Holdo's impact to the movie for a moment\\, why wasn't this \\\"trick\\\" done over and over again in space combat?  Why not against the Death Stars?  Why was the trench run even needed then?  There are other examples but attempting to avoid spoilers as previously stated.\\n\\nI greatly fear for the entirety of the Star Wars Saga.  At this point\\, I can definitely say I miss George Lucas.","true":true}
