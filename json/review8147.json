Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic. I've been a fan since 1977. This is truly innovative and masterful filmmaking from Rian Johnson and the most adult take on characters previously presented as bigger than life heroes and villains. We see them as complex human beings and this enriches the Star Wars experience like never before.\\nSide note: it has been revealed that the poor audience rating is largely a result of fake accounts and bots made solely for the purpose of trashing the movie. Yes\\, some people are ludicrous but don't let that fool you. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!","true":true}
