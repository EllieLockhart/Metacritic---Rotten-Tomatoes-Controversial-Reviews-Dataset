Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry for the bad english but \\, i will makde it short without spoilers to be as clear as possible.\\n\\nThis movie is a complete massacre of the franchise\\, its already bad as a movie because it has a terrible pacing\\, terrible and missplaced humor \\, one of the main \\\"plot\\\" of the movie is just related to some people being deeply stupid...\\n\\nAnd as a star wars movie\\, well it takes everything you knew about the franchise and just throw it out the window\\, with no reason  at all\\, just to break the code...\\n\\nYou can litteraly sums up the entiere movie in 2 sentences","true":true}
