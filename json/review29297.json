Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian destroyed all the great work JJ did in the Force Awakens. This was set up for Rian to do a simple layup but failed miserably. The script and story flow was pure rubbish. Visually however cinematography and CGI was good some of the best. But that script was so awe full. JJ you\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)re our only hope.","true":true}
