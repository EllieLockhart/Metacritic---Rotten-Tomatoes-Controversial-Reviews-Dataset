Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney have finally put a nail in the coffin with this mess of a film. They ignore 40 years of legacy to try to please Everyone All of the time. Not good enough !!!","true":true}
