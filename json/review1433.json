Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fanatoc\\, i can say that the film is very disjointed. Finn and Rose basically run around the whole film doing nothing to advance the plot\\,  though they do meet Del Toro's White Lando analogue. Rey and Luke's story is a total nightmare\\, where we are treated to a retconned version of the Force that violates decades of precedent across nine films and three cartoon television series\\, where the dark side\\, previously an aberration is now just a spook\\, because neither dark nor light exist or something. Luke also seems to be a completely different person than he was last we really met him in RotJ\\, in ways that remain perplexingly unresolved. When he says that it's hubris to think the light will go out with the Jedi Luke makes a grossly false point. You see\\, the Jedi are merely a group\\, yes\\, but they are clearly needed\\,  and any group to rise up in their stead would have to have the same doctrine (since canonically the Qui-Gon had the true and correct interpretation of the Force) simply through existing through the Force\\, but it's important to not that it took the Jedi thousands of years to develop their ideas\\, so it would be selfish to try and kill the Jedi and set the light back in such a way. At some point Luke is confronted by Yoda's ghost\\, lamely as a puppet\\, who can apparently physically touch Luke and summon thunderbolt. Both things never demonstrated before! Yoda also goes on to call the most sacred texts of his order\\, which he'd no doubt memorized in his youth\\,  BORING and says that Rey already had the teaching inside her\\, an impossibilty. It's freaking insulting. Rey goes into an \\\"evil\\\" cave\\, sees stupid visions which couldn't possibly mean anything. All this while waiting outside Luke's but a la Project Mayhem's membership drives from Fight Club. There are great moments\\, but they're kind of lost between all the jokes (one every 5 to 10 minutes) and all the story that doesn't go anywhere. Kylo's plot is sort of interesting\\, but when Snoke makes fun of Kylo's mask it totally took me out of the film\\,  since as recent as 2016 Disney put out books saying that those masks carry a religious\\, cultic significance. His Pope just made fun of his cross\\, man! Kylo and Rey's subplot is stupid and violates so much about the Force... also\\, it's shot poorly. It uses dialogs to explain things to the viewer that they should have just showed us.\\nThere's just so much dumb going on in this film... for instance\\, it seems to start weeks or months after TFA\\, and picks up with the Republic being disbanded and all remaining Resistence and Republic forces now number a mere 400. Which is a weird place to start.  Last we saw the Resistance they were celebrating a major victory. \\n\\nI actually kinda liked the astral projection bit\\, and Luke's final scene was well shot\\, but unemotional since he's such a jackass for no good reason the whole film. This is honestly in my opinion the worst Star Wars film as of yet.\\nI>III>V>IV>II>VI>Rogue One>VII>TCW>VIII","true":true}
