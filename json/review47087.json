Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible movie. There is nothing I can say here that hasn't been stated. I read 30 pages of audience reviews and of those 30 recent pages\\, most are filled with phony one line reviews boasting 5 stars. Are the directors and producers such spineless losers that they must try to change history using bots? You made it\\, it was awful\\, own up to it. People are signing up to review this movie because of the bot activity. Disney and the critics are lying. It is a steaming pile of dookie. If it upset devoted fans so be it\\, even the most devoted fans will still call a bad movie a bad movie. The Last Jedi was simply a terrible movie.","true":true}
