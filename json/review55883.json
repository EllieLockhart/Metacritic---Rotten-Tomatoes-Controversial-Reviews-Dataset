Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really don\u2019t understand the hate here. Hopefully this will be remembered in the same way Empire Strikes Back is - i.e. a similar amount of hate upon release\\, but in time heralded as a masterpiece of storytelling. While this doesn\u2019t warrant the same praise as said classic (yet)\\, this is an incredibly strong entry in the Star Wars film universe. The strongest since Empire for sure. Great characterization\\, you can feel the stakes rising at every turn\\, and the film makes very bold and intelligent decisions all around. This is a film that doesn\u2019t spoon-feed fandom the same archetypes and beats like Force Awakens. It doesn\u2019t make goofy mistakes like Return of the Jedi or the Prequels. Everything approached dramatically\\, it all sticks\\, and it ADDS the lore; it DOES NOT belittle or step on it. I\u2019m very much looking forward to what they do with Episode IX\\, and I\u2019m really stoked for Rian Johnson\u2019s forthcoming stand-alone (non-Skywalker-centric) trilogy! It\u2019s excellent.","true":true}
