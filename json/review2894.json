Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful what they did to our beloved heroes.  Princess Leia was introduced to the world as a strong woman\\, which was not typical typecast in 1977.  Now 30 years alter\\, Leia is doing basically the same job\\, she has no friends\\, and the first time she uses her force powers\\, it's in a selfish manner.  Just wow.  Don't get me started on Luke\\, the new hope\\, most optimistic kid in the galaxy.  WTF.  I'm a long time fan and this movie is the end of the franchise for me.  It's also the first time I can recall on rotten tomatoes where the audience score is significantly lower than the critics.  Disney is the First Order.","true":true}
