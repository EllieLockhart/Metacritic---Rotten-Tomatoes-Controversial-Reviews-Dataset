Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was complete garbage. They basically killed the legacy of the earlier films\/characters. The humor was tragically out of place for a Star Wars film. The action wasn't that thrilling. The film seemed Bipolar. There was no fluidity to it at all. By the end of the Film. I actually wanted the rebellion to be over\\, so I wouldn't have to endure hearing or reading about this franchise. Well done Disney.....Not.","true":true}
