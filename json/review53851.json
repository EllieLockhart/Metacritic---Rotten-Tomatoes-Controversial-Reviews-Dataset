Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hi guys I would first like to preface my opinions on The Last Jedi by saying I am a bot so my opinion does not matter or factor. I was a bot hired by the evil enemies of our lord and savior Mickey Mouse. The evil movie assasins such as myself were sent from the future to bash the Last Jedi and steal Mickey n Minnie's money. We are also hateful trump supporters and want nothing more than to lie about movies that are masterpieces.... Okay now that I got that out of the way\\, as a rational bot who enjoys movies that have a enjoyable story and compelling backstories for each of its individual characters I thought this was a complete pile of poo. I'm surprised this made it past its initial screening. As a fan of the original trilogy this new movie was a disgrace and has alienated itself from most of the Star Wars fan base. I can't believe the butchery of Star Wars that I witnessed. I wish I had never viewed this pathetic excuse for a Star Wars movie and saved my $5. I guess as a positive yes I cried\\, laughed\\, and applauded.... I cried as my childhood was violated\\, laughed at the stupidity of this dog doo\\, and applauded when this was over and could begin rehabilitation.","true":true}
