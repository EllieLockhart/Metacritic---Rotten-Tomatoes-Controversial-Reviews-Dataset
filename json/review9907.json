Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great continuation of the story. Succeeded in further developing the new core characters while thoughfully completing the arch of the original core and perfectly sets up for an amazing episode IX.","true":true}
