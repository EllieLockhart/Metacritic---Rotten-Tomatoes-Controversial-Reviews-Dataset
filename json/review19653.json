Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a fantastic movie. I think some of the comedic scenes were a little much\\, and didn't need to make it to the final cut\\, but overall the whole movie was fantastic and Ieft the theatre with chills.","true":true}
