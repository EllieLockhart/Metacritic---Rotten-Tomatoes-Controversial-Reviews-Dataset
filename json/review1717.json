Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a sci-fi movie\\, it's fun if you don't think too much.  Once you get past the cool action scenes though\\, the many plot holes and pointless scenes to pad the runtime really ruined it for me.  If you're a Star Wars fan\\, you'll dislike it even more.  Little to no character development and conflicting moments with what was already established in the Star Wars universe.  Overall\\, disappointing\\, to say the least.","true":true}
