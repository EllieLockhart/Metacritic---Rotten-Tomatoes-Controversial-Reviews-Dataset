Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrific. The worst part about it?: STAR WARS FANS! Nobody hates Star Wars quite like so-called fans. I was moved to tears by this film. Mark Hamill was amazing\\,Daisy Ridley is an absolute Star\\, and Rian Johnson is an incredible story teller. Reading the user comments on this site is actually making me ashamed of my fandom.
