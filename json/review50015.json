Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"YUK!\\nVery Disappointing plot\\, Missed opportunities between Luke's new understanding of the Force and him teaching Rey....Really liked the Yoda cameo!\\nSome major plot hook miscues (Space Chase being first and foremost\\, and Lea's Force? Child please!)\\, And more of the little guy rising up would have been great but completely missed.\\nThe Villains are too...Disney for my liking\\, Snoke's assessment of Ben \\\"as A spoiled boy in a mask\\\" is spot on! Great line and interaction.\\n\\nBut what really does this move injustice is the tired old tropes from movies past\\, just remaking old scenes with better special effects is a negative in my mind. \\n\\nInteresting the ROTTEN TOMAOTOE website won't accept this rating (1.5 stars\\, simply for the Yoda scene) of the movie? Some dark side behind the scenes buyouts happening?","true":true}
