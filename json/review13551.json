Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel terrible giving this a bad score. I feel like all the actors put their best feet forward\\, given the material\\, and there are pieces of a film I could have loved in the finished product. Unfortunately\\, the excessive humor and subversion for subversion's sake didn't jive with me. Here's hoping the ninth episode can somehow satisfy both the people who disliked this film as well those who liked it. The potential of the cast\\, as well as the world-building done in previous films\\, are too rich to be spent on something that is divides the fandom so deeply\\, rather than uniting it.","true":true}
