Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wish I could give this garbage a negative rating. This was the biggest disappointment of the year for sure. The story has plot holes the size of star killer base\\, they completely forget about plots they introduced on episode 7 or rewrite it and think the audience wont notice. Don't go to watch this movie\\, wait for it to be on rental or Netflix.","true":true}
