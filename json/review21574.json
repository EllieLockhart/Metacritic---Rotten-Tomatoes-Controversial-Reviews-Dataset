Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams' Force Awakens might of been predictable\\, very PC and playing it safe. But It setup for lot of good story that had me genuinely curious on a lot of yet to be developed plot points\\, I was optimistic for TLJ.\\n\\nBut my god. Rian Johnson destroyed almost every single developing story JJ left to be expanded\\, all for nothing. This movie is a complete mess\\, so many occasions it missed the mark from obliterating the very cherished lore of the franchise to it being filled with pointless B-plot characters that all achieve nothing with what remains is a painful experience with as many plot holes as swiss cheese. \\n\\nI genuinely think this is the worst Star Wars film I've seen. I don't see how the SW franchise can redeem itself at this point.","true":true}
