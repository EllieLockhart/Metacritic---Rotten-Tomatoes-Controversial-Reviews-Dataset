Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many other die hard Star Wars fans\\, I am hard to please when it comes to new Star Wars films because the original trilogy is such a masterpiece. However\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, in my opinion\\, is undoubtably the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy. The movie is filled with excellent plot twists\\, action\\, and emotion. There were moments in The Last Jedi where I\\, along with my friends\\, simply dropped our jaws in awe of the amazing twists and turns of the plot. It was great to see Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, and other new characters grow. It was also great to discover new things about our beloved Princess (General) Leia Organa and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a must see film for all Star Wars fans\\, and I am proud to include it in the top tier of all Star Wars films!","true":true}
