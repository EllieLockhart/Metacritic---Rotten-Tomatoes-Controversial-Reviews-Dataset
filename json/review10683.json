Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some great action scenes\\, but I'd rate it as the worse star wars film that has thus far been released.\\nPhantom Menace\\, widely considered the Weakest film comes across as an epic film in comparison to this.\\nPod racing vs riding a giant donkey through a city\\, darth maul vs Red sith guards?
