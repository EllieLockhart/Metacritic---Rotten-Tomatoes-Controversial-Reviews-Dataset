{"101487":143777,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It takes some twists and turns\\, but nothing that makes the story any better\\, just there for the sake of having them. Luke's arc with Vader is completely ruined when it's explained he nearly murdered Kylo Ren in his sleep out of anger and fear\\, despite the fact his own father destroyed Aldaraan in front of Leia and almost killed Luke\\, yet luke still tried to turn him to the good side of the force in ROTJ. The entirety of the casino subplot with Finn and Rose\\, who feels forced in the plot for diversity sake\\, had potential but completely stunk and had literally no point in furthering the plot. I was pleased with Daisy Ridley's performance\\, but her character still feels Mary Sue-ish. The movie was atleast brave enough to try new stuff with the saga\\, like having Rey and Kylo fight Snoke's guards. It also gets points because a lot of the effects were nice to look at\\, and the jokes delivered for the most part.","true":true}
