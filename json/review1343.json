Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Arguably my favorite Star Wars film\\, The Last Jedi beautifully paints the most meaningful pictures in development and relationships. Internal strengths\\, flaws\\, and ignorances are vividly exposed to create relatable and convicting conflicts and resolutions.\\n\\nInstead of dabbling in fanfare questions and theories\\, Johnson highlights perhaps the most human perspective on our hero's journey: that with great power comes great responsibility. Our favorite Skywalker is only human\\, and he bears the weight of his choices and identity like all of us. A theme which echos powerfully in the epicenter of the film: Kylo and Rey's story.\\n\\nPaired with stunning locations\\, breathtaking moments\\, and a subtly familiar yet fresh plot\\, this Star Wars story excels in expanding the universe: bursting the doors wide open for a unique and powerful finale\\, much like Empire did a long time ago...","true":true}
