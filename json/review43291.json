Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a far cry from the original Star Wars movies. The main villains remind me of the pathetic villains from Marvel movies. They are built to be this big bad villain but in the end it\u2019s a let down. Neither apprentice received any training to justify their power levels. There seemed to be no detailed explanation on why Luke Skywalker felt the way he felt about the force or the jedi. As a stand alone movie it would be solid\\, but as a Star Wars movie\\, the the lineage and expectation of a Star Wars movie this was a disappointment. They copied and pasted multiple scenes from empire strikes back and return of the Jedi. It\u2019s sad Disney allowed little to no input from George Lucas the original creator of Star Wars. This felt like another watered down Star Wars movie for a new generation that are blessed or cursed to not have the knowledge of the originals. ","true":true}
