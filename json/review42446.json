Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a dumpster fire of immature humor and non-existent plot. The characters were cardboard cutouts that had absolutely no emotional connection to the audience or each other. It took the good things of the original trilogy like Luke and Leia and made them obnoxious and overpowered\\, more reminiscent of a bad Marvel movie then Star Wars. The Last Jedi was a dragging cringe fest that felt like a 5 hour long toy commercial rather than a new installment to a beloved series. Disney should be ashamed.","true":true}
