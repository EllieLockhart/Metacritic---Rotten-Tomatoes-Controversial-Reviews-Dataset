Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A soft sci fi movie thick with backwards logic\\, pandering\\, and childish humor that lacks adherence to the rules and motives of the established narrative. A light fan might enjoy it's farcical antics\\, random action and melodrama. But for most people this market engagement piece for Disney's star wars property is wholly and ridiculously unenjoyable.","true":true}
