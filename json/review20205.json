Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok. Not great. Not terrible. But ok. It is a Modern Disney Interpretation of a non Disney franchise. It feels different than the original trilogy. I discount the second trilogy as garbage. I can see why George Lucas would Cringe a bit at this. And I think about Walt Disney's creativity from the 50s and I see the entire Disney experience devolving into mass marketing\\, political correctness and robotic happy faces. Like a Disney Channel movie. It's the same \\\"diverse\\\" casting and cute plastic animals\\, CGI and light saber battles. I want to really like the characters like a heroic Han Solo or young Luke Skywalker. But the characters here are pretty Disneyfied. Anyway it's ok. Go see it. But I don't think any best actor academy awards will be had.","true":true}
