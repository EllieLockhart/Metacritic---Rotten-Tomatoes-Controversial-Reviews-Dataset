Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ has a refreshing feel to a new generation of Star Wars. While most negative remarks are of fans who are whether so stuck in their ways as to veto anything that offers new perspective\\, or fans who need to delve deeper into the conceptual plan of episode VIII before shutting down the end plan we will see in episode IX. \\n\\nAlthough I'm a huge advocate for the dark side and it's mythos\\, I was a little disappointed on this movie's lack of depth into the Knights of Ren or Snoke's origination\/purpose. Although\\, the trilogy is not over. In Empire Strikes Back\\, the audience didn't know the Emperor was Chancellor Palpatine\\, named Sheev and assassinated his master in his sleep\\, yet it's recognized as one of the best films in the franchise. As fans\\, we enter episode VIII with countless scenarios we'd like to see come to life on screen\\, but the producers have another installment plus multiple renditions of anthology films to delve into the mystery we all strive to understand in this galaxy \\\"far\\, far away.\\\" \\n\\nTLJ has great surprise\\, action\\, levity\\, and depth. Rey's parents are finally exposed as drug addicts who sold her in exchange for another \\\"fix.\\\" Most negative viewers are startled and upset at her irrelevant and insignificant parents\\, yet the concept of Rey being \\\"a nobody\\\" is perhaps the most familiar scenario true Star Wars fans should recognize. Anakin had no father and was raised a slave. Palpatine and Plageuis failed in their manipulation to bring Anakin to life while the force randomly chose Schmi Skywalker to birth Anakin to bring balance to the force. TLJ recognizes that even \\\"nobodies\\\" can be force sensitive heroes\\, much like Anakin. \\n\\nThe comical scenes in TLJ seem to add much humor for a well rounded crowd\\, while the intense scenes brings the viewer back in to concentrate on the plot's motive leading into episode IX. Luke's peaceful death at the film's conclusion is a respectful comparison to Yoda's departure from Luke in ROTJ. Luke's lengthy connection with the force has paid off to deliver him a peaceful death. While Yoda died to exemplify the peaceful nature of the force to Luke\\, his death enables Luke to resist the emperor. Perhaps Luke's \\\"purposeful\\\" death has more meaning than his absence. We'll have to wait and see in episode IX. Overall\\, the film offered a great dynamic with pleasant surprises\\, but like every film it has areas where some Star Wars fans simply won't concur. \\n\\nI look forward to the next installment. Well done\\, Johnson. \\n\\n-JL","true":true}
