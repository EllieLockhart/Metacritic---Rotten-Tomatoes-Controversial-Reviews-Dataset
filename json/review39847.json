Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible film. It is extremely badly written\\, meaning that there is no real story. Worse\\, the main characters are treated with unbelievable disrespect\\, and the same goes for the Star Wars main ideas and ideals. This film is probably going to destroy Star Wars forever\\, or at least everything that was good about it. Although I am not a Star Wars fan\\, I fellt it necessary to write this review to warn other moviegoers and give feedback to Disney that we are not as stupid as they seem to believe we are. People hate this movie\\, and I can only imagine that the \\\"critics\\\" wre paid for giving positive reviews. This film is a disgrace\\, and I am so sad for the actors who had to play in it and bear the consequences\\, and for everyone who loved Star Wars.","true":true}
