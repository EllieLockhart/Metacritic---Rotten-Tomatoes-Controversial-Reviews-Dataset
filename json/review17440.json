Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this film on the 17th\\, but I am just now writing my review\\, as there was so much to unpack and think about after the movie. Good CGI and good acting leads to a good movie\\, and this was no exception. But it certainly wasn't the best. I almost feel as though too much happened\\, and I am not sure where they will go and what they will do\\, but I guess they want viewers to not know what will happen next. Problem I felt it had was that it had two major storylines going on at once. Usually a film has one major and one smaller storyline. This left me almost overwhelmed\\, as the movie made me do all kinds of thinking\\, which other films wouldn't make me do as much of. But if you overlook that\\, this is a good Star Wars movie for anyone who enjoys awesome lightsaber battles\\, and anyone who quite honestly likes Star Wars.","true":true}
