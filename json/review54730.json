Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it opening day and remember coming out of the theater with the other fans in a confused haze. I wanted to love this movie so much\\, but it could not have been that awful right?  It's Star Wars\\, and I even liked the prequels\\, so i must just be in shock.  So I went to see it again\\, and our was even worse. I tried this 6 times\\, and it is the only movie where it literally got worse with every viewing. Each one revealed a bigger plot hole than the previous viewing. The story arc goes no where. So much pointless banter\\, attempts at humor\\, and bad storytelling. 2 scenes that were decent were throne room fight\\, and... I take it back\\, that was it. I have read all the articles\\, forums\\, and arguments\\, trying to find a way to like this part of my favorite franchise\\, and at the end of the day\\, it is just a bad movie from every aspect\\, poor dialogue\\, bad character choices\\, no plot development\\, wasted characters\\, etc etc etc. Really sad that Disney has allowed this and rather than bite the bullet and admit mistakes\\, they blame the fan base? Glad to see their stance has changed a little bit since the failure of this movie and Solo\\, but it doesn't say much considering they are still allowing Rian Johnson to direct a trilogy after this debacle and all the backlash. That is just not smart business. Really sorry Disney\\, but you were given a choice to do\\, or do not\\,  and you did NOT make a movie worthy of being in the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
