The game would have not felt\\, so long and dragging.\r\rFor example: When you finish the main campaign\\, and the title screen tell you \\\"You can replay the game with game Plus blah...blah...\\\" a second message pop up. Also\\, for finishing the main campaign you now unlock \\\"Abby story\\\". This way the player can choose to play Abby story till the End.\r\rI also feel the ending should have 2 ending. One giving you the choose to kill Abby\\, and a Second choose to let Abby go.
