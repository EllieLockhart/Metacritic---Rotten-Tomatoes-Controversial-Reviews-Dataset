Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Expectations were lofty for this film and I did expect some disappointments but ... what Isaw was just terrible. It's fine for a director to take things in another direction but the entire film is a betrayal to what I have always loved about Star Wars. I feel like the entire movie was written to pander to the liberal media that would be responsible for the reviews and to that end I guess it was a triumph but I left the cinema truly depressed. Don't think I'll even go to the next one\\, it's not even Star Wars anymore to me.","true":true}
