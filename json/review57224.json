Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie deserves alot more respect then it is getting. The Last Jedi Might have some problems (Canto Bight slows the movie down\\, No Giant fight scene) but overall it's a new fresh star wars film and many things in this movie has never been done before. Rian Johnson has made Star Wars fresh and new. Everyone's entitled to their opinion BUT\\, you have to see that Rian Johnson has created something new and completely different from any other of the Star Wars Episodes. Before you say anything about this movie you must at least see it twice\\, because the second viewing makes the movie twice as better.","true":true}
