Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have now seen the movie twice\\, on first viewing I probably would have given it a 3\/5\\, but on a repeat viewing it's problems become painfully obvious.\\n\\nmy biggest problem is that the movie literally wastes your time\\, you could have completely removed Finn and Rose from the movie and not had the whole attempt to disable the tracking systems\\, and replaced it with an ambitious sensor officer in the first order and it would improve the movie.\\n\\nI also really didn't like where they took Luke's character\\, making him angry and spiteful I kinda see it\\, but at the same time the person who could see the good in Darth Vader was so scared by the darkness in Ben Solo who is Luke's friend at this point\\, that he instinctively reached for violence . . . doesn't really wash with what I can see happening with the Luke from original trilogy.\\n\\nI also don't mind that they killed Luke per se\\, but the whole astral projection thing was really cool initially but really really stupid on repeat viewing.\\n\\nFinally say no to Sea Cows!","true":true}
