Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor writing. Poor villains. No character motivations. Long useless subplots. Oh and the main character is invincible. This movie goes from cool\\, to oh wow interesting\\, to wow no pay off\\, and lol that's cheesy and SOOO predictable. Finally it's over. Movie tries to be political..\\n\\nAnother review talks about how LJ is similar to The Walking Dead.. yep.. twists for the sake of twists- not doing anything for the story. \\n\\nCan't believe this has a 93% on RT - I think they'll just give any disney movie a high score.","true":true}
