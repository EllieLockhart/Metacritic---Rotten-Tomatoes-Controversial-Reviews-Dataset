Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How in God's name did this film get made? How in God's name did no one at Disney see the massive plot holes all over the script? I would literally need 1\\,000 pages to write out every problem with this film. I wanted to walk out after an hour. 2 audience members in a room full of 150 hardcore fanboys clapped at the finish. 2. Horrific beyond my wildest dreams. Star Wars is beyond repair now. How did this happen???????","true":true}
