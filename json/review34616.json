Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cast was good.  The Throne Room was awesome and the Reylo connection was great.  But the rest of the movie was garbage.  Not the actors fault at all but just the horrible direction but Rian.  What he did with luke was a shame.  No point in TFA after this.  Will I stop watching the new ones\\, no.  Rogue One was a great movie\\, and while TFA wasn't great and didn't take risks\\, at least it was Star Wars.  TLJ is just dumb\\, I mean the whole movie is built around a dumb chase across space.  We know Star Destroyers could catch the Falcon\\, why couldn't it catch a damaged cruiser.  Come on.  Just horrible writing.  This story was not good.  It did have some LOL moments and some good scenes.  Everyone talks about Rey being a Mary Sue\\, what about Poe and his Xwing against a dreadnought.  Or Leia going all Mary Poppins.  What a joke.","true":true}
