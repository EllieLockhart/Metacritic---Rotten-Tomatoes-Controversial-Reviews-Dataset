Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, and so is my Wife. We saw this film\\, at the El Capitan theatre (Disney owned theatre in Hollywood) opening day. Without getting into spoilers\\, we both hated the film. So much\\, that we have put all our Star Wars Shirts\/Art\/Figures in storage. I don't understand how in the world this movie script got approved. So many plot holes\\, so many bad decisions\\, to the point of killing the whole universe for us. We have no plans to re-watch or purchase anything related to this movie. So very sad to see a much loved series run into the mud yet again.","true":true}
