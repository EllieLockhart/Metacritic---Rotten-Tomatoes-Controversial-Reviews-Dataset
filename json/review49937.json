Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You just took a giant Shit all over the first movie and rogue one.... Disney has fallen from grace with this flop of a movie.  The political nuances that escaped the first movie hasn't snuck into this movie. They have been splashed throughout the entire plot. Rose had absolutely no reason for being in the movie. Could shorten it by eliminating her scenes. Making Finn a wussy I understand because he was in Force awaken. Luke an ass was a little extreme. Making a love interested between Rey and Ren was so stupid if you were going for the feminist I don't need a man.  Just make them the exact opposites and leave it at that. PS killing him was a bold move which I did love.","true":true}
