Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is the longest Star Wars yet. It is also the slowest\\, most boring\\, most poorly written\\, clearly a cash grab\\, apparently the most socially conscious star wars movie ever. I will note that there are several beautiful scenes which almost made me forget about the first half of the movie\\, but then one of the characters would say something\\, dialogue that sounds as if a 5-year-old wrote it\\, and the whole scene would be ruined\\, despite the wonderful visual effects and always wonderful score. The unwanted\\, terribly timed humor didn't work 100% of the time. The Force Awakens tired it\\, nailed it. The Last Jedi tried it\\, bombed it. Several crack and quips were funny but were so forced it felt like the director said\\, \\\"Hey\\, they liked Guardians of the Galaxy\\, right? Let's put some dumb line during a characters death.\\\" Sorry Johnson\\, doesn't work for star wars. The useless humor fared just as well as the activism. The symbolism\\, the messages about animal cruelty and social equality\\, absolutely the lowest point of the movie. The side adventure of Finn and Rose was worse than listening to C-3PO ramble on in the desert. At least the droids had valuable dialogue.","true":true}
