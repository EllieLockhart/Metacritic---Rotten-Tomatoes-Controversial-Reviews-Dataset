Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest disappointment of the decade. \\nThe story is full of plot holes and useless subplots. The twists are so big and coming from nowhere that they kill the immersion.\\nTake the force for example\\, it is used as a \\\"deus ex machina\\\" to solve every scenario dead-end.\\nThey literally killed every idea from episode 7 as if they wanted to start on a clean slate for episode 9.\\n\\nMark Hamill is doing he's best to save the movie but the character's treatment is so disappointing.\\n\\nOh and almost every reference to the old trilogy is a failure.\\n\\nSo disappointed","true":true}
