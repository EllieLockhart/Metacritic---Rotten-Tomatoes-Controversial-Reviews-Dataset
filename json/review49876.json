Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can pander to an audince and keep the plot you want. Then you can pander to audience so hard you change the plot entirely. The latter is what happened hear. Goodbye football\\, goodbye education\\, goodbye Hollywood\\, goodbye star wars. The liberal agenda ruins everything it touches and they aren't trying to change your mind. They're after your kids minds. Franchise ruined yet again for even worse reasons. White people\\, get ready to watch your children forced into giving up they're homes and money in the future to racism.","true":true}
