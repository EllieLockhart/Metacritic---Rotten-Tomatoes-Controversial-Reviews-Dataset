Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director could not have made a more terrible movie.  All of the suspense and story line from TFA was cast aside.  Rey's personality and journey were gutted.  Luke's character gutted.  No resolution to the mystery of Snoke\\, no character or plot development.  \\n\\nEven the scenes some people say were great\\, such as the throne room battle - sucked!  What lousy choreography.   It's clear to me the reviews that are positive are positive because its Star Wars or they were bought and paid for.","true":true}
