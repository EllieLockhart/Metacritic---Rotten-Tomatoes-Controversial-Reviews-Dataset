Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie ever made. Even worst then the HORRIBLE force awakens. I am not even an original trilogy fan\\, though I think it has the potential to be Imporved on. I loved the prequels and thew clone wars(Best show ever made\\, not kids show minus first season or 2). Which Disney canceled!!! So many problems would take an essay to cover them all. Ray is a marry sue\\, to many modern politics\\, puppet fake looking Yoda\\, Luke gives up\\, light\/dark side totally ignored. And so \\,much more. I would give this no stars if it was possible!!","true":true}
