Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, the film was fun and visually stunning.  While I liked it\\, there were some head scratching decisions made from a storytelling perspective and some missed opportunities\\, the biggest being killing off Luke Skywalker from the series shortly after his big return.  After the death of Han in VII and the forthcoming death or disappearance of Leia in IV due to the loss of Carrie Fisher in real life\\, long time fans are left with none of the original characters they have waited to see return to the big screen.  It's an interesting choice and I think you see this reflected in the low user score for VIII.","true":true}
