Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid fan of Star Wars since 1999\\, when my father carried me into the cinema to watch Episode I with just 1 year\\, I can't express how difficult is for me to dislike an Star Wars film. I really went to see it with high expectations for what I saw at the trailers\\, but the film was nothing like it...\\n\\nThere was a massive amount of comedy\\, which was unnecessary\\, the development of the characters was ugly.\\n\\n Luke was a cranky old man who refused to train a person who desperately need it\\, he refused to help his family in distressed and almost killed his nephew because he felt scared? For real? Is this Luke Skywalker? The one we saw on the Original Trilogy? No\\, it can't\\, it's a joke\\, now I see why Mark Hamill disagreed with Rian Johnson on the script. \\n\\nOn the trailer we saw Luke training Rey when\\, in the movie\\, there was NO TRAINING AT ALL. The Island showing and everything else was a waste of TIME\\, because it added nothing to the plot.\\n\\nSnoke dies in the most stupid way after showing us how amazing his abilities on the dark side were\\, without us knowing who is he... Such a waste of a character. \\n\\nLeia using the force in such a stupid way\\, for real\\, he could've choose a better direction for that situation. \\n\\nThe Casino part was\\, man... the worst of the film\\, it added NOTHING\\, absolutely NOTHING to the plot. The hole Rose and Finn subplot was stupid and bad executed\\, felt forced and unnatural.\\n\\nI'm so sad with the direction the film took. They killed Luke and Snoke on the most stupid way\\, Rey is still a Mary Sue\\, as she still hasn't trained\\, my god...\\n\\nAfter everything JJ gave on Episode VII to Rian to develop and explore: The first jedi temple\\, the foundation of the Jedi Order\\, the balance of the force\\, Rey's parents\\,everything... he just took it and put it directly into the trash. I regret saying  that JJ wasn't enough for Star Wars\\, at least he could've saved the last two episodes and finish the trilogy with the essence of Star Wars...\\n\\nAs I've always said: Star Wars will always be six episodes. George Lucas\\, you're our only hope\\, come back.","true":true}
