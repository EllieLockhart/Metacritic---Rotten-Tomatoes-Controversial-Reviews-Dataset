Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is visually impressive\\, for sure. It also features strong performances (something that does not pass for given in the Star Wars universe). And I feel that I need to say that I am a) not a robot\\, b) not a Donald Trump supporter\\, and c) a longtime Star Wars fan. I really wanted to love this movie\\, and perhaps that is part of the problem. That said\\, it lacks narrative cohesion\\, and I have to agree with folks who have already said that it feels like a reboot (from the Force Awakens\\, no less) that does not really move the larger story forward. Saying that it is worse than Attack of the Clones is a bit harsh\\, but its visual polish does\\, for me at least\\, did not make up for the rather egregious narrative gaps. And Luke milks a space cow.","true":true}
