Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was one of the most disappointing films that I have ever watched in my life time. the plot holes\\, the pointless scenes\\, the horrible acting. force awakens wasn't the best film but set up some good scenarios for the last Jedi but yet disabled Johnson decided to take some ice\/meth and totally ruined up the film. im not a hater. im a fan who has been lover of star wars for over 10 years. I just want to see star wars head in the right direction and become a good as the originals.","true":true}
