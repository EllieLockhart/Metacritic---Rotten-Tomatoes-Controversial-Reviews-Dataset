Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full disclosure\\, I stole this analogy idea from a prior post a few days ago.  I wish I could remember the person's name to give credit for the original analogy\\, but I thought it was funny so I created my own analogy and since The Last Jedi stole most of its story line from prior films\\, I figured why not steal from a prior review for my own:\\n\\nImagine for a moment that Elvis Presley were found alive somewhere in seclusion.  Although he is much older\\, Elvis is still capable of singing and dancing\\, so he agrees to give one final performance for his fans.  Millions of fans who have been missing Elvis for 40 years eagerly buy tickets to see him.  When the show starts\\, instead of a classic rock-and-roll band to open for Elvis\\, the director (we'll call him Ruin Johnson) decides to send out the Jerky Boys to play one of their Prank Call skits.  While the skit might be funny\\, the audience sits puzzled wondering whether the Jerky Boys is an appropriate opening act for an Elvis performance.  Nevertheless\\, the audience remains excited because they are about to see their beloved Elvis.  Then Elvis comes onto stage and a stagehand runs up to him with his guitar\\, which Elvis haphazardly tosses over his shoulder with indifferent disdain.  Elvis proceeds to walk over to the corner of the stage where he milks a cow\\, drinks the milk and then sits down on a bench\\, pulls out a fishing pole and starts griping about past mistakes in life.  \\n\\nNext\\, Ruin Johnson sends out the cast from High School Musical to sing and dance.  The audience knew going into the show that Elvis would have younger backup singers and dancers with him on stage to cater to new fans\\, but they again question whether High School Musical was the right fit for an Elvis performance.  A few older audience members start to look around the room wondering whether other people are enjoying the show when they see a bunch of 10-year-olds with mouths full of popcorn say\\, \\\"we kind of like it.\\\"  Just when the show can't seem to get any worse\\, the anchors of MSNBC take the mic to lecture the audience about political\/social issues for 30 minutes.  Some audience members who did not want to listen to political lectures at Elvis's final performance start to complain\\, but the ushers tell them to shut up and enjoy the exciting bold direction Ruin Johnson has created for Elvis's final performance.  When they complain further they are told they are being racist and sexist because Elvis is a white guy and the cast of High School Musical is more ethnically and gender diverse.   \\n\\nAs a final tease\\, Elvis stands up and walks to the front of the stage and grabs the mic\\, but in actuality it's just a hologram of Elvis and instead of the hologram singing and dancing one of Elvis's greatest hits\\, it jumps around and lip-sinks a Michael Bolton song for 20 seconds before uttering its final words\\, \\\"See Ya Around Kido\\\" and disappears.  Before the audience can standup and leave this hell-hole of a show\\, they see Ruin Johnson pull out a gun and shoot Elvis in the back of the head for no apparent reason.  Then a 7-year-old with no prior musical training\\, puts down a broom and grabs Elvis's guitar as the curtain drops.  \\n\\nThat was the Last Jedi.","true":true}
