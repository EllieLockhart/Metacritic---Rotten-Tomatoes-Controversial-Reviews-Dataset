Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't get much of a tingle at all watching this.  Story was hard to follow\\, lacked any big moments whatsoever\\, and was basically all lack luster and poorly thought out.\\n\\nEDIT:  Rewatched this recently\\, and it's straight garbage.  Honestly never thought I'd watch it again\\, but COVID happened\\, so I'm bored.  The plot makes zero sense\\, there's no payoff whatsoever\\, and then it ends.  This movie is a hot mess.","true":true}
