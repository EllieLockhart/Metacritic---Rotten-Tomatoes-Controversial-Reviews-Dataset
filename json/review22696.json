Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like Skyfall in 007 series some diehard fans won't like how un-Star Wars The Last Jedi is told. But it gives the rejuvenated franchise a refreshing punch into uncharted territory","true":true}
