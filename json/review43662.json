Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was such a huge disappointment. The Last Jedi may be the last Star Wars movie I watch... especially if they are going to be like this in the future.","true":true}
