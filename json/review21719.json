Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just as a master jazz man must steep himself in the rules of music theory before he knows exactly how to make beautiful music that breaks them\\, Rian Johnson's life steeped in Star Wars nerddom has prepared him to create a masterpiece that is at once faithful to the eight films before his\\, yet upends all of their tropes. It's like he spent countless hours reading fan theories on Reddit just so he could shatter them. The Last Jedi is densely packed\\, hilarious throughout\\, and immensely entertaining. Mark Hamill\\, after his long career as a preeminent voice actor\\, gives a tour-de-force (pun intended) performance that he frankly couldn't have managed during the original trilogy. Likewise Andy Serkis as Snoke continues to demonstrate his virtuosity denied almost every tool in an actor's toolkit. Carrie Fisher's final performance made my heart ache\\, as I knew it would. The new cast\\, especially Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver\\, give performances of depth and consequence. Only one complaint: the opening crawl is an iconic part of these films; it merits a proofreader.","true":true}
