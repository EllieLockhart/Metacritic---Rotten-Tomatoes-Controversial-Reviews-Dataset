Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really\\, this was the first movie since Jaws 4 that I walked out of the theater feeling ripped off. Bad Star Wars\\, and just a bad Sci-fi movie as well. Deconstructing the Star Wars mythos and the heroes journey is not what was expected\\, and perhaps not what was wanted by many viewers and fans. I felt the humour was poor\\, out of place and handled with sitcom levels of skill. Not worth a re-watch\\, even for free on TV.","true":true}
