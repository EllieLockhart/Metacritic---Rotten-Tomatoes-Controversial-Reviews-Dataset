Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well.  At least we'll have 4\\, 5\\, & 6 forever.  As Luke said in episode 4\\, \\\"what a piece of junk.\\\"  I could write a book about why this movie was horrible.\\n\\nRidiculous plot armor.  Stupid character arcs that you couldn't give less than a shit about.  Timeless heroes acting in ways completely contradictory to their entire histories.  This movie shits on it all folks.  \\n\\nIt seems social justice warriors won't be happy until they've ruined literally everything.  No stone is left unturned as white male hating writers shove their beliefs in your face so hard that you might gag.  The \\\"diversity quota\\\" is so fucking distracting from the plot\\, which isn't all together a bad thing\\, considering the plot absolutely fucking sucks.  \\n\\nOn the flipside\\, one thing I have to credit the movie for is it's (accidentally) stunningly accurate conclusion.  Let women drive\\, take men out of leadership roles\\, and watch your rebellion drop from thousands of members to ~10.","true":true}
