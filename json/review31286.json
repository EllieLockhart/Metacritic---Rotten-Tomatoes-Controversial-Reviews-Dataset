Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some beautiful scenes but this film is a train wreck!! How DARE you derail Force Awakens in this manner.  This isn't a handful of upset people\\, I know 8 year olds and 12 year olds that all feel the same way.  WHAT. HAVE. YOU. DONE!","true":true}
