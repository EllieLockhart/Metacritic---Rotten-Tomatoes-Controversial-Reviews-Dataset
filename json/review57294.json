Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an emotional roller-coaster ride. \\n\\n* First you are excited.  \\n* Next you start watching it and kind of just like it because its Star Wars.  \\n* You start to notice within about 30 mins the story is really bad and that the whole movie is a really unsubtle left-wing political statement.  \\n* After the movie you walk out\\, kind of happy but shell shocked\\n* Within a few hours you start to think about what you just saw and get really angry\\n* You start reading news articles and film critic reviews about how the movie is a master piece and its a minority of women-hating racist fan boys that hate it - which makes you even angrier.\\n\\nThis movie ruined the franchise\\, I didn't care about fan theories or the 'diverse' cast - I cared that the movie wasn't an escape\\, the story was absolute crap and that Hollywood and the media has raised virtue signalling above honesty. \\n\\nI will never pay to see another Star Wars movie.","true":true}
