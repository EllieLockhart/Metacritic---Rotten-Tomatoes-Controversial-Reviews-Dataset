Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is far worse than any Jar Jar could ever be. I'd rather sit and watch David Attenborough narrate about the love life of the Desert Bantha than to take more of these excruciating hits to my suspension of disbelief. To think that I sacrificed nearly three hours of my life to this unfolding catastrophe of a movie\\, if you even wanna call it that. Will I watch Star Wars 9? Go f**** yourself Disney - you just killed my most precious childhood fantasy universe in a way I'd never even imagined possible. Whoever is responsible for this debacle  in dealing with precious IP is even more incompetent than all the officers of rebellion and first order combined.","true":true}
