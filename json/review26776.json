Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On a scale of awesome-meh-disappointment this movie falls solidly between the meh-disappoint range. I could list many things that are wrong with the film but don't want to add any spoilers. Just know Luke was talking to the audience when he said \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think it is.\\\" I understand Disney wants to focus the direction of these movies away from the heroic journey\\, but this movie is very nihistic and it didn't need to be.","true":true}
