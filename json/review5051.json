Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to add this rating. I'm not one of those guys who hates on all the Star Wars movies\\, I thought all of them including Rogue One and The Force Awakens but this\\, this was just terrible. Plot holes abound\\, Times were they try and be super realistic then in the next scene they act completely silly. I was expecting the world out of this movie and now I'm honestly scared of the direction they'll go next. I never thought I'd say this but I think they killed Star Wars with this one and Guardians of the Galaxy was reborn. I was hoping for fresh and exciting and what I got was a storyline that completely bashed in anyone's skull who had ever been a fan in the last 30 years. I'm a grown man and had a bad day over thinking about the leave of stupidity in this movie at work today. Hope you reading this has a better experience with this movie than I did.","true":true}
