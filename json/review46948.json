Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We was so excited to see this film\\, but you killed the core of star wars. There is so many things that was left in the air from the 7th film...\\n\\nWe grew up with...what will Luke do\\, how will he react or do.. You broke the IDEA of skywalkers... I will not raise my kids to be hard core star wars  fans like I was if you don't fix this in the next film.  Hope you listen to us and create a masterpiece in episode 9. \\n\\nMay the force be with you\\, because your going to need it!","true":true}
