Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before anything about this movie\\, The Force Awakens was one of my favorite movies in the franchise\\, but this movie was an absolute disaster. If you like pretty visuals and some comedy\\, its decent\\, but if you care anything about how a movie should tell a coherent story\\, this is a disgrace. I am versed in Star Wars canon and how events and people are related\\, and this was utterly confusing and disjointed. The movie drops the ball on every chance to give the audience a meaningful payoff\\, and leaves me wondering why they even made it.","true":true}
