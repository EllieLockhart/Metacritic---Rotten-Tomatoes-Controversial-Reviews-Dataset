Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was fine. Not as good as the last one. It seemed cheesier than usual and I found lots of the scenes to be pointless. I did like the stuff between Kylo and Rey. Adam Driver is still awesome. Ice puppies are OK. Benicio del Toro was also very good. Generally too much of nothing happened.","true":true}
