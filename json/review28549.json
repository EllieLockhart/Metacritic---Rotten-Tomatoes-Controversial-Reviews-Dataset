Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the 3rd or 4th best SW film ever! Empire clearly #1. In the mix w\/ Return of the Jedi and Rogue One. I love Rian Johnson and how he opened up future story lines. Must see movie for sure! I'll go watch it another 2-3 times!","true":true}
