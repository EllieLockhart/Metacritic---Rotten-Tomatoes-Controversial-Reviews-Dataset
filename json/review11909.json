Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment! The plot is extremely weak and predictable with unnecessary cheesy scenes. If you are a fan of Star Wars you will hate this. The movie feels long and by the end of it you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth. \\n\\nThe  only thing that is worth looking at is the amazing visual effects. The visuals look stunning! I would describe it as going to the top of a mountain to look at the beautiful sceneray \\, butt naked at -20 degrees. That's how this movie feels like.","true":true}
