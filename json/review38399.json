Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie of the year in my opinion. The story line is weak and has a lot of loop holes. The movie is kind of sexist too. [spoiler alert] If you didn't notice most of the good rebel generals and commanders in the movie are women while the men are mostly the bad guys getting blown up. Luke's training of the Jedi chick was a 3-step lesson and it took him a day or two; all of a sudden\\, the chic is all powerful and the universe's only hope. If I recall correctly from the original movies\\, it took luke a while to even get the basics of the force and he didn't even finish his training. The critics must have been paid to give this movie a 93% because otherwise it does not make sense. Disney has managed to destroy george lucas' legacy with this two poorly made movies.","true":true}
