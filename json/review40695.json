Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This last episode has completely ruined Star Wars for me. The acting was poor\\, plot holes everywhere\\, forced input of SJW agenda.\\nThe fact that the tomatometer rates it so high is just another fact that shoes how disconnected and in their Hollywood leftist bubble these movie critics are compared to the real fans.","true":true}
