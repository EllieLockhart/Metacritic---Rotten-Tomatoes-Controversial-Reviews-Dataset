Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing. As an avid Star Wars fan\\, I can see some of the cheekiness not being for everyone. But let me tell you I was 100 percent thrilled with the entire ride.\\n\\nEach sequence with Luke was done brilliantly. \\n\\nThe Rae and Kylo Ren scenes were perfect and the late Carrie Fisher stole the show.\\n\\nThe action sequences were perfect and in true form to Star Wars.\\n\\nI can easily say I will watch this another 20+ times.","true":true}
