Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From beginning to end\\, the most emotionless Star Wars movie I ever watched in my life. Sorry\\, let me correct that; there was disgust and disappointment all over my face. I will cherish Episodes 4-6 any day\\, and I'll praise the prequels over this movie any time. Ruined OT characters\\, basically destroyed what fans wanted to see and shoehorn PC stuff. Please don't ever let Rian Johnson direct or write any Star Wars movie ever again. This movie was bold\\, yes\\, but on all wrong places.","true":true}
