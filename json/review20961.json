Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was happy with it and liked it more than the Force Awakens. No spoilers here so I\u2019m keeping it short. I think negative reviews are too hard on it.","true":true}
