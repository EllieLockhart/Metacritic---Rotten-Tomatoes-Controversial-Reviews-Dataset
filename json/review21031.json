Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was prepared for this movie to be better than The Force Awakens.  Loved Rogue One and can watch it over and over.  Unfortunately\\, The Last Jedi disappoints.\\n\\nThanks for ruining this movie with yet more social justice warrior bullsheet.  Female leadership is front and center.  This isn't the kind of empowered leadership you saw from Margaret Thatcher or even young Princess Leah.  Instead we see the kind of condescending\\, nagging\\, and emasculating feminism that has led The Resistance right off the cliff.  At this point\\, The Resistance deserves to die along with awful final trilogy.  There are no characters worth watching or rooting for now that Luke is gone.  Dismantle R2\\, decommission '3PO\\, euthanize Chewie.  It's over.  They have finally killed my childhood.  I look forward to a reboot of the entire franchise in an alternate timeline if somebody can buy the rights away from Disney.  \\n\\nBy the way\\, you can''t outrun an enemy fleet that has sufficient fuel to jump ahead of you  with a blocking force.  I'm no 'general' but I do know traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops.  Two stars for watching them pick off the rebel scum like ducks.  Well done there.  Also fun watching Luke school Kylo.","true":true}
