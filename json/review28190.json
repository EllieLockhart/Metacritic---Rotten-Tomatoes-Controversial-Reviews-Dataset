Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly directed hodgepodge of unlikable characters that left me yawning when they were killed off. Old and new heroes are disappointing with none getting to be heroes. Snoke\\, the best villain since Vader\\, is a little used inigma. I fully expect Disney to trot Billy Dee Williams out next time and have him fall break a hip and die.","true":true}
