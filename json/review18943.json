Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's awful and I registered just for this\\nNegatives: \\n- Lore and characters disrespected\\n- Boring new cast\\, got worse from TFA\\n- Humor: No you're not funny\\n- The story goes nowhere\\, no explanations\\, no background\\, no build up\\, to many twists for the sake of being twisty  - in the end it was the same minus a few thousand rebels and two main characters. \\n- Lots of really good and meaningful story opportunities missed. \\n\\nPositive: \\n+ Audiovisuals\\n\\nToo bad I can't get a refund. \\n\\nOh and censoring 1\/2 stars when your new? Seriously? Are you thath low?","true":true}
