{"101487":178739,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a lot of great cinematic moments in this movie\\, like the throne room fight\\, hyperspace kamikaze\\, and the ending with Luke. There were also great character moments\\, like the interactions between Rey and Kylo\\, and Luke and Leia's interaction at the end was pretty much perfect.\\n\\nThe world building was OK. I'd say better than TFA\\, but not as good as Rogue One. The Casino sequence\\, while utterly unnecessary to the plot (serious\\, the entire Finn love interest thing was just not good...) introduced us to a side of the galaxy we hadn't seen. The \\\"1%ers\\\" of the galaxy living in classy space Vegas was unique\\, and I liked that new look and feel that added diversity to the types of planets we've seen\\, while TFA felt more like rehashes of what we'd seen before. The salt planet at the end was\\, likewise\\, a new and interesting planet that wasn't too similar to things we'd seen before.\\n\\nBut...\\n\\nSo. Many. Logistical. Issues. Probably the type of things the average viewer won't think about\\, but to a diehard Star Wars fan with a good knowledge for how \\\"things work\\\" in the Star Wars universe\\, there were just so many inconsistencies with the rules they've established within the other films\\, or even the ones they established earlier in this one. \\n\\n1. I expected to see the Republic army\/armada. I expected to see them get their asses handed to them handedly\\, but I still expected to see them. But they're basically acting like the whole republic\\, their military and their government\\, was wiped out from a single shot from Starkiller Base. Even if the republic DID park their entire military in one system\\, which would make protecting and policing the galaxy impossible\\, none of the individual systems have their own ships? It's literally down to those three Resistance ships aaaaaand they're gone. They really wanted to have the \\\"scrappy underdogs vs huge army\\\" feel back\\, but in accomplishing that\\, they wiped away the victory from the original series. All the deaths\\, Vader being redeemed\\, and basically all of RotJ is irrelevant because they want an underdog story again. The prequels\\, with their faults\\, at least added to the story and universe. The sequels actually make the \\\"point\\\" of the original series moot. It actually makes RotJ worse\\, because you know everything goes back to \\\"everything is bad\\\" 2 episodes later.\\n2. That chase sequence was just ill conceived for so many reasons. The First Order only has those three star destroyers\\, and can't just send ships to cut them off? No Star Wars equivalent of a spike strip? (They're called Ion Cannons btw...)  One of the three ships chasing them couldn't use lightspeed to go ahead of them\\, then come from the other side? Also\\, there is no resistance in space\\, so you don't need to constantly burn fuel. Once you reach top speed\\, you will keep traveling at that speed. You'd just need one burst of the engines\\, then just coast. I'll let that one slide\\, though\\, since that's a consistent thing in Star Wars\\, at least. \\n3. Poe and Finn's plan never could have worked. They had 18 hours of fuel\\, and lightspeed travel HAS to take more fuel than regular thrusters. By the time Finn got back\\, they were on fumes. They should not have been able to go into hyperspace BUT THEN THEY DID ANYWAY when they ram the Star Destroyer. \\n4.Why didn't the Vice Admiral just tell Poe her plan? It would have saved lives. Why didn't she just ram Snoke's ship as soon as it arrived? It's the Supreme leader\\, when is there going to be a better use for your last rickety ship? \\n5. Surviving the vacuum of space? Just no.\\n6. Who is Snoke? He has Force Lightning and appears more powerful than Palpatine\\, but we have no idea how. Who trained him? How did Kylo come to serve him? I hope there are some flashbacks in IX that explain all that.\\n\\nLastly\\, I do like Rose. I do not like that Arc. It felt like they wanted to back away from a Finn\/Rey romance\\, so they introduce this cliche character for him to hook up with. \\\"Free the animals!\\\" \\\"Save what you love!\\\" OK Mary Sue.","true":true}
