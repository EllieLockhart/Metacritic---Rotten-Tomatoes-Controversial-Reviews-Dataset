Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it 3 times and letting the story really soak in... the movie does a huge disservice to the franchise with the direction they took Luke.  It feels like an entire movie is missing showing us Luke Skywalker the Jedi master in his prime.","true":true}
