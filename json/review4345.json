Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't fully express how awful this was. So bad in every way. I want to give it 0 stars. Plot made no sense. New characters were hateable. Humors tone was way off and felt like it was written by a middle schooler. Tried a few viewings to find something I liked\\, and got nothing. ","true":true}
