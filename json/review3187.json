Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful film great acting shame about missing storyline and awful plot holes. Underdeveloped characters and the whole lack lustre canto bite arc. Such a shame this film really did turn to the dark side. One star because it was entertaining on first viewing but then you leave the film with niggles that quickly turn to wtf have they done. Cheap and lazy.","true":true}
