Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a bit of a dumpster fire.\\n\\nIt is a plot hole-ridden space adventure that does very little to advance the storyline while still managing to waste an inordinate amount of time. The first half of the film is almost entirely a time-sink for the main cast- running off on a useless side quest that could have easily been avoided with a single conversation. In the latter half\\, characters act predictably and don't exhibit many signs of growth or meaningful change. This comes as a disappointment for those who predicted Ben Solo and Rey would be faced with more than a binary choice between good or evil.\\n\\nDialogue is clumsy\\, several jokes aren't well timed or did not land with the audience\\, and exposition is delivered in a way that really patronizes the viewer.\\n\\nThere are a few fleeting moments of fan-pandering that will rouse a cheer from the theatre and one of the most brilliant shots in the history of VFX space battles\\, though ultimately this entry in the series will fall flat for many.\\n\\nIt is still an entertaining\\, albeit campy\\, sci-fi popcorn flick about space wizards dueling with laser swords\\, but don't be surprised when you hear people debating whether this Star Wars even deserves a spot in the top five films of the franchise. I suspect it will barely eke out in front of the prequel trilogy for some fans.","true":true}
