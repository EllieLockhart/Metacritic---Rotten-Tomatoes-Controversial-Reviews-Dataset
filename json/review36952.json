Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was made beautifully\\, except the script was absolutely horrible. Where even the Prequel Trilogy and Rogue One added to the lore of Star Wars\\, no matter how many people hated the PT\\, this follow up to TFA was dismally disappointing\\, and the farthest thing from a Star Wars movie I could imagine. It's watchable\\, including the stupid jokes and meaningless sub-stories\\, character additions\/development for no other reason than appealing to a wider Disney multi-cultural audience\\, and obviously contradictions (like why does Finn's Ski Speeder guns melt under the super ray stream while his face does not?) but if I ever watch this again\\, i'll watch it with the sound OFF and the John Williams Soundtrack ON. Mark Hamill is a wonderful actor and I loved his own mental adjustment as this version of Luke in the movie as actually and entity known as \\\"Jake Skywalker\\\" ...if I use that same reasoning\\, it's a ok movie\\, just not Star Wars. Rather \\\"Journal of the Jakes\\\" or \\\"The Last Jake\\\"","true":true}
