{"101487":135495,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jedi was a major disappointment. The forced humor often fell flat\\, and the first half of the movie\\, sans a few scenes\\, felt listless and dull. While it stepped things up in the second half (after the surprising but also disappointing scene with Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Snoke)\\, it just wasn't enough to save it. There were so many plot holes and contrivances\\, characters acting out of character\\, and -- although Star Wars has never been known for its adherence to space physics -- over-the-top ridiculous space scenes (\\\"dropping\\\" bombs on a starship in zero gravity\\, \\\"bullet drop\\\" physics when firing in space\\, and of course the Force somehow overcoming the cold vacuum of space). Rose was a wasted character\\, and Finn and Poe felt neutered in their roles. Not to mention Rian Johnson felt the need to interject social issues from this galaxy into this other one far\\, far away. Star Wars is about escapism into sci-fi fantasy; it doesn't need to lecture us on the politics of war or animal abuse. The only real upside to the movie was Rey and Kylo's character arcs. But that seemed weighed down with the overlong space chase (starships running out of fuel? oh no ... they'll simply maintain that same speed indefinitely) that resulted in the the deaths of almost every Rebel because Admiral Holdo couldn't be bothered to share her plan with any of the crew. Count me as not a fan of Rian Johnson's work here\\, and I'm glad J.J. Abrams is taking the reigns back to close out the sequel trilogy. Not so happy about Rian getting creative control over an entirely new trilogy down the line though.","true":true}
