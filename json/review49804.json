Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes I am a die hard Star Wars fan and enjoyed this movie. The complaints I\u2019m reading about make zero sense to me at all. I\u2019ll leave it at that and hope that people will understand the direction it\u2019s going in on a second viewing which I am very much looking forward to doing very soon!","true":true}
