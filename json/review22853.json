Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time fan here. It was a decent movie but left thinking this was all a dream and Rey is going to wake up in episode 9 and start all over. The Mary Poppins Leia out in space was odd. It also felt like they slapped Abrams in the face a few times by taking his movie and making it for not. In the end it was a different take on a story. I liked it but didn't love it.","true":true}
