Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful shots and maybe some solid acting\\, but the writing is a mess - literally makes no sense if you take two seconds to ponder and taken as part of the series\/universe it reads like a comic instead rather than real life it so unconnected. Every decision that could be taken to make it dumber and more simplistic the writers took. The characters minus maybe kylo are flat as you can imagine. Rey is just a magic unrealistic mess with no connection to scavenger rough edges no parent back story. The other characters are so one dimensional it hurts. Nothing makes sense. Literally Nothing.\\n\\nI can do this here but not here.\\n\\nHorrible horrible horrible script!!!! No direction. No story telling. Lazy writing. Read likes a filler episode from a tv series\\, the series writes out later on as a dream or a alternate universe rather than keep it in the story arch.","true":true}
