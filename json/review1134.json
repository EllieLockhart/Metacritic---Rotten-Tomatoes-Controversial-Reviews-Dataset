{"101487":104361,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone else drag their feet before going to see Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi based on fan complaints and mixed reviews?  I went to see it today... and I will beat around the bush no further; The film BLOWS - YOU AWAY.  I could write on and on and counter each and  every complaint I read with specific points to the contrary\\, or simplify it; the people who complained are idiots.  \\n\\nI had read so many things that lead me to believe that Alas\\, Disney took a while but inevitably got around to successfully destroying the Star was franchise that I (we) so love.  That couldn't be further from the truth. I admit\\, I've been pessimistic since Disney Bought the franchise and although there is still time\\, I am happy to report that they have NOT ruined Star Wars  (yet). So far I have to admit they've done an amazing job and this film\\, like Empire\\, is better than it's former kick off\\, The The Force Awakens\\, and although there are serious parallels to Empire - NOTHING is as it seems or goes formulaic other than the premise of Empire; the rebels are on the run from a super charged (and super angry) \\\"First Order\\,\\\" and there is an attempt to procure and \\\"turn\\\" someone to the Dark side.  Other than that\\, nothing in this film is like anything else you've seen and it doesn't go how you'd expect it to. It challenges your mind with twists and turns you're not expecting. It's different\\, original\\, taut\\, swift\\, bold and brave\\, -yet completely unmistakably identifiably\\, and categorically\\, STAR WARS.  \\n\\nTo say that the film exceeded my expectations\\, is an understatement.  Just when I thought this film would be more whiny Adam Driver (go back to Hot Topic you low rent\\, incompetent wanna be Vader with daddy issues) and more absurdly over powered Rey - and no Harrison Ford to save the film\\, - Instead I got a surprise. A Big One. The film is taut\\, fresh\\, compelling\\, convincing. It keeps moving\\, and despite the 2 1\/2 hour length\\, It never seemed sluggish or boring. The dialogue is SO good.  The comedy moments are reminiscent from the original trilogy and are much needed.  It's not over done. It's natural and human. You can identify\\, and it's wonderful that they've kept the tongue and cheek comedy moments and comments alive... there are several moments where the comedic dialogue reminds you of\\, \\\"one thing's for sure\\, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.\\\"  It's fresh\\, clever and subtle but like the rest of the differences it's unmistakably Star Wars. Dare I say\\, the film is better ... than Empire Strikes Back. Yes I know\\, and I said it. Adam Driver has left Hot Topic and is his own menace. Still no Vader\\, but he's getting there quickly and in some ways more effective as there is new depth and complexity to the evil.  I can't recall the last time I laughed and cried AND wanted to stand up and cheer with applause.  Had it been opening weekend\\, I would have. However\\, I drug my feet based on \\\"mixed reviews\\\" and my own fear of being severely disappointed.  \\n\\nRegarding the stand up and cheer moments - (there is more than one)...I don't want to give a bunch of plot spoilers\\, but on a final note\\, I have to say one of the stand up and cheer moments is the \\\"Leia moment.\\\"  It is a triumphant\\, unexpected beautiful moment that will WOW you and perhaps make you tear-up\\, and want to cheer. It's a resounding and triumphant YES!  Brilliant and bold. Unexpected yet completely plausible (in the Star Wars universe).  If you are dragging your feet (like I was) and thinking about waiting to see it on DVD.  DON'T. This film needs to be experienced\\, seen and heard -on a Massive screen with a bad ass sound system. (We went to the Cinerama which I highly recommend).  The cinematography\\, battle scenes and vivid imagery are beyond compare. (The ATAT scenes on the salt planet are like Hoth on steroids.) It's not Gone With The Wind. It's not the second coming of Jesus Christ. But it's hands down one of the best films I have ever seen. And\\, in my opinion\\, the best of ALL the Star Wars movies. (Yes\\, it's even better than Empire).","true":true}
