We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"People review bombing no way beat the game real people like us are just now beating the game now and it took a solid 2-3 day and nights straight to do so\\, I feel like my heart's strings have never been pulled harder and people jumping at spoilers to make judgements have no clue. This game gave me heavy resident evil vibes in the best way that the first never truly pulled off. The boss fight with Abby was straight out of RE:Nemesis and maybe Im the outlier here in that by my time was over with Abby I DID empathize with her SO strongly and honestly at the final fight let her kill Ellie just to see if there was a cannon ending for that. I really was not expecting to like Abby and from the first day in Seattle with her it felt like a slog but something about her\\, maybe the voice acting\\, maybe the ultra hard shielding around her heart that she had so strongly that made her so Hateable for many\\, but Relatable to me. We all love Ellie because we saw her grow up\\, and I know it was intentional writing\\, but Ellie pissed me off more than once and it's because I was really close to a few girls who acted just like that. Abby showed multiple times a certain restraint and maturity that Ellie couldn't understand untill she literally lost the ability to play her favorite tune. It was tragic. I truly was surprised myself that by the end I wanted them both to win\\, though I knew they had already both losses\\, so\\, so long ago. It was a masterpiece. And many people may never know it\\, they will judge this game off many other things\\, and the gameplay itself is superb in stealth and A.I.Once again I wonder or possibly doubt it's even possible for them to continue this story again\\, especially with Ellie. But I have absolute faith and excitement for anything that may come. At the deepest expense of my emotional reserves. The HBO show that supposedly is happening could potentially turn this into something even greater. But as it stands\\, this is another turning point in video game narrative\\, and the the risks may have been obvious\\, (especially living in a post Game of Thrones world) I think we can all agree that the execution was nearly flawless and The Last of Us 2 has stuck it's landing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
