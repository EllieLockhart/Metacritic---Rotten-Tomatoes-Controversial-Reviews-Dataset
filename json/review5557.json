Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did anyone else wonder why Poe and Rey introduced themselves to each other when they were clearly standing next to each other in 'The Force Awakens' when Fin was being rushed off to get medical treatment? Really just seems like Rian Johnson did not watch 'Awakens' or perhaps any of the previous films. I think everything else has been said about this mistake - oh\\, what is the point of spaceships that can't change direction (the bombers) and planes that can't fly (those dumb sand sprayers at the end)? Also\\, how about developing the new characters from Awakens\\, before introducing a bunch of newer and more annoying ones.","true":true}
