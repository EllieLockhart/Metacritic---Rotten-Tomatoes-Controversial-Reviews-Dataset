Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's painfully obvious that they changed the director for this one\\, Rian Johnson wasn't able to create a smooth transition into his own script and ideas. Not that a smooth transition would have fixed the awkward misplaced humor (the milk scene really?) and some of the sudden personality changes (Poe and Luke).The only reason I'm giving this 1.5 stars is because the ending fight scene was fantastic and really makes me think that 9 could bring the trilogy back.","true":true}
