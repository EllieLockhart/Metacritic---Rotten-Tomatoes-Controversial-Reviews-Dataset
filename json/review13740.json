Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I wanted to see current political views I would just turn on the news! Thank you Disney for severely damaging a great STAR WARS franchise. No wonder Hollywood isn't doing so well? I also like all the critics banding together to dismiss what fans have to say.","true":true}
