Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is beautiful\\, but the story decisions are horrid. Probably the worst story driven game I have played in a very long time. The lack of consciousness by the development team is shocking. Instead of playing a story driven game\\, you play a vendetta and revenge story line that lacks because of the characters surrounding you. Then\\, you make me not able to finish that vendetta... You ruin both characters from the first game in this disgrace of a sequel. Atrocious decisions by this development team who honesty should not work on another Naughty Dog story game ever again. The gameplay isn\u2019t the best because you\u2019re searching for collectibles more than playing the story most of the time which is probably why they put so many of them in the game to distract you from probably the worst writing and development of a 2nd installment ever. This game should serve as a catalyst on how to ruin one of the best video games ever made. I am honestly shocked Sony gave the green light to release this after someone read this horrible script and plot. So many flaws and horrible decisions you\u2019ll be baffled. There were so many ways they could have built a fantastic second installment\\, but this game falls flat within the first hour. If you want to play a great game and don\u2019t care about getting mad about the story it\u2019s a good buy. The game is average and worth a buy once it\u2019s on sale. If you\u2019re going to get upset and break a controller\\, you can surmise what they did and watch the 25+ hour waste of time on YouTube or Twitch.Graphics 10\/10Gameplay 6\/10Combat 7\/10Sound 10\/10Music 10\/10Realism 10\/10Level Design 10\/10Story\/Plot 0\/10Character development 0\/10Writing 0\/10Worst ending in a AAA game ever 10\/10How to ruin a franchise 10\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
