Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really killed the franchise. Im not a bot or racist\\, its plain and simple: terrible script and story that disrespected the beloved characters and lore of Star Wars and destroyed everything that came before it.  Really ruined any hype I had for Solo. How on earth did this thing get approved? No\\, I didnt care for the story to go a certain way as they claim.  This movie is pretty incredible in a way\\, it single handedly destroys everything special about Star Wars and makes long time huge fans want to never see any future installments or buy any new merchandise. Solo clearly suffered as a result (not a bad movie BTW) and episode 9\\, I have no idea how they could turn it around but Im not excited for it because this film left nothing to look forward to. 9 is probably dead on arrival. Disney\\, you really screwed the pooch on this one. A lot of people feel the same way and are pretty angry at how the PR responded about our outrage.","true":true}
