Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not worth anything because it's got a lot of pointless plots\\, no character development\\, it adds political aspects and shoves it down your throat. This is not starwars over doing the feminist idea to a pint of making any sense to decisions just had to add the political aspect even if it ruins the story. Makes Luke's character pathetic\\, last Rei is still a perfect or more perfect in the fact her flaws are severely miner and she doesn't earn any character progression.","true":true}
