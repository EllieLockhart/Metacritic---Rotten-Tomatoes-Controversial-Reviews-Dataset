{"101487":138717,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I rated The Last Jedi exactly in the middle because this movie is exactly in the middle of good and bad. Really\\, it\u2019s incredibly mediocre. A great movie for 9 year olds. But anyone who has ever read a great story book\\, seen a great movie\\, watched a great television drama\\, or experienced any other form of great storytelling is going to feel let down. Some of the scenes are incredible. Some of the developments are amazing. But others are totally flat\\, with no real attempt to bring them to life. Take Kylo Ren; his character is wonderfully more nuanced and layered in The Last Jedi as opposed to The Force Awakens. You feel the conflict within him\\, and it is immensely compelling. Contrast that with Rey; her character is wasted\\, right down to her anticlimactic parentage (if that was even true or not\\, I can\u2019t tell). She starts out the movie delivering the canned script of a telemarketer\\, asking Luke to come back with her\\, he\u2019s their only hope\\, blah blah blah\\, and her canned lines and character only plateaus from that underwhelming introduction. We don\u2019t know why she is so connected to the Force. We don\u2019t know why she is connected to Luke or Ren. We don\u2019t know why any of this matters to her\\, or why she matters to the Galaxy or the story. Only that she\u2019s a great Jedi. Yay? Furthermore\\, Poe\u2019s character is utterly wasted. Finn\u2019s character is utterly wasted. Even time honored characters like Leia\\, C-3PO or R2-D2 are wasted. It\u2019s almost like they are needless baggage along for a meandering ride to nowhere. All of Poe\u2019s plot is fruitless and pointless in the end. Finn\u2019s story could be cut from the whole movie\\, and you\u2019d never notice it was gone. Leia was in a coma for most of the movie\\, and that pretty much describes how compelling her story was. 3PO and R2 aren\u2019t comic relief\\, just annoying add-ins that have to be there\\, because\\, um\\, tradition? But then\\, we have Luke\u2019s character. Interesting motivation\\, philosophical dilemma\\, personal soul-searching\\, troubled by mistakes and regrets\\, Luke is developed well\\, right to the end battle with Ren. But\\, yet again\\, Snoke\u2019s character. We start out not knowing who he is\\, what his motives are\\, where he comes from\\, why he\u2019s so powerful\\, how did he come to control the shattered Empire...and then\\, he dies. Um\\, really? Wait\\, is he going to Force-resurrect? Anytime here? Um\\, wait\\, what just happened?!?! I feel like this movie had a great plot that was merged with no plot at all\\, and hence there is a hybrid of good and terrible. And it\u2019s horribly unbalanced\\, not at all like the balance of the Light and the Dark. It just comes across as really confusing and jumbled\\, and you leave the movie with more disappointment than satisfaction.","true":true}
