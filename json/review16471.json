Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sure others have said to expect the unexpected. But\\, it is true. Rian Johnson's \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is just a down right amazing movie. With great performances by the cast\\, amazing visuals\\, a long with some  twists\\, turns\\, and down right spectacular action. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" does it job in entertaining\\, and expands upon the universe. The movie does things that have not been done before in Star Wars. This includes showing us force abilities that haven't been explored in any of the Star Wars movies.  Also\\, there was speculation that this will just be a \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" remake. And while it does have  that similar feel\\, it is in no way a remake of ESB.  It does have plot points that should have been included. Plot points in regards to characters like Snoke for example. Other than that\\, the movie is just a fun Star Ware adventure. As long as you don't go into this movie with high expectations and crazy fan theories then\\, one should be able to just enjoy.","true":true}
