Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't have time to read the whole review here's the bottom line: go and enjoy it\\, as a movie NOT a\\nnot a religion.\\n\\nExpected to hate it. they messed with Luke skywalker... it was long... I wanted more action..  i liked it anyway!  My biggest concern was that they would let fans or current culture ruin the unique Star Wars universe\\, and that did not happen. The Last Jedi creatively stands on its own.  Effects were awesome and seamless. Mark Hamil had fun. Carrie Fisher was great. New Characters are solid.  Reserve the word \\\"canon\\\" for the Bible and let the movie happen. Johnson and team worked hard to connect generations. Yes there were plot holes\\, however the last time I looked\\, it was Star Wars 8 not Citizen Kane. Disney wins at the box office. All the basement dwellers will see this movie three times (even if it is just to complain to each other). New fans will own the new direction and enjoy it. People my age will connect with people thirty years younger over it.  Star Wars is more popular in American culture than Santa Claus now\\, so there's no way everyone will be happy with each piece.  Juust go and have a good time with it. The Last Jedi was a good addition to an epic series.","true":true}
