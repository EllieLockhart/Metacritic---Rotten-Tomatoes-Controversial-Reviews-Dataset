Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great. It was surprising\\, thoughtful and deep. It has one of the best lightsaber fights in the entire franchise\\, a starship moment that made the entire audience gasp\\, creatures around long enough to be cute but not get annoying\\, characters who made big decisions instead of having the plot happen to them\\, and stakes that haven't felt as high since the Empire Strikes Back.  \\n\\nI agree with the professional critics\\, and I don't get the dislike of this movie.  Just because you don't like what happens is not a reason to hate the movie. People didn't like that Han was frozen in carbonite\\, either.","true":true}
