Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is a bad Star Wars movie and also just a really bad movie. It was the first time in my life I thought about leaving the cinema before the end. Star Wars 8 is what I would call a Non-Movie. 142 painful minutes where nothing\\, nothing and nothing happen. I will give anybody 1 hour and they will come up with a scenario 100 times better than that\\, I mean... if we can call the Rian Johnson scenario a scenario...\\nI won't make the list of all the other bad things (that just kill the star wars myth) happening in the movie\\, such as the casting\\, the jokes\\, the horses destroying capitalism\\, Luke\\, the bad guys.. a lot of people already did it well.. And what can we say from all the media saying great things about it?? To say Justice League is bad movie (yes it was a bad movie) everybody is here\\, but to say the real truth about the worst movie ( ST8) ever made since a long time nobody is here...","true":true}
