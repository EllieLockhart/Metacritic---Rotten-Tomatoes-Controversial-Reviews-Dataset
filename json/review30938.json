Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed\\, less plot holes and more character development in something on Pornhub.\\n\\nThe acting and cinematography were great\\, but as a Star Wars film\\, it was not. It makes me not even look forward to any of the future films and spin offs. Two years ago we had a \\\"good\\\" film that set some solid grounding a base for the lead characters. I was hoping to learn more about them and see some new powers and combat from Luke... Learning more about Snoke and his past... instead got 2 hours of lens flare and explosions.?","true":true}
