Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As disappointed as I am\\, I'm not surprised--especially after the last two films. This one was sickeningly preachy (to ignore the various artistic problems). It's really sad (but\\, again\\, unsurprising) to see all these critics toe the party line in giving favorable reviews to this sordid propaganda piece.","true":true}
