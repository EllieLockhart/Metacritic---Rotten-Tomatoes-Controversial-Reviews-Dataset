Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a good movie overall\\,if you HAVEN'T seen  any of the other movies you would have liked it but if you have seen all the movies like me the unexpected deaths are a little derailing  and will cause some of you to quit the series.","true":true}
