Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cool visuals\\, poor story.\\nGlaring plot holes and a crappy side plot with finn and rose pretty much killed the movie.\\nSnoke was worthless.\\nFirst Order could have just  used Hyperdrive to go out to the side and then to infront of the rebels thus ending the very dumb 18 hour or so chase in minutes\\, movie over\\, everyone is dead. Rian destroyed what J.J. started with TFA. This whole oooo anyone can be Jedi thing\\, WE ALREADY FREAKING KNEW THAT\\, has anyone ever seen the jedi from the prequals? They came from all over. You're only getting the 1 star because of the visuals\\, the story was worthless.","true":true}
