Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DONT TRUST ROTTONTOMATOES REVIEWS!! these \\\"critics\\\" were definitely purchased. eff Disney for ruining star wars and killing good characters. bullshit....and what happened to real high adrenaline lightsaber battles. All disney is doing is trying to make you like the new characters by killing off the old ones in a sad way but it wont work. Star wars is star wars because of mark hamel carrie fisher  harrison ford Etc. I thought i like this bullshit but the motives of this company is to obvious and intolerable its sickening. stop milking star wars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
