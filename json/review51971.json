Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh take on the series that admittedly had a few missteps. Though not enough missteps to garner the hatred it's gotten from a lot of people\\, in my opinion. This movie makes me exited for the third and final film in the trilogy\\, which is exactly what one should want from this second installment.","true":true}
