Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cringeworthy. In the middle of that trainwreck of a film\\, Leia sends a destress signal to the Galaxy\\, and no one cares... you now what\\, at the end of movie\\, I didn't care either. \\n\\nWhy are they fighting for? It should be a simple question in a movie... is it for freedom? is it for democracy? is it to free some random heard? We know nothing about snoke (and that will remain so)\\, nothing about why does the new republic that won in the ROTJ needs to be defended by a resistance and not an army (probably to look more of an underdog\\, the \\\"ragtag\\\" thing works better for plot sake\\, even if it doesn't make any sense I guess)\\, what drives emo Vader into a galaxy conflict\\, more so now that he doesn't have nobody to follow? (at least george lucas gave us a sob but understandable story for anikin to follow palpatine and kill every jedi he could find). Rey fights because she can\\, but doesn't strike me as very concerned about the well being of the galaxy... she just wants\\, you know\\, \\\"to know her place\\\"... Luke doesn't care either\\, he is milking aliens and burning books... and that's one of the problems with these main characters\\, it's all about them (in a very uninteresting way)... so\\, why should we care? wasn't this a War? What are the sides now? an annoying emo vs 20 guys and five porgs?","true":true}
