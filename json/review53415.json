Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney and Rian Johnson bring you a visually pleasing cluster**** of a film that pays little to no respect to the other movies in the franchise. Completely takes a dump on classic characters. Massive plot holes. Clear SJW agenda and prominent feminist tones throughout the entire movie. All cgi is utterly useless except for Disney to market crap toys. Puppet Yoda looked like he came out of th Clone Wars cartoon. Luke was turned into a cuck. Leia can suddenly fly through space using the force even though she has only ever been force sensitive and not a user. Finn and the Asian chick are completely filler..their role in this movie has no direct impact on the plot at all. Snoke was offed like nothing. No character development whatsoever. The casino thing? Don't even get me started. I could go on and on but I digress...it hurts me to be so disappointed in a Star Wars movie. Disney literally just wants your money this movie is literally a cash grab that feeds off of nostalgia.","true":true}
