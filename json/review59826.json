There are facets of the game that further support this idea i.e giving the player no agency in morally reprehensible or bankrupt decisions; this comes off as trying to convince the player that this is \u201cthe dark hatred game\u201d which is incredibly annoying. When a game makes as much effort as possible to remove the player\u2019s ability to formulate opinions and make choices throughout the playthrough\\, the game is not engaging and intriguing to the player\\, it is annoying and dismissive. By force feeding us\\, you are treating us as if we are incapable of dissecting and interpreting the game ourselves\\, which is infuriating\\, and to that end it becomes easy to see that the game solely exists to sell us something (N**l **ckmann\u2019s agenda). The narrative is messy. The game is burdened by uninteresting new characters. Almost every character in the game feels like an inhuman caricature of what a person is supposed to be like. The main characters are so artificial that they can hardly be taken seriously\\, which discredits the story. The cutscenes are extremely overly gratuitous (both in violence and in sexuality)\\, to the point that it\u2019s offensive. Several sections of the game seem to severely overstay their welcome. The gameplay itself is more varied than that of its predecessor\\, but this one positive is marred by the fact that the game is simpler and easier than its predecessor\\, contributing to the fact that the game is flat out boring in some parts.    After playing The Last of Us Part II\\, it\u2019s clear to see that N**l **ckmann hated J**l\\, and hated the original game\\, as this game desperately tried to alienate itself from its predecessor\\, while trying ever so hard to create a new and different identity for itself. Unfortunately\\, The Last of Us Part II will only be remembered as a loud and ugly failure. I feel sorry for the those who fell in love with The Last of Us in 2013\\, who waited 7 years only to be so incredibly disappointed and aggressively disrespected. I feel sorry for the developers who had no say in the game\u2019s direction\\, who knew full well that the game they were working tirelessly on would be received poorly.    People hate this game for a reason\\, and paying for positive reviews from game critics\\, while simultaneously removing negative reviews from actual players will only make people\u2019s opinions on this game worse.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
