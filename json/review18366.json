Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was the best Star War film since Empire Strikes Back. I want to see it again. Luke Skywalker stole the show a superb performance. Some shocks in this\\, surprising ones for sure. I can\u0092t wait for the next one already.","true":true}
