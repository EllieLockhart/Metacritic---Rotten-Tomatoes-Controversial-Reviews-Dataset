Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not how this movie got such a high critic score\\,while I do not completely despise The last jedi it does leave a lot to be desired\\,it was rather anti climatic and instead of questions being answered you ended up with more questions and some of the answers were disappointing\\,the sad thing about the last Jedi is that it hasn't got any big moments that will be remembered in ten years time and I find funny that this movie has been compared to the empire strikes back yet there isn't any amazing plot twists in this\\,the story itself is nothing exciting and while there are some enjoyable moments in this the actual story itself could of been much better\\,I believe in ten years time this will not hold up well and I believe the prequels which I admit to enjoying had better plots than this and a richer variety of world building but in the last jedi you get hardly any of that plus not a proper lightsaber scene\\,I hope episode 9 will resolve some of the issue the last Jedi has and is more satisfying because if it doesn't I fear the cracks in the Star Wars franchise is already starting to show.","true":true}
