Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers*\\n\\n*(unless you have an amazingly low bar for definition of spoiler)\\n\\nStunning visuals\\,  Great acting...  But some lazy writing IMO.  \\n\\nTo many plot devices based on questionable logic and or technologies \/ abilities that are spontaniously created in the universe just to move the movie along with each getting some ham-handed literary exposition by the Empire's most in demand janitor that has apparently worked on every planet\\,  base and starship ever made by the first order...   \\n\\nI did enjoy the movie overall...  But found the \\\"Space Race\\\" and \\\"Floating Fairy Godmother\\\" parts a bit eye-rollish and felt that a good 30min section in \\\"Space Vegas\\\" was a bit long and could have been trimmed some while still developing the characters and moving the movie along.  \\n\\nThe most striking sequence being Equally both awe striking in its execution and baffling that nobody had ever tried this before?","true":true}
