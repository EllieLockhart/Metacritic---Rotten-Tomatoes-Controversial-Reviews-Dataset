Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all its toxic controversy\\, for all the depth of its heart and thoughtfulness of its characters\\, for all its nuanced individual character development and terse (albeit necessary) pruning of the wider mythos\\, the message of the movie is relatively simple: For a new day to ever dawn\\, let your heroes (and your self-righteous heroism) rest in peace. It is the lesson of Luke being no messiah\\, no god\\, but a mere mortal man\\, the same as he was back on Tatooine\\, who must learn to pass on the wisdom of his failures\\, not only the awesomeness of his power. It is the ethic that must be learned by Finn and Poe\\, whose misplaced moxie gets hundreds killed and sets the Resistance teetering on the brink of extinction. The idea that their intertwined\\, parallel plots lines are \\\"holes\\\" or \\\"worthless\\\" of course misses the entire point: No one can be a hero or a savior all the time (if anyone can be a savior or hero at all)\\, that their mistakes have consequences both positive (subjective growth) and negative (the loss of life)\\, that failure in the story is NOT a failure of the story\\, and most importantly\\, that there is no teleology to the universe\\, not even with the Force\\, which means that not everything must propel the action straightforward to its conclusion. It is ultimately a lesson as much for the characters as it is for the fans to learn.","true":true}
