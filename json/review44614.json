Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally disappointed!  The only star wars movie I hated.  Terrible story line\\, it's all over the place\\, it doesn't make sense!  I won't be going to watch it multiple times like I did with all the previous films.  And for the first time I'm not going to buy the DVD.  The fans have been let down by this horrible directing of this film.","true":true}
