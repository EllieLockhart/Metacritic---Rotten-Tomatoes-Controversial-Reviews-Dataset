Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the Yoda scene\\, respect the risk taking\\, and mostly enjoyed the movie. And yet\\, I left strangely sad and disappointed. I think if this was a Marvel movie it might've been fine\\, but the misplaced humor clashed with the nobility and solemnity of the theme song and movie themes. Unnecessary side stories and characters revealed a desire to comment on everything and in the noise of words I lost the central message. I think in the desire to speak on animal rights\\, social injustice\\, sexism\\, etc\\, all of these ended up being treated trivially rather than fully\\, because they were sort of forced in. I don't think it was too long because they loved it all\\, I think it was too long because they wanted to say too much.  Not to mention how much was said explicitly\\, and how little was shown. Then there's the plot holes.. That's probably what bothered me the most. Maybe I'm being silly\\, but its star wars so the stakes are naturally high. It means a lot to people so its hard to see things not be all they can be\\, especially with sufficient resources. You can read other people's posts to see my other reasons for disappointment\\, but these are my personal thoughts.. Star Wars fans are going to be less likely to like this\\, not because it's different\\, but because it's careless.","true":true}
