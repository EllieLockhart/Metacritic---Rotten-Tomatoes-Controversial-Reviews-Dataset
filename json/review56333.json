Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SW fan since '86\\, i even enjoyed the prequels which was a rarity among my generation. \\n\\nI can't believe SW has been so horribly mismanaged by Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm. TLJ was just a terrible clunky film all round and absolutely nothing was achieved by the end of it. \\n\\nI will not watch the new ROS film and refuse to accept the Disney Trilogy as canon. They're doing a lot better with The Mandalorian so i await with baited breath as to the future of a franchise that i cherished so dearly for 3 decades and now can barely stand to watch it anymore.","true":true}
