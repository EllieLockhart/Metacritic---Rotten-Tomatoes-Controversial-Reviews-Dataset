Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie... Contradictions galore\\, pointless skirmishes\\, character kill-offs were just anti-climactic... I'm not going to see the 9th movie\\, nor will I ever pay for other movies of this franchise\\, unless they are called Thrawn: A Star Wars story.","true":true}
