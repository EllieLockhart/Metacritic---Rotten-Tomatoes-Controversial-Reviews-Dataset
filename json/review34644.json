Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematic visuals are absolutely stunning. Other than that the movie was a pretty big let down. The quality of this trilogy is plummeting for each movie. star wars physics as well as regular physics are broken and in contradiction of previous movies in the series. the story is a lack of creative ideas and oddly similar to the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. idk why they felt the need to have a PETA commercial in the middle of a time sensitive moment in the movie. zero character development or I should say Zero to jedi master during a time sensitive moment\\, no real training or time required. too many Disney \\\"like\\\" actors. creating \\\"cool\\\" and \\\"Hardcore\\\" characters then being easily defeated by children type characters. too many impossibly miraculous strokes of luck... like 20 times in a row! come on... need I say more... time and urgency means nothing. Politically charged. SJW agenda. OLED product placement. It is clear that their main priority was to generate profits (such as paying someone to write an original story and so on). I will not go to see the next movies that they make.","true":true}
