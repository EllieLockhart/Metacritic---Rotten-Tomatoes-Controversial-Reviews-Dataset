Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed with this movie and the hype perpetuated by critics who have seen the early reviews. Without going into spoilers this movie is going in the direction to bring in the asian market and younger fans while sacrificing what made the original Star Wars great. All the new characters introduced in this movie are unnecessary and only serve to bring in a foreign market (talking about Rose). Laura Dern\\, Benicio DelToro and the asian girl who plays Rose are completely pointless and produce bad acting.","true":true}
