Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am no longer a fan of Star Wars. This movie was incoherent. Their were too many gaps in the storyline. The best way to describe what happened is a bunch of elite liberals got together and decided how best they can put there narrative\\, perhaps explore ideas they've had and integrate them within the film. Essentially this movie was about so many other things rather then Star Wars. I sat down and felt like so many messages were trying to be conveyed. \\n\\nThey completly destroyed the character of Luke to pave the way for other characters and Disneys ability to profit off future films rather the  put together a coherent film that was true to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
