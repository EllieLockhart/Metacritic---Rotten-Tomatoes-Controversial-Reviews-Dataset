Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Low rating has to be from Star Wars apologists from the 80s. The Last Jedi is tremendous. The only reason this isn't a 5-star is because it does run a little longer than it needed to. But Rose is fantastic. Finn is fantastic. Poe's transition is great. Luke isn't at all what I expected him to be\\, but\\, he reminded me of my childhood just the same same. Ren and Rey are such an immaculate pairing for this series. Those two are perfect. This show was fantastic.","true":true}
