Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a big star wars fan\\, to begin let me say I love new hope\\, empire and return of the jedi\\, the prequels other than revenge of the sith I am not as keen on. People are over reacting because Rian Johnson has tried to do something different\\, I'm glad he didn't just remake empire\\, Abraham's had to do force awakens similar to re-introdice nostalgia and gets fans excited again. \\n\\nI'm not going to write any spoilers\\, because don't want to ruin it for other audiences.\\n\\nI think people who are saying they hate it and it goes against star wars universe need to just take a step back\\, appreciate it for its story and creativity and the fact it pushes you to consider new powers and ideas.\\n\\nI loved the film and character development\\, throughout enjoyed it as dud number of my friends who grew up with prequels\\, just be glad it's not them.\\n\\nIt's a good story and people should let last die and appreciate it! Go watch it and make your own opinion\\n\\n5* from me though for creative thinking and different story that doesn't just repeat Empire strikes back.","true":true}
