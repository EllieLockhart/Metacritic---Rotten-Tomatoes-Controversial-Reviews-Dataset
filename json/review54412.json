Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left The Last Jedi feeling conflicted about it\\, which isn't a good sign.  I feel like the movie had a lot of decent ideas and a lot of very good pieces.  It was extremely well paced\\, beautifully shot\\, and well enough acted.  But somehow all came together to make something that was significantly worse than the sum of its parts.  \\n\\nIts hard to pin down exactly where things fall apart\\, but I suspect that it was an inability to take a red pen to several scenes and subplots.  I feel like the first scene best illustrates the issues I am talking about.  MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: the first order ambushes an evacuating resistance base\\, shows up with a superweapon\\, and it immediately gets crushed by the resistance\\, but then things happen which make this not quite the victory the resistance was hoping for.  Its a very good scene\\, fairly well acted\\, and all in all enjoyable.  You can cut the scene out entirely and it would have no impact whatsoever on the plot of the movie.  This is true for several other scenes in the movie\\, either not really contributing to the movie as a whole\\, or overlapping with other scenes which just make both scenes carry less value.  \\n\\nThe lack of bringing red ink to the script also shows through in several other ways.  The excessive use of both throwbacks and comic relief scenes (often overlapping) seriously hurts the script.  Later in the movie moments that are supposed to punch a slight hole in the tension to provide some contrast just don't because of overuse\\, which hurts those scenes.  \\n\\nCoupled with several plot-hole moments\\, strange dialogue and questionable decisions\\, all in all you are left with a product that has a lot of really good parts but nonetheless just doesn't work.","true":true}
