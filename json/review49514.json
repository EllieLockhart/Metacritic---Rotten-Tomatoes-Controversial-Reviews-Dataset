Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow. destroyed great characters. and too shy washy to commit to almost all of their good ideas.  y going back and forth and so many important plot points\\, i am now completely numb to the possibilities the future holds. since they basically did almost all of the plot twists\\, and then negated them pretty quickly.  i can't believe i have no interest in seeing episode nine in two years.  i never thought the day would come.","true":true}
