Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like the Star Wars prequels\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is an ill-conceived movie production lacking focus; a filter for its writing and directing; and competent editing. Being that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the follow-up to the re-energizing \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is an extremely disappointing feature film. Whenever there is a bright moment in \\\"The Last Jedi\\,\\\" the dialogue and directing choices always bring it back down to a sub-par level. \\\"Revenge of the Sith\\\" is a much stronger entry into the Star Wars universe\\, making \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" within the bottom three (3) as a live-action Star Wars entry. Furthermore\\, considering the dismantling of the beloved character that was Luke Skywalker\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the most damaging to the Star Wars legacy and canon.","true":true}
