Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a long time star wars fan And I can safely say that this is the worst star wars movie ever released.\\n-Horrible uninteresting new characters\\n-bad written \\n-so many lost opportunities to make an epic moment \\n-fin and rose are the worst characters in the whole star wars saga\\n-I really don't care about Rey or kylo now \\n-not hyped for episode 9","true":true}
