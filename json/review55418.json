Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many reviewers hate The Last Jedi because it is replacing the original trilogy. I can understand that: after all\\, the original trilogy is pure genius. However\\, if this new trilogy is going to survive\\, it is going to require growing beyond the original trilogy. The Last Jedi is that story of growing beyond. As the movie itself grows beyond the confines of the original trilogy\\, its characters grow beyond the confines of the original Big Three: Luke\\, Leia\\, and Han. Rey faces herself\\, and begins to learn not to define herself by her parents\\, or lack thereof. Finn defeats Phasma\\, effectively destroying the authority figure that had been haunting him. Kylo destroys Snoke\\, his master. Luke understands it is time not for the last Jedi\\, but for a new kind of Jedi. The type of Jedi like the orphan at the end\\, who looks up at the stars and imagines being like the legendary heroes he will grow up telling stories about. Star Wars will always be for the original fans\\, but now it's also for a new kind of fan.","true":true}
