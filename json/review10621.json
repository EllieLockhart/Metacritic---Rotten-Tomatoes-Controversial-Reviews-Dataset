Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"gutted\\, i waited ages to see luke skywalker again  back in action and what i got was a complete let down from the storyyy\\, SPOILER...no lightsaber fight with luke \\, i mean what the hell and now we will never see one again with luke.","true":true}
