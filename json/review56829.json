Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are no perfect movies\\, but I'm giving 10 to The Last Jedi\\, because even with its imperfections it is the best of the franchise by far and a great movie for fans and not yet fans. Rian Johnson showed us what he imagined of the Star Wars universe and it was the best usage of its different creatures\\, society and the Force\\, opening a vast range of new posibilities and stories.\\nKeep in mind that this is a movie\\, not a book. Its focus is on what is most important\\, so it won't answer all the questions\\, naturally. The movie give us everything we could ask for: amazing batles and fights (physical and emotional)\\, interesting characters\\, great villian\\, mounting tension and unexpected plot events. Plus it is a lot of fun to watch as well\\, but not trying hard to be funny.\\nWell done!","true":true}
