Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson turned Luke Skywalker into a selfish crusty old man. The Luke Skywalker in TLJ is not the true Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars universe. Rian clearly doesn't care about the fans\\, characters\\, and history of Star Wars. It doesn't seem like he even watched the previous films. Besides Luke\\, the story was terrible\\, it  had stupid jokes(JarJarBinks cringe worthy)\\, SJW cast\\, and major plot holes. Truth is\\, all Rian cared about was making money.","true":true}
