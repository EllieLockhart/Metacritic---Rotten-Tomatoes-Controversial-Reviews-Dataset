Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing movie! That really sucked! How in the world did the critics like that! The prequels get a ton of hate\\, but they are 10 times better than these last 2 piles of garbage.","true":true}
