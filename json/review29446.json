Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson had every opportunity to make an incredible star wars film\\, and failed spectacularly. JJ Abrams set him up so well with Force Awakens\\, but every decision Johnson chose to make in this film is the absolute worst decision you could make across literally all major characters. Disney has ruined Star Wars with its corporate feel and as a Star Wars fan since childhood who grew up watching the OT on VHS with my dad\\, disappointment is not strong enough a word to put how I truly feel. This marks the end of all good things for Star Wars\\, as much as I don't want that to be true.","true":true}
