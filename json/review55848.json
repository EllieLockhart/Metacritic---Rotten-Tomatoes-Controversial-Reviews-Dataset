Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pro: Incredible art and visual effects\\nCons: Weak\\, clunky story\\, poor chemistry between Rose and Finn\\, and enough plot holes to fly a Mandator IV Siege Dreadnought through.\\nOverall the movie gets a 'Meh' rating from me. It does not lend itself well to the Space Opera feel that Star Wars trilogies are famous for. Don't blame any of the actors and actresses in the least\\, they did the best they could with the garbage that Rian Johnson gave them. Btw\\, this opinion is held by my sister\\, a transwoman lesbian liberal\\, so no it wasn't catering to SJW. We also both agree that there is absolutely no way that Rey would not have fallen to the Dark Side\\, being raised as practically a slave\\, treated like garbage worse than Anakin was in the Phantom Menace\\, had 'friends' that betrayed her in that novel about three of the main characters. We both thought it would have been far more interesting an ending had she actually joined Kylo and a major twist no one at all would have expected.\\nWhat Rian Johnson should be credited for is creating the dumbest female character in the entire Star Wars franchise (both cannon and Legends). I speak of course of Admiral Holdo\\, for if she just told SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND STAFF of the ship she just switched her flag to (Poe Dameron most specifically) what the plan was\\, Poe wouldn't have gotten Finn and Rose off the ship to find a slicer (Legends term for hacker) that eventually betrays them for money\\, caused the death of dozens if not hundreds of members of the Resistance.","true":true}
