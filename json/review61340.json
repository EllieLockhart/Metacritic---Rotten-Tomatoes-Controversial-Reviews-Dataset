Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As much as I wanted to impulsively rate this very low\\, I will attempt to give an open minded review.\r\rPROS:\rGame looks phenomenal\rGame play is smooth\rAudio and music is on point\rMoments of real feeling and relating to the character\r\rCONS:\rStory line...... wtf & why\rCharacter model (abby) not consistent and unrealistic\rToo much push on LGBTQ\rPoor choice of over all message during sensitive pandemic\r\rSo let me explain my 6 rating.. It would have been much much higher... There were just certain aspects that made me almost quit... Aside from the obvious\\, in your face LGBTQ\\, which became almost comical\\, it was Abbys character model that was so ridiculous and unsightly. It was never consistent. He beefy muscles fluctuated in size from scene to scene. Maybe not so damning if you werent forces to play her so long.....\r\rThen there was the story... Dear lord.. the story.. The first ends on a note of love and going to extremes for those you love.... But this one.... hate\\, revenge\\, loss\\, grief.. It tore down Ellie and Joels character to the point I didnt even like Ellie at the end...\r\rFor me.... This was just a heinous act at such a sensitive time. We are all suffering a pandemic. We have been locked inside. Little to look forward to in 2020. For some... waiting YEARS for this game\\, saw a glimmer of hope in the release of this game..... I would not be surprised if this game threw some into a deeper depression. Reckless and there was no need to degrade our beloved characters to the point they did....\u2026 Expand","true":true}
