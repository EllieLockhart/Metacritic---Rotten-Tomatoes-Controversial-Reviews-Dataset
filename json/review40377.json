Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is sadly a poor ending for both Luke and Leia.. Cool as h*ll how powerful Luke is in the force but.. But the story feels full of holes and concentrated on things that isn't that important. I would have loved to more training footage the Island for starters..","true":true}
