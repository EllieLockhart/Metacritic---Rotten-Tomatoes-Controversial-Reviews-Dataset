Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK movie - not very good and not very bad - but a disappointment nonetheless.   The humor was ill placed.   The plot was largely borrowed from ESB and RoTJ - although gaping plot holes still remained.  The lack of any continuity of characters with the previous SW's was disturbing.  The pacing was poor or awkward. There was lots of action but little tensionLots of action - but little real tension. As a simple light entertainment\\, the movie was OK - but doesn't have a place in the Star Wars pantheon.\\n\\n\\nOK movie - not very good and not very bad - but a disappointment nonetheless.

Humor was ill-placed.   The plot was largely borrowed from ESB and RoTJ although gaping or nonsensical holes remained.  The lack of continuity of character from previous SW's was disturbing.   Rey invested little in her Hero's Journey - she apparently became a Jedi simply by sitting on a rock and doing calisthenics with a light-saber.  The pacing was poor or awkward - lots of action but little tension.   Overall an OK movie for light entertainment - but a poor entry in the Star Wars pantheon.","true":true}
