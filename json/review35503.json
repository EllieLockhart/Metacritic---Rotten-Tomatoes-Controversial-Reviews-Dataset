Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had some of the best moments in the saga and had some of the worse. I fundamentally disagreed with the treatment Rian gave Luke. JJ showed us Luke as a Jedi Master at the end of TFA but Rian turned him into a grumpy hermit which could be fine if we had some more backstory to why he got to the first jedi temple. He could just have gone to any other deserted planet to do what he wanted to do with his life. Snoke is a bust even though I liked the outcome of it but we needed to know more. The Leia scene is ridiculous. The whole canto bight\/space horses is irrelevant to the story and could be cut. The Marvel humour is not what Star Wars need. You had all the big 3 from the original trilogy for this one. It's a good movie that could have been so much better! I am disappointed with Rian. I liked Brick and Looper very much and was expecting a near flawless film. Now it is time for JJ to lift things up because TLJ left almost everyone with mixed feelings. Nobody clapped at the end of the movie and I already saw it twice.","true":true}
