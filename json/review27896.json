Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"pior filme da saga\\, n\u00e3o apenas teve uma historia p\u00edfia como conseguiu destruir a j\u00e1 fraca historia do ep7. s\u00f3 n\u00e3o dou nota 0 porque os efeitos especiais foram muito bons mas a historia \u00e9 prim\u00e1ria e digna de pena","true":false}
