{"101487":184195,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolute garbage. It shows that nobody in Disney\\, nor on same Lucasfilm has any idea of what Star Wars is. Not even Kathleen Kennedy\\, who is supposed to be the custodian of Star Wars lore and story cohesion and after working with Lucas for many years\\, you would think something of SW lore and sense would stick with her\\, well \\, it seems she's just a business woman who's only in for the money and doesn't care on the quality of the product....or she couldn't say no to Disney whims \\, which make her a coward business woman.\\nAnyway\\, is understandable that after the mess that The Force Awakens was \\, story wise\\, it would have been hard to fix that mess in the Last Jedi\\, or at least explain further some of the things portrayed in that movie\\, such as\\, who are the Knights of Ren?\\, Who the hell is Snoke\\, from where did he come from\\, how this apparently powerful being was out of the radar from the Sith of the galaxy (Palpatine and Vader)?. Why Rey is so powerful and knows how to master Jedi techniques where she had zero training before?. and a large etc etc etc.\\n\\nWell guess what\\, nothing of this is explained in TLJ and is actually discarded at all by Rian Johnson's horrible excuse of a script. He decided just to kill Snoke without providing background story\\, he decided that Rey is a nobody with nobody parents who sold her for booze. So she's just powerful\\, just because\\, you know\\, girl power and 21st century feminism. \\nKnight of Ren was a BS invented by JJ Abrams and Rian seems didn't like that subject so he decided to just ignore them completely in this movie.\\nAnd the worst sin of Johnson....he transformed Luke Skywalker into the ultimate coward in the galaxy. Yes\\, that same Luke Skywalker with many heroic traits from the original trilogy\\, that Jedi that sensed the good in his twisted and evil father (the second most evil villain in the galaxy\\, by the way) and went into a suicide mission to bring him back to the light \\, because he was family\\, that same Luke\\, years after in The Last Jedi eram he decided to kill his nephew (the only son of his twin sister and his freaking best friend\\, Han)\\, just because he showed few dark side tendencies....really Disney?.\\nThat made him a coward being and seems he didn't try anymore to bring Kylo back to the light or confront Snoke as the Master Jedi he supposedly was\\, he just left everybody\\, friends\\, family and decided he wanted to die alone in some forgotten island in a distant world. \\n\\nAnd for what reason Luke left a map so his friends could find him \\\"in a time for need\\\" in the first place\\, if the real reason for him was to escape to die alone and didn't want to be bothered?. It doesn't make sense at all.\\n\\nThe way Rian Johnson's disrespected Luke's character like that is unforgivable. It throws to the garbage can the Hero's journey that George Lucas built for this character. \\n\\nAlso\\, what was the point of Rose and Finn?\\, was just a distractor and made no purpose at all for the overall story. Why the admiral Hondo couldn't just tell Poe of her plans so he would't have call for mutiny in the first place? Is very idiotic of her part.\\n\\nAnd Leia Mary Poppins was ridiculous. Yes\\, she might have the force (she is the daugther of the Chosen one\\, Anakin Skywalker after all) and surely she also is strong in the Force\\, and might even have received training or some lessons from his brother Luke\\, but nothing of this is explained in the movie. Is just a Christmas miracle that she survived in the vaccum of space with no suit and  after an explosion blasted a few feet from her\\, it seems. Is Disney magic \\, most likely.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, this movie is deeply flawed and plain bad\\, Rian Johnson should just stick to direct and never touch a pen again to write ANYTHING.\\nI don't have any interest of the 3 pieces of garbage he will supposedly create in the new trilogy Disney assigned to him. He dropped the ball severely in the Last Jedi. \\n\\nMovie is not worth the money or your time. You will waste 2 and half hours of your life in this.","true":true}
