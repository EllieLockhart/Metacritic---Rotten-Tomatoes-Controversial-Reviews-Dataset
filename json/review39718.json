Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a good popcorn movie. However\\, a very disappointing Star wars movie. (lucasfilms needs to reign in their directors and writers and unify the lore.  The expanded universe makes far better canon than this directionless\\, non sensical\\, trashy story trilogy.._.)  I really wanted to be on board \\, now I am out :_(","true":true}
