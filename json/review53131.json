Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful!  Just awful...completely invalidated every storyline in episode VII.  No way in the SW universe that Luke would become what is represented in this film.  Not to mention how on earth has Leia honed her force abilities that she is now able to fly tru the vacuum of space ala \\\"Mary Poppins\\\"  Snoke\\, the almighty mystery is a nothing\\,  bad a$$ Phasma is a nothing\\, nothing left of rebellion (all that is left can comfortably fit on the millennium falcon!)  Rey is a nobody ( uh.... then why \\, as Maz asked in VII did the light saber call to her?) to have fans discuss ad nauseam\\, her mystery... only to make a joke of it?  How can you call this a Star Wars movie without a single light saber dual?  Canto Bite....literally bites.   Waste of screen time.   John and Daisy have such incredible onscreen chemistry!  They have totally different stories...not together at all\\, except near end ... and by the looks of it\\, their budding romance is over too!   Have been a fan since 1977\\, seen them all over and over again.\\, this will not be on my list to rewatch..... just hated the story.  There is a time and place to make the change  over to the next generation and all the planned spin offs .... this was not that time.  Hopefully this posts without too many typos.... can't go back and proof read.","true":true}
