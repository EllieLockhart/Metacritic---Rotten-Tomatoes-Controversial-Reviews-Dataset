Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything literally makes no sense in this movie\\, it's like just watching fireworks\\, beautiful graphics but shitty writing\\, Critiques participating here are out of their minds or they're just so dumb that they can easily be persuaded by beautiful graphics. 90% really?  they just threw their credibility out the window.","true":true}
