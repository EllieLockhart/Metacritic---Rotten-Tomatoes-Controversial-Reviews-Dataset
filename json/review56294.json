Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars TLJ exemplifies the effect that corporate influence can have on a film. Gone are the days of coherent stories & writing\\, logical rules being upheld and interesting characters with long-term setups. All of that is traded away for Disney to moralfag about how diverse their cast is in terms of genitalia and country\/ethnicity of origin. Although it can be assumed that they also care about a diversity in acting talent\\, as can be seen by the shitstain that was the performance given by Kelly Tran\\, although we can share the blame around to the writing department. Between the Canto Bight social justice animal welfare plotline that delivers nothing even with the hacker\\, to Luke's death\/transcendence into the force providing no utility to the story\\, Rey's continued overpowered state with no training or explanation to the lovely awkward pauses left in the movie for those \\\"aww shucks PORGS xD\\\" disney humour moments\\, it's amazing they even had time left for a half-decent duel between the leads (one of which has no training) of the movie. Oh\\, and it can't be forgotten that Yoda's CGI looks like an upgraded asset from the clone wars tv show\\, or the pressing problem that Snoke's death delivers; there is no tension in the movie. Seriously\\, does Kylo actually pose any threat at all to Rey? FFS at this point you'd need the audience to be on the side of the First Order to feel any form of dramatic tension in the movie. But hey\\, atleast the movie had an Asian lead character\\, and that's what really matters\\, or so the mainstream media say. Thank you Disney\\, for proving right what I proclaimed so melodramatically in 2012 when the purchase of Lucasfilm was made. Atleast at the end of the day\\, I get to be right\\, by having StarWars become so wrong.","true":true}
