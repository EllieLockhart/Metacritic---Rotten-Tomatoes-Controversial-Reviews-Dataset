Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just a bad movie with pretty shallow characters and nonsensical plot that wastes at least 30-45 minutes on a subplot that goes nowhere. It also disrespects the old trilogy by doing a 180 with Luke's character. Rian Johnson probably didn't like (mediocre) TFA\\, because he crushes every set-up JJA put in the previous movie.\\n\\nNew characters are total misfires\\, and Laura Dern's character is so out of the place that it physically hurts to see her miscast so badly. I have no desire to watch another SW movie again\\, and it's kind of laughable to see all the think-pieces telling me that I'm a Russian bot or some kind of neo-nazi for wanting a good movie every now and then.\\n\\nI have little against Disney putting more female characters in their Star Wars. But do some good\\, relatable and badass female characters like in Mad Max: Fury Road (Furiosa\\, Capable)\\, not this. It's laughable that defenders of this movie are willing to accept such a stain on the franchise and so annoying\\, stupid and selfish characters just because they're female\\, as if it was an excuse for writers\\, producers and storytellers to underdeliver.\\n\\nWith Carrie Fisher dead and all the SW \\\"deconstructed\\\" (euphemism for \\\"ruined\\\"\\, but hey\\, that's what I read in the rave reviews) Disney has a tough way ahead of them\\, but I won't be there to watch it. I hope they enjoy their too-big-to-fail franchise kill off the sorry remains of the special atmosphere Star Wars once had. I am sorry for Adam Driver\\, because I like him and his character is enjoyable in this movie\\, and I'm sorry for Mark Hamill that he signed the contract that made him kill his legacy.","true":true}
