Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Worst Game of the generation.Period. Naughty Dog was one of those studios who created the best story driven game from The Last Of Us to Uncharted games. Now we have this Game. I don't care about agenda\\,politics\\,left \\,right\\,diversity. I just want to play a good decent story driven game. The Last Of Us is Joel and Ellie\\,Without them There is no last of us. This game is just pure torture.BUT Voice Acting and graphics in this game is excellent and the music is absolute genius.Overall i would have given this 6\/10 but it really made me depressed when i was playing the game. The naughty dog should not have made Abby as a playable character.She is not like-able at all .I just feel very sad for Ellie\\,she lost everything.It kinda funny that in the end there is a soundtrack which is beyond desolation. It sums up Ellie's life. YUP\\,its sad.TRUTH BE TOLD EVERYTHING IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR  THE STORY. IT'S  pure garbage\\,Trash\\,Poop.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
