Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was excellent. Many people may be upset by the changes it made to the canon or the long runtime\\, but I for one thought these changes are what truly make this film epic.","true":true}
