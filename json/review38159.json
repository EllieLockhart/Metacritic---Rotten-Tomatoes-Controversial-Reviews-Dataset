Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The theme to this movie is Plot-holes\\, Disney's shallow attempt to \\\"girl-power\\\" the Star Wars universe and unnecessary goofy humor (hey - it works for Marvel so we'll throw it in here).  I guess if that's the way the route that Disney wants to take with Star Wars go right ahead - but I won't be running out to see the next movies like I previously had.  Hubby and I saw TFA 4 times in the theater \/ won't even humor the idea of seeing TLJ again.  I agree with other reviewers - the critics must be getting paid by Disney or they are just afraid to be blackballed by them since Disney now owns Fox studios - they are all sheep.","true":true}
