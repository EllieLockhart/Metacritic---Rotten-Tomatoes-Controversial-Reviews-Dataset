Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was everything I feared. It was just okay as a movie in it's own right\\, but it ruined a childhood hero. Rian Johnson accomplished something that neither Darth Vader nor Emperor Palpatine could. He killed Luke. Not only did he kill Luke\\, but he utterly disgraced him and turned him into a nearly detestable character. Yoda laughs at Luke after he is fooled by Rey who has stolen his books. He needlessly dies a defeated coward and a fool\\, responsible for the greatest tragedy depicted in the Star Wars film universe: The destruction of several planets and the end of the Republic he once fought to save. For the record\\, This will be my Last Star Wars Movie. I hope I can reconstruct the Star Wars universe I believed in for myself\\, after Johnson has done the best he could to destroy it.","true":true}
