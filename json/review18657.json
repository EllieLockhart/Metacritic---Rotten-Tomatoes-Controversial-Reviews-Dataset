Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It pretty much did everything I wanted it to. The only problem for me was that it's the second part in a trilogy and we have not gotten all the answers yet. But if 9 keeps this momentum up and end with a bang I don't see how anyone honestly can hate on this new trilogy.\\n\\nTremendous.","true":true}
