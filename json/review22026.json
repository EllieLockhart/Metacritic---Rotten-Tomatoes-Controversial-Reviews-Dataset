Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watched it last night. I think this movie is actually right up there with the originals. It did have that Empire deal to it but you get so much more. More about the force more about the resistance and first order and more about Luke and what really happened before the Force Awakens. Its really a great movie and i think it will be a great addition to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
