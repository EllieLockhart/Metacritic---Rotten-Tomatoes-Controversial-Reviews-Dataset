{"101487":168682,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some WTF questions you may have after seeing Star Wars The Last Jedi.....in no particular order\\n\\nWhy did anyone think the image of Statue of Liberty\/Mary Poppins \/Superman Leia-in-space was a good thing? Gee\\, I can hardly wait for all those hilariously cruel gifs and memes to start circulating\\, acting as a great visual reminder of this beloved character.\\n\\nWhat was the point of Canto Bight?\\n\\nWhy did anyone think it funny that Finn (played by the wonderful John Boyega) knew the intimate details of the layout of the Supremacy from mopping it's floors? Seriously? Tone deaf much??\\n\\nWhy did we spend time on a shitty\\, melodramatic back story for Rose Whatserface\\, yet nothing on characters we're already invested in?\\n\\nWhy did Leia slap Poe? Can't a woman\\, even one of the calibre of Princess\/General Leia Organa command enough respect and authority from her officers without dissolving into a hissy fit? Why didn't they have her stamp her feet and pull at her hair and destroy the woman's dignity altogether? Oh\\, yeah they already did that didn't they?- see point 1.\\n\\nWhy was this movie made as an entry into the MCU? Star Wars not a big enough franchise??\\n\\nHow does Benicio Del Toro know of Sir Bruce Forsythe (RIP) and why did he think that doing an impression of Brucie doing an impression of Hannibal Lechter was a good dramatic choice?\\n\\nWhy could the mega-omnipotent- \\\"more powerful than the Emperor and Vader\\\"- Snoke\\, not sense or hear the light-sabre beside him.\\n\\nWhy did the \\\"fight\\\" in the throne room appear to have been choreographed by someone from a West End musical?\\n\\nWhy did this feel very like a Harry Potter movie whenever anyone used magic - I mean the force? Leia was definitely channelling Professor McGonagall when she \\\"Bombardier-ed\\\" the doors. And I fully expected Rey to issue forth a hearty \\\"expelliarmus!\\\" at any moment.\\n\\nWho told Daisy Ridley she can act?\\n\\nWhy did they waste a potentially great character in Snoke?\\n\\nWhy did they waste a phenomenal actor like Andy Serkis by wasting a potentially great character like Snoke?\\n\\nWhy did the nice purple-haired middle-aged lady have to be shoe-horned into the movie to carry out the noble sacrifice? Hey\\, Admiral Ackbar\\, fan favourite\\, beloved character could have done that\\, thus sending we fangirls and boys into paroxysms of nerdgasmic delight. Might have earned a few brownie points there Rian - if you only had a clue about Star Wars.\\n\\nWhy didn't the First Order just discharge some TIEs or shoot their big laser thingies at the Resistance cruiser instead of faffing about waiting for it to run out of space-petrol?\\n\\nWhy are rich people portrayed as evil? I mean the Organa's were rich\\, and they were pretty good weren't they? oh\\, hang on\\, they may have a point here. Rian J's got to be worth a bob or two. And KK\\, and all the Disney Lucasfilm dudes are defo rolling in it\\, and they're all pretty despicable aren't they? So maybe I'll concede that point.\\n\\nWhy would Yoda\\, upon meeting Luke for the first time in Lord knows how long\\, revert to the silly act he first used to test Luke on Dagobah?\\n\\nAnd WHY\\, in the name of all things Star Wars\\, would Luke FUCKING Skywalker\\, consider\\, even for half a second\\, murdering his nephew? Destroy Jedi Lore? Casually toss away the family light-sabre? Run away to an island to die?\\nLuke Skywalker\\, the man who never gave up on his monster of a father who brutalised him and pursued him across the galaxy. Luke Skywalker\\, who looked evil in the eye after being tormented and tortured half to death and declared \\\"I am a Jedi\\, like my father before me\\\". Luke Skywalker\\, who fought alongside and lost many friends and comrades and NEVER gave up.\\n\\nWhy the effing hell was Rian Johnson allowed to do this?\\n\\nAnd the last question ..are you listening Disney Lucasfilm? Do you give a flying fart? Or are you really just laughing all the way to the bank because you know silly cows like me already booked 3 tickets way in advance to see this diabolical shit-fest. Well that money is in your grubby little hands now\\, but did you really think we would just suck it up without complaint? No way. We love Star Wars because it's partly about standing up for what is right and speaking out against what is wrong - and you are so very wrong!","true":true}
