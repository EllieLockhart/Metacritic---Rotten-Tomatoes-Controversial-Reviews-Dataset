Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. As a Star Wars fan I wanted to love it\\, and there were some pretty great parts\\, but there were also terrible and infuriating parts and the humour was off tone. Searching my feelings while leaving the theatre\\, the sum was not a Star Wars movie I was hoping for or expecting and I was ultimately disappointed with what I had watched. How on earth did this director lock down a further trilogy based on this just baffles.","true":true}
