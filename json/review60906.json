Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is incredibly disappointing. I had a feeling it wouldn't be as good as the first game\\, but this was just a garbage story. There were so many flashbacks and it just felt like the game was out of order. I also hated playing as Abby and almost wanted to stop playing the game entirely. Not to mention\\, the boss fight against Ellie as Abby disturbed me a lot and probably many others because I love Ellie and I have no sympathy for Abby... sorry. On the other hand\\, the graphics were amazing and the combat was okay\\, I liked the new additions (new infected\\, jump button\\, army crawl\\, etc.) I think they did a very good job of polishing the gameplay. Overall\\, I think I should have just watched play-throughs of this game on Youtube instead of actually buying it myself.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
