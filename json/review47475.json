{"101487":195731,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I learned from Star Wars: The Last Jedi... aka Star Wars: The Liberal Jedi (Spoilers are included\\, so stop reading here if you have yet to see it.)\\n\\n1. We must save & free all animals that are being caged. All that segment needed was Sarah McLachlan singing \\\"In the arms of the angel\\\" as the space animals gave sad faces throughout.\\n2. All men are idiots and women know everything & make all the right moves:\\n-Poe is the anti Hon Solo as his gut is wrong every time\\n-Finn is supposed to be a weathered soldier\\, but he comes off scared & chaotic while a lowly female mechanic is calm\\, cool & collected.\\n-Kylo Ren is an emotional\\, psychotic wreck\\n-Luke Skywalker who once was fearless against Darth Vader\\, the Emperor & the entire Empire is now mistake ridden & terrified of pretty much everything.\\n3. Rich people are the root of all things evil and we should do everything in our power to take them down... aka socialism.\\n4. Old things like Jedi books (aka religion) are frivolous & while they may have a good story or two\\, we really don't need their guidance. Nor do we need any training or mentoring because we were born with everything that we need! (aka we're our own Gods) This a clear shot at religion being \\\"old\\\" and something that we don't need.\\n5. Other stupid things about The Last Jedi:\\n-Apparently there's now gravity in space in the future.\\n-A fleet of Star Destroyers could have easily surrounded & shot down the small rebel fleet\\, but they chose to putz along at a snails pace.\\n-An all knowing Emperor Snoke who is 10 steps ahead of everyone didn't know that Kylo Ren was betraying him or see\/hear the light saber moving? \\n-Princess Leia is now Superman in space?\\n-Princess Leia doesn't die in the film even though Carrie Fisher died in real life... all the while Mark Hamil is still very much alive\\, but Luke dies in a very unfulfilling way for his character. \\n\\nI had high hopes for this movie after The Force Awakens\\, but Rian Johnson absolutely left the series in shambles. Like literally worse than the prequel type of shambles. I have no clue where they go from here because everything is so screwed up. All the heroes of the originals have been wrongly run out of the series without any limelight or justice for their characters. How Rian Johnson thought any of this was a good idea is beyond me. #VeryDisappointed","true":true}
