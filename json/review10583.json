Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals\\, but extremely poor story\\, disgusting insertion of politics\\, slap-in-face rejection of plot setups from previous episode\\, disrespect to Luke\\, overload of merchandising\\, weak energy (the pure energy between Rey and Fin was lost and not recreated)\\, ignoring the laws of physics\\, the movie was self-aware. Honestly\\, episode 9 should explain that episode 8 was a nightmare that Fin had while unconscious.","true":true}
