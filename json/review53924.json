Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cL5oCP0VIEI\\nhttps:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/the-walt-disney-company-have-disney-strike-star-wars-episode-viii-from-the-official-canon\\n\\nI agree with most of the negative reviews.  I left the theater thinking I did not watch a Star Wars movie.  Having read books and watch the animated series\\, there is so much missing!  Dinsey has messed up with the Star Wars franchise.  The episodic directors for Clone Wars and Rebels should have directed the movies.  They understand the Star Wars universe\\, the Skywalker bloodline\\, and the idea of the light\/dark side of the force(the SITH vs JEDI).  I left the movie with no expectation or anticipation for episode IX.  Where was a bad ass lightsaber battle?  The Knight of Ren?  What happened to LUKE's character!?  Captin Phasma was a wasted character?  SO MANY PLOT HOLES!!! THIS WAS RIDICULOUS!!!  Thanks Disney for destroying the Star Wars universe\\, \\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you are meant to be.\\\"","true":true}
