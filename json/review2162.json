Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A tepid mess of a movie\\, with a script so shoddy and dull that even Rian Johnson's eye and skill with the camera couldn't save it. The heavy-handed presence of the Disney executive committee is blatant\\, the character development is thin\\, and almost every plot thread or question raised from the The Force Awakens is simply cut. \\n\\nWho are they selling this to? The cultural presence of Star Wars has diminished tenfold since Disney turned the franchise into a factory\\, and after the mediocre 2015 edition\\, the casual viewer won't have any interest in this. The fanboys who will flock in droves to buy tickets to anything \\\"Star Wars\\\"? Not them\\, surely\\, seeing as how fan favourite characters are undermined and then crudely pushed out of the picture left and right. Did we really need to see a geriatric Carrie Fisher fly through space like Superman? Or a cackling Yoda\\, burning the sacred tree of Jedi knowledge in the fashion of Fahrenheit 451? Whatever the plan is moving forward (if there is one)\\, Disney better get together and try and come up with a carefree yet colorful sci-fi romp as first envisioned by Lucas\\, and not this regurgitated\\, focus-group tested mess.","true":true}
