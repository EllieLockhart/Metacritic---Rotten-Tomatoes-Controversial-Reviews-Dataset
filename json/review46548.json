Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched TLJ last night and I was blown away. Before talking about the content\\, the actual execution of the film was fantastic. The script\\, cinematography\\, acting and score were superb. The only exception was Daisy Ridley's performance which I thought was lacking emotion at certain points\\, especially in the first two thirds of the film but she was still good. \\n\\nAs for the content there were a lot of surprises (obviously) but not one of them that I was disappointed with. I thought the evolution and characterisation was natural and unforced and it made sense. \\n\\nOne of the only real criticisms I can make of the film is some of the humour (IMO) came at the wrong time. There were some tense\/emotional moments that were waylaid by humour which I thought disrupted the tone in parts.\\n\\nAs a film on its own it gets 8.5 out of 10 for me. However after 9 is released and all the mystery is revealed I expect that score to increase. I think this trilogy is gointo be so intrinsically linked it will be hard to judge each film individually until the series is completed.","true":true}
