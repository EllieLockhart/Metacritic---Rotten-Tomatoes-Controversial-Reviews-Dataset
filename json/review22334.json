Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi so far is the worst Star Wars movie ever . Who will return my money that I ve spent on the ticket to the cinema ? the pursue theme is just awful . There is little logic after protagonists choice . Movie was shot for kids only .","true":true}
