Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'The force awakens' gave me a little prejudice before seeing this movie\\, as to how simplified I felt \u00abgood vs evil\u00bb was portrayed in a clich\u00e8 way. Watching 'The last Jedi' completely turned my impression around and left me in awe. It was a stunning movie\\, with amazing characters and character development. The spiritual turmoil of The Force in this particular movie\\, and complication of what is 'good' and 'bad' was used to truly open one's mind. I was also quite happy to see Yoda back in the movie\\, with his mischievous character\\, yet sharing true wisdome to the troubled Jedi\\, Luke.","true":true}
