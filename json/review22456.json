Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Legendary Luke Skywalker - Humanized. A man so powerful with the force\\, now with flaws & mistakes -- The film has split its \\\"fan-base\\\" due to this. For me\\, TLJ is one of the best Star Wars film to date -- there are its flaws & unanswered questions from the previous film; but the overall plot completely spat on my expectations\\, in a good way.","true":true}
