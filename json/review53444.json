Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney owns ABC\\, ESPN\\, and many media outlets.  Do critics fear to put a damper on Disney's $200 million flop?  How else can you explain such high critic scores for a shallow\\, and soulless sci-fi reboot?  This movie had the special effects\\, the production values\\, all the money in the world\\, but it had no soul.  This movie is the Evil Empire of Star Wars movies\\, and has the lowest return rate of audiences in the franchise.  Wait and rent it on DVD\\, not worth top dollar in a theater.","true":true}
