Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They have taken our beloved Star Wars and basically ruined it. Horrendous continuity gaps. story-line twists throughout that were written for the sake of story-line twists. There is too much to cover in one review\\, but I can state that I hated it and found it upsetting that Star Wars has been taken in this farcical direction. If I could get my ticket money back\\, I wouldn't hesitate.","true":true}
