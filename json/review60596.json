They use sound expertly to build and release tension as well as create some real moments of horror. The set pieces are spectacular and awe-inspiring. This is what we\u2019ve come to expect from perfectionists Naughty Dog.In terms of story\\, this game sets out to tell a very different one from the first. It\u2019s gritty and often leaves the player feeling a sense of hopelessness. The story does have moments of light and dark but offers nowhere near as much light as the first entry in the series. Some may like this approach\\, whilst others might hate it. I personally loved the approach that they took with the game; the key element to the story pivoting around the idea of differing perspectives. Naughty Dog could\u2019ve played it safe and made a predictable story that doesn\u2019t bring any new ideas to the table.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
