Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had some great moments\\, sure. But the ball was dropped on some very significant plotlines. All the questions created in TFA were simply ignored or left to die in this movie. JJ's going to struggle to pick up the pieces in episode 9. \\n\\nAlso\\, the humor is being taken too far. This is Star Wars\\, not the MCU.","true":true}
