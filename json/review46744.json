Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well after a week\\, finally put together most of what I think about The Last Jedi and Disney's Star Wars as a whole atm. This is going to be long.\\n\\nI think part of the disconnect between Star Wars EU fans and many of the defenders of the Disney Reboot is a fundamental disagreement on the nature of Star Wars.\\n\\nFor me\\, and many other fans\\, the films are only a small part of the entire Star Wars saga. When I was a kid I watched the 3 films so many times. . . but when I found the novels\\, games\\, and comics that were based on it\\, and realized that they told one large interlocking story and were all part of the same saga\\, it was clear to me that Star Wars wasn't just about movies.\\n\\nBefore the Disney reboot\\, if you were a Star Wars fan and you wanted to focus on the prequels\\, or on the Old Republic era\\, or on the Legacy era (or other eras). . .you could\\, and there would be plenty of material to read and play and watch in a variety of eras. Star Wars had a wide variety of stories being told across many eras\\, many styles of storytelling\\, and while they all branched off from the 6 movies\\, the movies were like the roots of a tree. . .so much more grew past them and spread out beyond them.\\n\\n. . .to Disney however\\, Star Wars is ultimately just a movie series. A new movie every year\\, complete with hype and marketing machine to make sure all the fans are interested in this years movie. All the novels and comics and games\\, while ostensibly canon\\, are only there to tie-in to the movies. We haven't see any major plot points in the reboot novels\\, comic and game so far\\, they are all forgettable side stories\\, everything big is saved for the movies (Oh wait wasn't true for TLJ..).\\n\\nIt's two completely different\\, fundamentally incompatible ways of looking at Star Wars. One is the way of the longtime devoted more \\\"hardcore\\\" fan\\, one who stayed with Star Wars long before the prequels came out and after they left films\\, when books and comics and games was all the new Star Wars material. . .the other is the path of the more \\\"casual\\\" fan who forgets about Star Wars unless there's a new movie-related marketing campaign to remind them.\\n\\nI think ultimately Disney\\, Abrams and Johnson are trying to build their new Star Wars franchise by tearing down the Original Trilogy. All the main characters have either devolved in terms of characterization or are failures. Han\\, abandoning Leia and the Republic\/Reistance\\, and going back to being a smuggler. Luke walking back on his compassion to redeem his father to contemplating murder of his nephew. And of course the Jedi Order is still gone and the New Republic is a failure so they can go back to Rebel vs Empire (except now called the Resistance and the First Order).\\n\\nWhen Disney took over Star Wars and wiped the old EU\\, the main argument for this was that Disney would be able to create a better\\, internally coherent\\, tonally consistent\\, more well thought out universe through central planning and direction like they had done with the MCU in which directors would be able to bring their own unique style and vision to serve one bigger story.\\n\\nThis movie has made quite clear that this is simply not the case with Disney's new Star Wars. It is very clear that Abrams and Johnson had very different visions and ideas when it comes to Star Wars and this hurt this movie imho. In many ways this movie felt more like Johnson establishing his vision of what the SW universe should be like rather than telling the best possible story. The subplot of Rose\\, Canto Bight and war profiteering for example felt like something he wanted to bring into the universe\\, but that was almost completely irrelevant to the overall plot of the film. It also seemed like there were several characters and plot elements that had been set up in TFA that he had to accommodate without having much interest in them or knowing what to do with them. Overall it resulted in a movie in which the plot barely progressed\\, despite a very lengthy run time\\, in which questions could not be satisfyingly answered and that felt quite jarring compared to the previous movie. If Johnson would have been able to make this movie without needing to explain\\, accommodate or undo parts of TFA that he had no interest in or if alternatively he could have bought his unique style to an already well though out\\, planned and more closely controlled project\\, I think this would have been a truly great movie\\, as it is now\\, I just can't like this movie.\\n\\nNot a fan of this new canon. Long as Disney is them doing might as been the last Star Wars movie I'll see. After that movie have zero interest in any furtrue ones.\\n\\nThere are very serious issues\\, both in-universe and out-universe\\, of mischaracterization\\, poor subplots\\, drop plots and plot holes\\, a lack of understanding of the mythology\\, power creep and how the Force manifests itself. And not just because they threw the old EU out the window. Their not even following their own canon between the the two movies. Let alone all the set up from the new books\/comics. It's a 3 out of 10 for me\\, and only because of Hamill's performance given bad material.\\n\\nAnd seeing as there already 20+ novels\\, 19+ comic series\\, 3 movies\\, and 2 games (why the hell did they gave EA rights to the games is beyond me.) for this new Canon. 80% which I see\/read. Say what you want\\, but can't say I didn't give it a try. Think that more than enough to judge if it something I'll like it or not. And guess what like old EU more\\, and grow up with it.\\n\\nFor those that like the new canon\\, glad for you. You all have years of new stuff to look forward to. As for me I'll go back\\, reread\\, watch and play the old stuff. Still love Star Wars\\, but not this new canon.\\n\\nMajor issues I have with the film.\\n\\nOn the Leia part.\\n\\nIn the new canon she had no interest in learning about the force or being a Jedi. Was said in their new canon book Bloodlines\\, which is like 5 to 7 years before TFA. Just before thing go down with Ben and Luke going off to die.\\n\\nAnd In Heir to the Jedi\\, which follow Luke right after the first Death Star. He having a hard time learning how the use the force without a teacher. Yet Rey and now Leia do all that stuff with no training what so ever...\\n\\nThe 2nd and one that I have not really seen many people commenting on yet\\, is that it completely undermines the original Star Wars saga. Star Wars at its core is a story of redemption\\, of a hero who falls and is turned into a literal and figurative monster deprived of his humanity both bodily and morally who is rescued by the love and trust of the only person who sees the good left in him even if he himself and no-one else does. The catalyst of this redemption is Luke the only person with absolute faith in the redeemability of his father.\\n\\nAnd now this movie completely undercuts this core character trait of Luke by having him try to preemptively murder Ben\\, because he thinks that he may turn evil. The person who was willing to give up his own life\\, because he believed in redeeming somebody who had committed absolutely heinous crimes\\, now suddenly believes that Ben who has not even done anything evil yet is absolutely irredeemable and that the only way of stopping him is killing him.\\n\\nNow don't get me wrong\\, subverting such a core theme of a series is not inherently bad and could have had the potential to be one of the most impactful and thought-provoking aspects of the new trilogy. But for such a subversion to work it has to be handled with much care and thought and is not something that can be thrown into the movie without any explanation. The movie gives no explanation as to why Luke\\, a total believer in redemption\\, suddenly believes that Ben is so irredeemable that he has to be killed before he has even turned evil. And yes Luke says something about how he was not thinking straight in that moment and regretted it almost immediately afterwards\\, but that still does not explain why the thought crossed his head in the first place (unless it is explained away as Snoke manipulating him through the force\\, which would be an extremely cheap cop-out that denies the character of all agency) or why he was so convinced of Kylo's irredeemability throughout the rest of the movie.\\n\\nNow Luke's betrayal was obviously an essential moment for Kylo's entire character arc and this just underlines the problem that I have with his character: the fact that it makes no sense for him to be evil in the first place. Basically\\, Abrams put in the cool and shocking twist that Han and Leia's son was evil without putting any significant amount of thought into why he was evil and leaving others to come up with an explanation. With this the new trilogy had essentially written itself into a corner and the only explanation for Ben turning evil that made any sense was one that involved Luke acting in a manner that completely defied every aspect of his personality without any explanation and almost ruined his character.\\n\\nAnd the 3rd:\\n\\nNothing about who and what Snoke is\\, after giving hints in the new books (Aftermath\\, Bloodlines\\, and Thrawn) about the start of the First Order and where he came from. Why aren't they following up on what said in the books isn't that point of their new canon..\\n\\nSnoke is literally the entire reason this story is even happening; he made the First Order (somehow)\\, he corrupted Ben Solo (somehow...did they even meet first?). This is a big fucking deal. The first movie could get away with introducing him as a mystery to be explored later. \\\"Nah\\, he's dead now so we ain't gotta explain shit\\\" is not an acceptable payoff to this plot hook.\\n\\nThe previous films in the series established that powerful force-users aren't a dime a dozen and only a few decades ago Sith were thought to be extinct. By the time of the original trilogy the existence of the Sith is known... but there is a grand total of two of them in the galaxy.\\n\\nSo introducing a new\\, powerful\\, dark-force user (despite their rarity) out of nowhere in the sequels and then telling the audience \\\"who cares where he came from? That's not important\\\" seems like incredibly bad storytelling. It would be like\\, say\\, Tolkien deciding to write a sequel to The Lord of the Rings where we find out there is another Ring of Power out there and when people ask \\\"Huh? I thought the previous books made it clear that there was only 19 rings and that destroying the One Ring rendered the rest useless!\\\" Tolkien just replies \\\"Who cares? That's not important\\\".\\n\\nIf Snoke was meant to be a one-off character that was to be killed off early & be replaced by Kylo then he shouldn't have been an uber-powerful dark-force user. He should have been a former Imperial admiral or something that created the First Order (heck\\, they could have made him blue-skinned and red-eyed and we would have went nuts if it was implied that the First Order is controlled by a film-version of Thrawn). That way he would serve the same purpose without leaving a bunch of plot-holes and unanswered questions.\\n\\nThey're tearing down the universe piece by piece. At any time in the movie\\, did it ever feel like an epic conflict involving thousands of worlds? We had 4 Star Destroyers chasing 1 midsize ship and 3 small ones\\, for at least 1 or 2 days\\, while lightspeed now seems like instantaneous travel. Canto Bight is on the other side of the galaxy from the chase area...\\n\\nAnd don't get me started on how they fucked up the basic lore of Star Wars! Remember how Yoda said the Dark Side was easier\\, more seductive? Now we have Kylo Ren whose main conflict is \\\"I want to be bad\\, but my feel\\\". That is not how it's supposed to work.\\n\\nAnd Rey being angry and hateful at Kylo Ren and Snoke\\, yet Yoda praises her to be a Jedi already who doesn't need to study the books\\, she already possesses their wisdom. And when Rey looks at Snoke with loathing and hatred\\, he says \\\"Now that's a Jedi reaction!\\\" with no hint he is being sarcastic... are you kidding me? They're saying the Jedi are supposed to be about \\\"hope\\\"\\, that's not true at all. Jedis are supposed to evacuate emotions and attachment and dedicate themselves to balancing the world from those whose greed and ambitions would destroy it. If they are a symbol of hope\\, that is not central to their philosophy\\, it has never been.\\n\\nThe old EU was better than this. Especially since it's a much more interesting seeing how the galaxy further evolve over the centuries. 30 go by in the new canon with not know anything and we just back to Empire vs Rebel...\\n\\nThese new films have almost made me love the prequels. Although a bunch of lame shit was thrown in with some not-so-great acting at least they told a good story. Motivations are so muddied and the story is so inconsistent that I found myself not even caring about anyone in this film. 2 and a half hours of my evening for a really cool 5 minute fight scene?","true":true}
