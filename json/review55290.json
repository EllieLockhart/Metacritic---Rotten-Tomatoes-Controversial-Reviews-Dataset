Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me begin by saying that I've been a fan of star wars since I was a little child. Thanks to my dad\\, I grew up watching the Original Trilogy on VHS. I was thrilled for the opportunity to go see them in the theater with him when the Special Editions were released. I even enjoyed many parts of the sequels. I loved the Cartoon Network Animated Clone Wars Series! They were amazing! I even watched the CG Clone Wars and Rebels TV series\\, because I was curious about the lore. When I first saw her\\, I didn't like Ahsoka\\, be the TV shows did an amazing job of growing her character to who we saw in Rebels\\, and she's one of my favorites now. I enjoyed The Force Awakens. It was like a warm fluffy blanket just out of the dryer\\, and I really looked forward to all the plot threads that had been laid out.\\nThen we got The Last Jedi. It has issues far too numerous to go over here. I wanted to like it\\, I really did; but the more I thought about it\\, the more I talked my my friends about it\\, the more tings that stood out in the movie as being weird\\, out of place\\, and just plain wrong. But the critic reviews were so high\\, I thought maybe I was being overly critical. But as time went on\\, more and more people have noticed and commented\\, wrote articles\\, made videos\\, and spoke out about it. The audience score here PLUMMETED. I realized I wasn't being overly critical\\, that it was just an awful movie.\\nHow did Lucasfilm and their employees respond to this criticism? The audience score was hacked by bots. It's a small minority of vocal\\, bigoted fans (they even singled out a specific race and gender). They claimed there was nothing wrong with their movie\\, and you were wrong for thinking so. Rian Johnson was asked\\, based on the feedback from the fans\\, if in retrospect\\, he would have done anything differently with TLJ\\, and simply said \\\"No\\,\\\" Implying he felt it was perfect as is. He was rewarded by the studio with the opportunity to make a new Star Wars Trilogy.\\nSo\\, I have to ask:\\nWhy would I go see a movie that is made by a company that disrespected me so much as a fan?\\nWhy would I give my money to a company that had it's employees marginalize me over social media because I didn't like their latest creation?\\nHow can I give money to a company who feels there was nothing wrong with their last offering despite the overwhelming fan outcry? Who labeled anyone who didn't like the movie as a misogynist\\, a racist\\, and more?\\nWhy would I give my money to a company who is clearly no longer interested in making movies that would appeal to me?\\nSo\\, no\\, I did not see Solo\\, and at this point\\, I don't think I'll see Episode 9 either.","true":true}
