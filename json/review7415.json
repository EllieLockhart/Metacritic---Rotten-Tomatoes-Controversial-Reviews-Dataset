Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u00c9 um bom filme\\, que tenta mostrar a nova face que star wars busca\\, atrair o publico mais novo\\, para isso eles usam ferramentas cl\u00e1ssicas da franquia\\, a for\u00e7a \u00e9 demonstrada de varias formas\\, a principal delas \u00e9 mostrar que a for\u00e7a n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas esticar o bra\u00e7o e fazer for\u00e7a (algo que j\u00e1 foi apresentado nos filmes antigos)\\, mas sim se conectar com o mundo\\, isso \u00e9 algo muito bom do filme\\, as cenas de batalha s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis \\, principalmente uma que h\u00e1 lightsabers\\, duelos de X-wings vs Tie fighters s\u00e3o impressionantes\\, o prov\u00e1vel melhor filme da atual trilogia da saga. V\u00e1 ver e tire sua opini\u00e3o.","true":false}
