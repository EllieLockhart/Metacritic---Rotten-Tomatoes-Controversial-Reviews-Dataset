Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes place in a bizarro world where nothing you hold dear about Star Wars matters. Things that have made me a fan since childhood were thrown out like a dirty diaper. \\n\\nOn top of that the story did not seem like a continuation and there was little to no character development. \\n\\nI will always me a Star Wars fan but this movie derailed the entire franchise. \\n\\nI Hope the story will be salvaged and I can feel like a kid again watching the movies in the future.","true":true}
