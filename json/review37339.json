Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot was ok\\, the presentation was poor. To much hype was generated in the previous movies about key characters backstories for this movie to just brush it aside as if it's unimportant. There were good themes\\, and I did enjoy the movie\\, but there was nothing in it for me to be excited about for the next episode.","true":true}
