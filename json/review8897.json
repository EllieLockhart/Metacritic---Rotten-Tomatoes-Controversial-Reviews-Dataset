Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For those who somehow think that that the Empire Strikes Back is somehow better that the last Jedi and that Disney is not as good as the Lucas era... Just watch clips of this... to realize that you have just seen the best ever Star Wars film... Mark Hamill has transformed from the weakest link to the strongest link and should get an Oscar nomination!\\n\\nhttp:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/articles\/3GFTsFGQjqWk9RR35WFGh5c\/when-star-wars-got-it-awesomely-wrong-the-tv-holiday-special","true":true}
