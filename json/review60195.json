Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"first of all: I don't care wether this review gets a lot of \\\"non-helpful\\\" ratings as I know that this game got review-bombed and many haters\\, homophobics and people that didn't play the games for themselves are here to spread their hate.

And that's what haters gonna do - hate. Down-voting this and other positive reviews just underlines my statement anyway.\r\rI purchased the game on release day and somehow managed to play the game unspoiled and didnt hear about the leaks before. So I was really blind to the game - and that just might be the point. I ADORE every piece and part of this game. The characters are so detailed\\, vivid\\, emotional\\,... Naughty Dog just proved once more that there are geniusrd in character and animation design working there. The story is action\\, hatred\\, anger but also love and a little laughter and this already in the first 60minutes in game.\r\rJust as the first game totally changed my priciples (I'd never shoot an uninvolved doctor\\, not even in vid games\\, but **** it\\, i shot everyone at the fireflies in part I) this game managed to do this as well. First i HATED to play the second protagonist of the game but more and more\\, the character developed\\, i felt pity\\, i began to understand\\, i even cried for him\/her until everything merged together in an emotional roller-coaster-like climax.\r\rScrew the haters\\, as most of them didn't even played themselves or IF they did\\, they were already spoiled and made their bad opinion up in their head already - nothing could change these prejudiced people\\, they never gave the game a chance.\r\rPlay it yourself\\, unspoiled or try to let yourself into the journey unbiased and you WILL NOT regret it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
