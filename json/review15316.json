Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I live and breather Star Wars and this movie did not disappoint. Did it meet fan theories? No....but that's no reason to hate a great story with excellent characters. Do yourself a favour and just ENJOY the ride. After all\\, it's just a story and one that is a real treat!","true":true}
