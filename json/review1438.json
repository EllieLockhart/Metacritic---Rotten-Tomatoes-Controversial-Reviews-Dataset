Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan growing up watching the original trilogy I was so disappointed with The Last Jedi. The film rips up every plot line from The Force Awakens and totally destroys the character of Luke Skywalker!\\nAn amazing achievement. Looks like they are writing stories for a different audience now\\, congratulations Disney\\, I'm out!","true":true}
