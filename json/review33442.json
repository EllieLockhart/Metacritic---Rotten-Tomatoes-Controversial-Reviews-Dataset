Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Te people who are giving this movie bad reviews don't know what they're talking about. I'm not going to sit here and say that the movie was perfect\\, but it was moving and entertaining and overall a great addition to the franchise. Some of the cinematography was the best I've seen in a movie in years\\, and as always the acting was top notch from all parties. Not only was this movie worth my time\\, it's worth anyone's time whether or not they are a Star Wars fan or not.","true":true}
