Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Go See This Movie!!!! It's very entertaining from the first second to the last. I've been a big fan of Stars Wars since the first Stars Wars movie came out when I was a kid. I love this movie too! The plot and characters are great. This is a rare momement where I think the professional movie critics nailed it. ","true":true}
