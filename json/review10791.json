Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie of the franchise. Took everything that was set up in The Force Awakens and threw it right out the window. Plot was weak\\, no character development\\, slapstick humor was excessive and basically ruined this trilogy. I have absolutely no idea how JJ Abrams will make Episode 9 following this dumpster fire.","true":true}
