Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very sloppy and weak plot points\\, \\, many\\, many character inconsistencies\\, and total dismantling of the previous StarWars movie. Visually stunning\\, but ma'am has this franchise been headed in the wrong direction for a very long time. I'm pretty disappointed in the overall franchise at this point. Next movie\\, I might just wait for Redbox\\, if that. I grew up with this franchise\\, it's really a shame what Disney has done with it. ","true":true}
