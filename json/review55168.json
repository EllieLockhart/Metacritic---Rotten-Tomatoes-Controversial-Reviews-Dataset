Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with high hopes\\, they were dashed within the first 5 minutes. Awkward and un-necessary humour\\, terrible sub-plot involving a casino and some awful CGI rabbit-horses\\, under-developed wildcard character in the form of Benicio del Toro (what exactly does this character add to the story?)\\, introduction of a deeply annoying character in Rose (aka JarJar 2.0) and worst of all - Luke Skywalker. How could Rian Johnson take a beloved character and write such an awful story for him\\, I see why Hamill was frustrated. \\n\\nThe high(low) point for me was Rose crashing her speeder into Finn in order to stop him from sacrificing himself. 1) not physically possible given the speeds they were all going 2) just no.\\n\\nWoeful\\, cringeworthy and deeply frustrating instalment in the franchise.","true":true}
