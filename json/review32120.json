{"101487":169555,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers!!!!!  This is my rough first review\/reaction to The Last Jedi!  Do not read this if you have not seen the movie!!!!!!!\\n\\nOkay\\, this movie in my opinion is actually a very complicated film presenting a lot of subtle details that are easy to miss.  Having said that\\, this movie is a weird combination of literally the best Star Wars has ever been with some rough spots I did not like.  I'll start in no order but primarily start with what I liked.  \\n\\n(Spoilers!!!)\\n\\nOne\\, this movie felt like the first section of the movie and the last section of the movie were literally amazing.  In the beginning I loved the flight choreography with the X-Wings versus the Dread-not.  It was fresh\\, interesting\\, showed a combination of new and old angles and flight moves.  I loved the dialogue with the main resistance pilot mocking the First Order commander.  I liked seeing resistance fighters die often and I was okay with the bomber scenes.  I thought it was dumb though that the bomber had to catch the falling control release for the bombs as it was about to fall in space.  \\n\\nSecond\\, I loved the light saber fight scene with Rey and Kylo-Ren.  It was so visually impressive\\, camera angles were sick\\, again the choreography was probably the single best fight scene in all of Star Wars.  I was floored.  \\n\\nThird\\, the look of the film was way more cinematic\\, whether it was the beautiful use of color in Snoke's throne room\\, the clay flying everywhere at the last big fight scene\\, or with the cool long shots with Luke and a setting sun.  Stunning.\\n\\nFourth\\, I absolutely loved the last fight scene with Luke.  Star Wars has for too long only used the same boring force abilities for how many movies now while the books or games wrote in such cool force abilities.  It was obvious that the director had played through Knights of the Old Republic.  The use of force projection as a way to keep Luke at the island since he wanted to die there\\, to completely save the resistance and give them time\\, while just showing how powerful he actually was even in his decayed state was just so cool and poetic.  \\n\\nFifth\\, I really liked how they started to show how the difference between light and dark and how the force in general can impact one's perception.  How cool was it when they had that crazy reveal when Kylo-Ren told Rey that Luke tried to kill him in his sleep??  You end up thinking Luke created Kylo-Ren and end up thinking Luke is a bad guy or somehow dark.  But then you see Luke tell the story from his perspective and see that he knew Kylo-Ren was hitting a point of no return and was slipping into the dark side of the force and Luke was about to end him to prevent future deaths but then saw a piece of light still left in him and changed his mind in a state of immense guilt and shame\\, shame of failing as a teacher.  Just so cool.\\n\\nSixth\\, and I think a lot of people missed this.  A big theme in this film is out with old leaders and teachings because they have failed and are not applicable anymore.  I think most people interpreted this as oh you have to set the stage for the new characters.  It's more complicated than that.  Remember when Rey first tries to begin training with Luke and Luke guides her to sense the light side of the force?  Rey senses that but then senses the dark side and is willing to go there\\, but that freaks Luke out and reminds him of how he has failed Kylo-Ren and then ultimately his ineptitude as a force master instructor.  I believe that this was foreshadowing why Luke and Yoda are okay with torching the original Jedi manuscripts.  Because the Jedi teaching depicted in the films (not the books or games) only warn of a dark side\\, show only how to master light\\, and have outdated customs and teachings that have unintentionally led to Jedi falling to the dark side.  Rey represents the first future Jedi that could be grey\\, master of light and dark.  Luke could not do it and doesn't know how to teach it\\, Kylo-Ren could not\\, but Rey will likely be able to which will end up being her real true power.  Subtle but well done in my opinion.  \\n\\nSeventh\\, Kylo-Ren was sick\\, his look\\, his performance\\, he was not emo anymore and instead was killing\\, hurting\\, raging\\, and ultimately deceiving when he tricked everyone\\, including the audience by killing Snoke.  Loved it.  You think he's going light but instead falls even more dark.  Amazing.\\n\\nEighth\\, I loved the Rey scene where we see almost an infinite amount of Rey possibilities by seeing her reflection.  First it looked very Sci-fi\\, psychological\\, and tripped out.  Second\\, I felt like you could interpret this scene in a lot of ways which makes it cool.  I need to see this again but it seems like this was her just slowly tapping into her abilities\\, whether that is seeing the future\\, seeing all the different versions of herself on the light dark force continuum\\, or some kind of additional force abilities we have not seen yet.  Loved it.\\n\\nNinth\\, I actually liked how they used the various droids in the film.  They had useful abilities that didn't seem dumb\\, had personality\\, and were funny. \\n\\nTenth\\, I didn't have a problem with most of the humor.  I liked the various animals\\, geez those fuckin penguin\/bird animals were cute as shit and funny haha.  I liked the ice fox animals too.\\n\\nOkay\\, this is where I'll discuss what I hated about this movie.\\n\\nOne\\, there is a good 30 minutes in the middle of the film that could either be cut or re-filmed.  Very slow.  Didn't really add to anything.  And there could have been other things they could have used that time to show instead of forgettable filler scenes.\\n\\nTwo\\, you have got to be kidding me\\, Leia is in space and uses the force to survive and move herself to the ship door??  Omg that was fuckin dumb.  Horrible.  Yes Leia is force sensitive\\, but not like that.  Gross.  She can see the future\\, she can feel the force\\, but she is not trained.  It doesn't make sense.  Have her see her death or what could be her death but try to manipulate it\\, only to fail and be manipulated with being presented with false images or something by Snoke.  There are many ways they could have done something cool without it getting hooky.\\n\\nThree\\, why have dumb kids at the end of the film?  Seriously.  Luke dying\\, the Jedi teaching dying with him\\, the symbolism of what Luke represents and the reflection of how his bloodline and individual character has impacted the series and changed over time.  Thinking about all of that and reflecting on that emotionally at the end before he dies is how this should have ended.  That would have been dark.  I don't wanna see dumb kids with a rebel decoder ring.  Stupid.\\n\\nFour\\, uh Knights of Ren anyone?  What happened?  Who are they?  I had someone say that they could have been the red royal guards.  I don't think so.  Bringing that in instead of all the pointless filler in the middle of the film would have been better.  Missed opportunity.\\n\\nFive\\, I'm okay with Snoke dying the way he did\\, but I'm completely dissatisfied with his level of darkness. I never got a sense of shear rage and darkness.  I didn't see the dark side pulsing through his very soul.  He was cool but it was rushed.  They could have developed him more instead of again having dumb filler scenes in the middle of the film.  Again another missed opportunity.\\n\\nSix\\, there was next to no training scenes with Luke and Rey.  There was just briefly and while you can kind of justify it if you know Luke is unable to teach grey style of the force and now knows he thus should not teach anyone because he is realizing the old Jedi teachings are flawed.  They could have better developed this.  A little disappointed about that.\\n\\nSeven\\, this movie was unnecessarily political.  If you are going to chose to inject a political message in a film\\, unless that is the whole point of the film\\, I tend to prefer implied political messages.  Make it artistic.  Instead I felt like I was being preached to\\, with dumb simplistic platitudes of war and people selling war machines to both sides of the war\\, or over the moral decay of war and money.  It was simply unnecessary in a Star Wars movie.  Don't preach\\, creatively embed.  Annoying.\\n\\nEight\\, some of the delivery of lines between Rey and Luke and some of the scenes between Luke and Yoda seemed to not carry the weight\\, seriousness\\, and darkness that needed to be there.  It came across again a little hooky.  I didn't like the  Yoda scene.  Yes Yoda is portrayed as more crazy Yoda from the originals\\, but I mean come on\\, Yoda is seeing Luke at one of the darkest hours and near the end\\, with Luke knowing he will die using the force projection ability to save the resistance\\, with both of them knowing that the Jedi teachings were not only flawed and needed to be destroyed\\, but both Luke and Yoda knowing they have in many ways failed as individuals\\, while trying to do the best they could.  That is a big fuckin deal.  They should have crafted that scene with more care.  Instead\\, it felt like Muppets Take Manhattan.  Fuck.\\n\\nNine\\, I like that they were showing the force used in different ways\\, but I'm not sure I completely like how Kylo-Ren and Rey are able to just talk to each other over long distances.  It could have been cooler to have them communicate through images\\, broken thoughts\/emotions\\, while seeing each other's soul impacted\\, warped\\, changed\\, or disfigured by the force.  How cool would it have been to have Rey see Kylo-Ren's soul or energy representation of his body be warped and disfigured by the dark side with just pieces of light side or uncorrupted left.  Missed opportunity.\\n\\nTen\\, pet peeve.  Why have Rey have a dialogue line asking Kylo-Ren to put on a shirt while they were force talking?  Why does light side have to be chastity belt Rey lol.  Come on lol.  Light side can be sexy.  Annoying.  \\n\\nEleven\\, I was annoyed by the character that kisses Finn at the end before her death.  She was too cheesy.  I understand that Finn's character needed to have a play and contrast over how different people have responded to fear and the First Order and how it's not just the exceptional individuals that matter\\, but non exceptional people can have an impact and sometimes show more bravery.  Why couldn't they have depicted this with less teen sense of right and wrong and humor lol?  Come on.\\n\\nI need to see it again of course\\, but having said that\\, this is why I see this movie as a movie of extremes.  It is easily the most daring of all the Star Wars films.  I like filmmakers taking chances.  This needed to happen.  To be clear\\, I really like this movie.  I just wish some of the details were done better because what they got right was literally the best in the series.","true":true}
