Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was all over the place with the storyline. I feel like it would improve greatly if two thirds of it had been left on the cutting room floor.\\n\\nToo many poorly written\\, plot-hole ridden side stories that were inconsequential to the story.\\n\\nThe last 10-15 min are the best part of the movie. Everything else was mostly just some inane explosions.","true":true}
