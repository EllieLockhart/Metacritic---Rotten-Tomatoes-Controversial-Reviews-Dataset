Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi completely destroys the Star Wars Story and at the same time shows a true Hollywood agenda. Every male is shown to weak or evil. Every woman in the movie is a hero and strong. Without giving too much away let me just say that if you thought Rey not getting any training and being able to take down an injured Kylo Ren in the Force Awakens\\, prepare for it to become even more questionable. \\nThere are sub-plots that are completely useless to the movie and actually make it lose even more credibility.  There is a lack of lightsaber fights\\, in fact I am not sure that two lightsabers actually ever touch each other in this movie. \\nThe reason this got one star over half a star is because the shooting of this movie was done very well. There are a few scenes that are visually amazing\\, however I went to watch Star Wars\\, not Planet Earth.","true":true}
