Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could never live up to expectations but came awfully close. The fact of the matter is that it is nearly impossible to give a character 30 years of development without making some people mad with how the character developed. The special effects were beautiful\\, the plot twists were well done\\, and I actually found the comedy to be quite well done\\, which seems to be a polarizing opinion. I can understand people being frustrated by the story not going the way they expected\\, but there is no world in which this deserves a 56%.","true":true}
