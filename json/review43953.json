Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was the worst one so far. So many plot holes\\, uninteresting story lines\\, boring\\, not engaging\\, poor humor with even poorer timing. Waste of money to see this thing.","true":true}
