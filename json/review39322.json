Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is amazing\\, Awe inspiring. For those that usually feel laclusrte by the prospect of a new star wars film\\, then don't be discouraged\\, this is the film to turn you on! It is an amazing piece of cinema that... i dunno. It made me really in to star war for the first. (since i was never born in the  70's or 80's i obviously have no frame of reference) (Y)","true":true}
