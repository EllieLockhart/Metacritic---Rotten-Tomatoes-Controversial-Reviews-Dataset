Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals and action but severely lacking in a cohesive plot. Characters acted in ways that don't seem rational. I'll keep it short because if I go into detail I'll start adding spoilers. I'm not watching anymore Disney star wars films and I won't be bringing my children.","true":true}
