Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Minor spoiler review ahead:\\n\\nI didn't think it was as good as IV\\, V\\, or Rogue One\\, but TLJ was a solid and fresh installment in the saga. How you enjoy this film ultimately depends on what you want out of Star Wars. This film subverts a lot of normal Star Wars expectations\\, and because it is focused more on character arcs than developing the overall lore\\, some haters will complain it changes too much while other haters will complain in doesn't build much off VII. I thought Finn's arc and the casino setting was the weakest\\, and the political message about war felt very forced and hypocritical considering the whole economic premise of Star Wars is making money off of make-believe-war. What I do like: instead of a black and white depiction of good and evil\\, this film plays with themes of choice\\, failure\\, learning from mistakes\\, leaving the past behind\\, and forging one's own destiny for the future no matter to whom you are born. If you are into films that explore meta commentaries\\, you'll probably like this film. In this way\\, TLJ is somewhat of a thinking man's Star Wars. The less you are invested into fan theories\\, the more you will enjoy the film as well. There's lots of minor details I missed on the first watch\\, but after watching a second time I ended up liking the film more.\\n\\nOther plus points include the excellent visuals and Adam Driver's excellent acting and ability to portray a conflicted soul. This is how the fall to the dark side should have been portrayed in the PT.\\n\\nI feel people who complain about Phasma and Snoke's very short arcs are off-base are too easily forgetting the flaws of the OT. The emperor and Boba Fett were both barely developed in the OT.\\n\\nThe Leia-space moment thing was somewhat jarring and could have been portrayed better\\, but fulfills Luke's promise in VI that Leia would learn to use the Force.\\n\\nVery controversial for hardcore SW fans is Luke's arc. As a pretty hardcore SW fan myself\\, I was bummed to see Luke portrayed as so mean and depressed in this film...part of why I'm not giving 5 stars. However\\, this version of Luke works well with the meta commentaries mentioned above and is used as an (good) excuse to bring everyone's favorite little green alien into the film. Mark Hamill's acting with this new complicated version of Luke was excellent. While somewhat abrupt\\, I thought the way Luke's arc ends was very beautiful and poetic. The last scene of the film is trying to show that Luke becomes a legend that will inspire future heroes to rise up in the galaxy.","true":true}
