{"101487":114391,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Critics Consensus: Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\"\\n\\n^^^ That is an outright lie. The Last Jedi did not honor Star Wars legacy at all. The biggest thing I could see was a giant middle finger to The Force Awakens. It mockingly destroys every plot point brought up before this movie.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, the movie wasn't horrible it's just that it wasn't good either.  The visuals were stunningly beautiful and the sound was excellent. The plot\\, or lack of\\, is the biggest problem. The writing was also lazy and horrible.\\n\\nWas there a feminist agenda? Some people claim yes. If there was\\, they did a really bad job of it. All the women in TLJ were horribly written and very shallow. \\n\\nLuke Skywalker - Badass Jedi? Nope\\, grumpy old man that doesn't believe in good any more. I get that Disney wants to move forward and leave the original characters behind. That's fine. But if Luke is going to die\\, why couldn't he really fight Kylo Ren and be defeated by the Dark Side? THAT\\, would have been good controversy. \\n\\nRey - Badass woman\\, because you know\\, magic. She had known about the Force for all of 3 days and can beat a guy that has trained for YEARS with the most badass Jedi of all time\\, and also trained at least a little by Snoke. She is a nobody from nowhere? Fine\\, nothing wrong with that. But knowing things by magic is just poor and lazy writing.\\n\\nPoe Dameron - Best pilot in the galaxy? But he's bad and stupid because he is a man. Retarded logic. At least he was actively trying to save the Rebellion\/Resistance.\\n\\nFinn - Also bad and stupid because he is a man. This leads to the pointless subplot\\, why? The only thing it accomplishes is more woe for the Rebels. Lazy writing.\\n\\nKylo Ren - Probably the only good character in the entire movie. He is emotional and unstable\\, that's great. I actually like that. It flows with the plot that he was turned or seduced by the Dark Side.\\n\\nLeia - wow\\, what a shake my head character in this movie. She can survive the vacuum of space and Mary Poppins back to the ship because... she is a woman and needs no explanation. It's almost a disgrace to the memory of Carrie Fisher. I mean she passed while this movie was being made. That would have been an excellent time to write her out of the story with dignity.\\n\\nAdmiral Purple Hair - Commander of the Rebels... because she is a woman. Good leaders do just that\\, lead. Subordinates trust them and follow orders. She had a disregard for Poe because he was a man. There was no need to let her people know the plan? That only created more havoc than good. \\n\\nCaptain Phasma - Good lord! Why hire an actress like Gwendolyn Christie and not use her? There was so much potential there! Again\\, I think this was a knee to the groin of The Force Awakens. She was on screen for less time than TFA!\\n\\nChewbacca - I'm surprised they didn't kill him too.\\n\\nC3PO - What happened to the red arm?\\n\\nR2D2 - one of the only truly great scenes in the movie\\, which was also just a rehash\/replay of A New Hope.\\n\\nAdmiral Akbar - dies (?) off screen\\, nothing to see here...\\n\\nRose - almost a good character\\, but involved in the pointless subplot. She stops Finn from sacrificing himself for the greater good because \\\"to win save the ones you love\\, not kill the things you hate.\\\" Great message\\, but you just killed all of your Rebel buddies because the cannon now fires on the base. And love? They knew each other for like what\\, 12 hours?\\n\\nTerrible\\, terrible lazy writing. \\n\\nThe Good\\n* Visuals\\, sets\\, and sound\\n* Finding the map that leads to Luke\\n* The Force connection between Kylo and Rey\\n* Force projection\\n\\nThe Bad\\n* Pointless subplots\\n* Poor writing\\, script\\, dialog\\n* Casino planet\\n\\nThe Ugly\\n* Seacow Alien Milk\\n* Poorly timed jokes and one-liners\\n* Snoke - unimportant bad guy\\n* Luke's heart attack","true":true}
