Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lazy writing.. terrible plot-holes!\\nRian Johnson\\, JJ Abrams = terrible lazy writing at its best!.. plot-holes galore!.. no payoff for the \\\"mystery boxes\\\"!\\n.. I swear JJ emailed Johnson and said just get me out of what I wrote because I wrote a terrible script in TFA and left star wars with unfinished ideas and no story arc... I just made it up as I went along.. I borrowed from the internet and other movies (which is what I do) and then threw it it in a blender and stood on the shoulders of giants and called it my own (Jpark reference)\\\"......this is what the fans are pissed off about. That they JJ and Johnson (which sounds like a pharmaceutical company or at worse a law firm) dropped the ball.. They had such potential to come up with great ideas but sadly the hacks that they are came floating to the top.","true":true}
