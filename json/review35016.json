Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film works and presents some unexpected turn of events throughout the storyline even if it gives such a sense of familiarity I love.\\nIt deserves to be watched again and again. I am sure I have missed something. But the cinematography was just pure pleasure to the eye. All the fast and slow mos so clear\\, so sharp.","true":true}
