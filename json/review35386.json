Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi\\, a film with so much promise but falls so far with the sad clump of Snokes corpse and underused character development. A film bristling with sub plots that are inconsequential and differ to the arc set out by Force Awakens\\, that ultimately offer no logical character development. A film that blasts away the mystery and awe left by its predecessor\\, and shows its loyal\\, theory conniving audience that nothing is going to be linked to what they thought.\\nA film\\, that pays homage to one of my all time idols\\, with what I can only describe as the most ludicrous and unfortunately hilarious of endings.\\n\\nAll I can say is\\, JJ\\, I would like to think this was not your intended storyline from the beginning. I would like to think that Rian blindsided your concepts and simply betrayed your vision of the new characters.\\nI hope\\, you are the spark\\, that brings about episode nines triumphant return.","true":true}
