Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start?  Luke goes out like a BITCH. Only two lessons out of three given to Rae. The primary plot was weak\\, the secondary plot was worse. Snoke is and will forever be a mystery to us all.  They continue killing off our favorite characters while force feeding us new ones whom are dull and uninteresting. Did I mention Luke goes out like a bitch?  Terrible film.  Two stars\\, if only because it's a Star Wars film..","true":true}
