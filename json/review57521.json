Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an Amazing movie there was so much awesomeness in this movie that it just made everyone forget about the bad prequels\\, and that was the goal to erase everything that the prequels did wrong. So over all this was an amazing movie with tons of non stop fun and a lot of questions  got answered\\, it was a great movie with a lot of screen time for all the characters and even a lot more screen time for Rey. The story for the last Jedi was fun intriguing and the characters story's in this movie was amazing. The last Jedi was by far the best Star Wars movie by far","true":true}
