Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars Movie! Plot was completely convoluted and made no sense? The acting and visuals were amazing but besides that the characters were completely unbelievable. The interesting twists were delivered horribly. Please do not spend any money on this. Bootleg this movie or wait till it goes on Netflix. Disney needs to know that we are not happy! And no I am not a troll\\, a Trump supporter\\, a bot\\, or a super nerdy fanboy? I am a Star Wars fan but a movie lover who was very displeased at the direction this franchise took. SMFH","true":true}
