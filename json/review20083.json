Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was more original and interesting than Force Awakens but had parts that were boring and seem unnecessary (the casino planet). But Mark Hamill is a complete badass as Luke and the porgs aren\u2019t nearly as annoying as you thought they would be.","true":true}
