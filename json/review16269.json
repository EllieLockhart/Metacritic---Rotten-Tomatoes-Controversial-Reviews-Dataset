Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not giving this 5 stars because it was perfect. This is not a perfect film. I'm giving it 5 stars because it completely took me by surprise in all the right ways. I had a fantastic experience watching this and I cannot wait to go back three or four more times!","true":true}
