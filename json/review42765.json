Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrid--PC\/social justice warrior\/garbage.  Rain Johnson basically turned a wonderful franchise into something unrecognizable.  He and Disney killed Star Wars and are now becoming enormously wealthy from its rotting corpse.  From poor script\\, stupid jokes\\, plot holes the size of galaxies\\, and wasted characters (Luke's treatment was unforgivable) I wish that I would have never given my hard earned money to these (Disney) wealthy scum.","true":true}
