Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not a movie for the older generations of fans. Its a movie for the critics. Its a movie for the new generation of fans and the children that are currently playing with the new toys. The writers and creaters behind the scenes either got lazy\\, or really wanted to erase what made star wars so good for the older generations. This movie was more focused on weakening and erasing the memorable characters that gave star wars the magic it once had\\, in order to force us to accept the new generation of characters that most star wars fans honestly dislike. This movie is not for the Skywalker fans\\, the solo or ever the Vader fans. This movie is for the  kylo ren\\, the rey and the fin fans. This movie is great for those who are just joining the fan base and those new to the series. If you however are a fan who is heavily invested in the more and the potential a movie like this would have before Disney bought it out\\, then you will walk away disappointed. Disney made it very clear in this movie that they don't care about the fans of the Lucas films. This was more of a way to make a statement. The statement is\\, we own star wars now\\, our characters are the only ones that matter so love them more than you ever loved the older ones","true":true}
