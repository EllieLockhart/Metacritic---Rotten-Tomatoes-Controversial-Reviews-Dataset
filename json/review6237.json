Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has ruined this franchise\\, this was worse than the prequels bring back George as a consultant & listen to his advice about the fundamentals of Star Wars and the characters (that's not a joke) this is the worst film of the series even the Clone Wars animation film was better than this. But the best bit? They have rewarded the Director Rian Johnson with his own Star Wars trilogy. NNoooooooooooooooo!!!","true":true}
