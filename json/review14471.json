Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated it. I just thought the story went nowhere\\, the galaxy seemed very small and pathetic\\, the OT characters were under-served\\, nothing new\\, big meh! \\n\\nIt's like they took the wrong lesson from the prequels and have decided to avoid at all costs any world building or exposition or attempt to make the universe a coherent\\, believable place or to make sense of what the force is or to introduce anything new\\, just because Lucas so completely failed at doing those things.\\n\\nInstead of any expansion or true explanation\\, we have a weird treading-water universe that just repeats the same cycles\\, never growing or learning anything new\\, the old heroes replaced by newer models\\, seemingly forever. They say as much multiple times in this one\\, I guess in a kind of sad\\, resigned gesture toward lampshading or something.","true":true}
