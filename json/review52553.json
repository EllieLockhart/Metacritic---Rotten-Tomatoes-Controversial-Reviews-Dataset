Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A jarring two and a half hour film that somehow feels rushed without actually advancing the plot in a meaningful or believable way. Completely disregards the themes of the original trilogy and the character arcs set up by The Force Awakens. Super disappointed.","true":true}
