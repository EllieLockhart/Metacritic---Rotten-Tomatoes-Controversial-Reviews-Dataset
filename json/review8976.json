Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From start to finish.  So many things that did not even make common sense.  Bomb's dropping down in space ??  A whole armada of Star Destroyers who were the bad ass ship's of the empire\\, just do nothing but watch a huge dreadnaught class ship fight..  on and on things that don't flow with common sense.\\n\\nAn ending that didn't leave me wanting to see the next episode.  All previous 7 at least gave me that urge. This one just was left a sour taste in my mouth and feel I had a better time watching Justice League.\\n\\nSo now the whole Skywalker family is dead...  The major side story between Jedi and Dark Jedi is gone.  What's left is just a huge boring war you can watch by  playing battlefront...","true":true}
