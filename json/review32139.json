Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[SPOILERS]  Why? Why? Why Disney ruined it?  I was a huge fan of SW.  This last movie does not capture the magic of the old series. Confusing\\, dialogues boring\\, the humour is forced and falls flaty\\,  twists do not make no sense.... Many holes in the plot\\, the story line was lazy.  Luke Skywalker is portrayed as weak\\, uncaring and willing to attempt to kill his nephew in his sleep - which he would never do\\, or even think of doing - especially someone unarmed.  \\nThis movie is out of context from what Lucas originally created. I'm disappointed.....","true":true}
