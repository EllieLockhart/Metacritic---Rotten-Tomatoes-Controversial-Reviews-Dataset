Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this movie had 30 less minutes of Canto Bight I would have given it a five star review. Less of a matinee homage than the original trilogy\\, this installment surprised us and gives the franchise room to expand both in storyline and cinematic stylings. A flawed masterpiece that is better on the whole than Return of the Jedi.Wholly enjoyable.","true":true}
