Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this Star Wars. If you want to see an exact copy of the original trilogy\\, than rewatch them. The new direction was needed and it still felt like a Star Wars film. You're not children anymore and it's not supposed to make you feel like the originals did when you were eight.","true":true}
