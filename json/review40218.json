Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the best star wars movie i have ever seen\\, however\\, it is far from the worst. The fact that this movie has a 57% at the moment is baffling. People didn't like the force awakens because it was too similar to episode IV\\, but now this film is bad because it's too different? There is a fair amount in this film that could be changes\\, specifically the entire Finn\/Girl who's name i cant even remember story line\\, but does that make this the worst star wars film? No. Not even close.","true":true}
