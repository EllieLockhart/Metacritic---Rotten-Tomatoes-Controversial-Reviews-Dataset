Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely stunning. I never expected a Star Wars movie to surprise me over and over in the way that The Last Jedi did. This isn't just the best Star Wars movie ever made\\, it's one of the best blockbuster movies ever put to film. Truly incredible.","true":true}
