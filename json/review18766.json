Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a good movie!  Star Wars fans are just nuts \\\"Batman & \\\" Robin\\\" is a 1 star movie\\, this is not!   This movie takes turns many a die hard fan wil hate and love\\,  we do not own Star Wars if it does not meet expectations dont give it a emotional 1 star as it does not reflect the quality of the movie!  I loved this version of Star Wars even if it is new and different\\, time to let go of the past\\, let die ;)","true":true}
