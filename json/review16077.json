Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"im a new fans of star wars ! force awakens brought me to this big amazing family and the last jedi was my personal favourite movie in this saga !!!!!","true":true}
