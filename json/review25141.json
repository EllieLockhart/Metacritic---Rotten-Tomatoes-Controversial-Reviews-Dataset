Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never in any recess of my mind did I think this movie could possibly be worse than the garbage heap that was the TFA\\, with all the amazing directions they couldve went with this movie I was actually very hopeful Rian would actually pull off creating the best Star Wars film of all time.   But instead they failed and underdelivered in virtually every aspect of storytelling imaginable. I no longer have any faith in Disney in regards to this franchise\\, in my book.... there are only 6 STAR WARS films. #BringBackLucas","true":true}
