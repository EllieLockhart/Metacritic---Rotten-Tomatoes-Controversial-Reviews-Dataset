Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This new series\\, and Last Jedi in particular\\, are giving Star Wars fans that grew up with Episodes I II and III the same feeling that those films did to original fanatics. The most notable grain of salt is that these films are are partially a continuation\\, but also a necessary attempt for Disney to indoctrinate a brand new generation into the Star Wars universe. While this movie will give fans of previous films a somewhat baffled or frustrated feeling of the changes going on in a galaxy far far away\\, it is at the end\\, very satisfying.","true":true}
