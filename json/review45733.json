Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very good movie overall. I felt that some times the tension that makes the Star Wars movies so good was too often diffused by unnecessary comedy. It works in some movies\\, not Star Wars.","true":true}
