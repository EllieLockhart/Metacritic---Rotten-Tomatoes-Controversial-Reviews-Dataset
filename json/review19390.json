Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's sad that a toxic minority has decided to die on the hill that The Last Jedi isn't a great film. Critics and audience agree that the film is a masterpiece. Whatever happened to not liking something and not trying to ruin it for everyone else. The source of many of these 1 star reviews is hate.","true":true}
