Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since Empire Strikes Back came out.  Of course the original trilogy was the bomb.  The prequels aren't as bad I just wish they didn't use 95% of it CGI.  I did enjoy The Force Awakens.  I know they played it safe but I think it worked.  Now The Last Jedi\\, I think it ranked near the bottom of my order of my ratings for each movie.  It dragged in the beginning\\, and when it got good it killed story lines from Force Awakens.  It was kind of like a Pirate of the Carribean movie with the humor.  Shame on the director for not making this flow.  An come on Leia flying through outer space.  That did it for me.","true":true}
