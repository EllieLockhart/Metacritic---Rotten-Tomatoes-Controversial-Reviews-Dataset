Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stole this review from someone else\\, but it sums up how I feel. \\nThe humor is horrible.... worse after somone is killed and we get to hear BB8 make comical noises... The plot..what plot\\, it is a terrible written story\\, it is all overthe place with no point.\\n\\nAll the previous films and movies are now tossed out the window and redundant. To be a jedi master is 2 days ..or less\\, Leia is a more poweful jedi \/ Sith than Darth Plagueis \\\"The Wise\\\"...and with no training.\\n\\nThe kid at the end with his broom.... no training at all\\, but can do what took Aniken years to master.....\\n\\nThe rebelion...after destroying 2 dearth stars\\, the emperor\\, the First order planet killer...and no one in the galaxy will help them ? What do these people need to do for have a little support ?? They have no ships and no fuel\\, at the end down to less than 400 people....and the big plan...to hide behind a big door and ..wait for a miracle ? if people did not want to help\\, when the rebelion was at its best\\, no one is coming at its worst.\\n\\nif Snoke is all powerful\\, why was not some mention of him in any previous star wars literature...he came from somewhere....how\\, where\\, what ?? \\n\\nRose and Finn.... good characters...\\, not the best\\, but ok...but the stupid casimno planet... OMG what a waste.\\n\\nNever have I seen a such poorly writen and produced movie. Yes\\, visuals are good.... but that is not enough to make up for all the other abundant errors.\\n\\nI can not even talk about that was done with Luke. The man that could spare Darth Vader life\\, was going to kill his own neppew because he might be on the path to the dark side...maybe ..?? What ?? What will he have said to Leia and Han... \\\" Oh\\, yeah\\, sorry Ben was bad\\, I had to kill him...sorry \\\"\\n\\nOn\\, and on and on.\\n\\nAgain i say to all of you saying it is the best of movies....why ? how can you say that. tell us all that are confused what you found good abougt it... please..help me undersftand because I have no cluse at all.\\n\\nWorst star wars movie\\,","true":true}
