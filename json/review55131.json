Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was shell-shocked after this movie and deeply in need of a glass of red wine.  That being said - I also need to go see it again.  One oddity is the flashback scenes in Awakens - have all these flashbacks been covered in Last Jedi? ! - and oddly there doesn't seem to be a pre-ordained character arc through three movies already designed or set out from the first movie that simply carried through.  Hamill's performance was likely shaped by the fact that this isn't a story he personally wanted\\, one in which Luke is grumpier\\, and in general simply \\\"less\\\".  That being said - the final part of the film\\, Luke is literally akin to a God\\, and a legend is born.","true":true}
