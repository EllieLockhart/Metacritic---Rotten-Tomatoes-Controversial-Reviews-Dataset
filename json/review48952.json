Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever made\\, completely destroyed everything Luke stands for and believes in. Characters constantly making stupid decisions and lets not forget space Leia. Not fit enough to have the Star Wars name in the title.","true":true}
