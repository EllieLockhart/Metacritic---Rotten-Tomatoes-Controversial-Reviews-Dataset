Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's clearly made more towards a foreign audience. Having lasting villains and threats through the trilogy like in the original series is a thing of the past. Now everything is just \\\"villain of the week\\\". Like remember how The Emperor was a constant enemy through the series? Remember how cool it was when he died? Yeah compare that to the new series and you can tell why the score is so low","true":true}
