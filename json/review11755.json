Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How Disney\\, chooses their directors I really have no idea.\\nThis for me is the least enjoyable of all the Star Wars films. I'm not a rabid fan but I do enjoy Empire and Return as classics.\\n- Finn is boring and a completely pointless subplot\\n- Rose \\, useless\\n-Rei\\, annoying\\n- Luke....That's not Luke Skywalker.\\nYou cannot suddenly twist the character into something new to suit your agenda and then expect fans to be happy with it.","true":true}
