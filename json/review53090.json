Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As you watch this movie\\, you get the sinking feeling that the writer\/director didn't take the time to learn the history or lore of the past stories\\, or even seen the original trilogy and had simple cliffnotes of the previous outing. \\n\\nFrom WWII bombers in space (Where was the Y-Wings\\, exactly?) at the beginning to the slow spaceship chase scene that lasted for two thirds of the film\\, Star Wars The Last Jedi spits on the legacy that came before and then hacks up a political diatrade of ill defined characters with paper thin motives\\, while blacking the eye of existing characters and have them mired in a story that goes nowhere. \\n\\nThis is the worst Star Wars movie ever put to film\\, and I would rather fire up the Holiday special than see this again.","true":true}
