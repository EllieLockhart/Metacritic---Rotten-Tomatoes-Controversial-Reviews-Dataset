Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed.  Nothing on Snoke's background\\, cheesy scenes\\, unnecessary plots.  No emotion felt in any of the points that should have been emotional.  Some good parts\\, but nothing answered and not feeling excited for Ep 9.  I am hoping a second viewing will help me feel better about it.","true":true}
