Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't even think of a bad thing to say about this movie. The three aspects I loved most about the movie were:\\n1) It did NOT copy Empire Strikes Back. This is original material here...unlike the Force Awakens.\\n2) It moves at a reasonable pace...unlike the blistering pace of The Force Awakens. It allows dialogue and character development.\\n3) It does not fall victim to cliches. When you think\\, \\\"oh this is going to happen now like all other movies\\,\\\" it fortunately does not.\\nI highly recommend this installment!","true":true}
