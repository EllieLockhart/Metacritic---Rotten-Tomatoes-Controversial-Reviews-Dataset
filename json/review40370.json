Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, quite simply\\, a dreadful film in every conceivable way. The future of Star Wars rest on the shoulders of JJ Abrams with Episode 9. Imagine someone at Disney\/Lucasfilm looking at this pile of utter nonsense and thinking it was a great film? What were they smoking? Force Awakens was brilliant and introduced new characters whilst paying homage to the past. This one completely undermines everything that the Force Awakens achieved. It's like Rian Johnson secretly hates Star Wars and single-handedly set about destroying it. It wasn't clever\\, creative or intelligent\\, it was a lazy effort. If anyone can save this mess it'll be JJ Abrams.","true":true}
