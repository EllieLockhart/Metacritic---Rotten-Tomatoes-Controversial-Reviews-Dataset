{"101487":133010,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it 3\/5 stars.\\n\\nBeautiful shots and special effects\\, don't like what they did with Luke or Snoke. I did like what they did with Kylo. On the fence with Rey. Finn and Rose did not feel necessary. BB-8 reminds me of R2D2's portrayal in the Cartoon Network Clone Wars Cartoon. I'd say more put that would be spoiler territory. A little better than Force Awakens. Actually\\, much better.\\n\\nKids will love it. New Star wars fans will love it. Old Star wars fans will be divided about it.\\n\\nNow for spoilers and specifics:\\n\\nPro's:\\n\\n-The coolest scene in the film was the spaceship going lightspeed into Snoke's ship.\\n\\n-Rey and Kylo's fight with Snoke's guards especially the bit were Rey threw the saber and he caught it in just the right way to ignite it through a helmet.\\n\\n-Rey's and Kylo's force Skype chats.\\n\\n-The portrayal of Kylo Ren in this film. They got it right finally.\\n\\n-Adm. Holdo shutting Poe down.\\n\\n-Gen. Leia slapping and demoting Poe. Oh\\, and General Leia in general. I like almost everything they have done with her in the film. It feels right.\\n\\n-Luke's Force projection technique.\\n\\n-Strong Female leads.\\n\\n-The porgs. Yes\\, I liked them.\\n\\n-The salt planet was really cool.\\n\\nMeh's:\\n\\n-Most of the humor fell flat. It did not feel like Star wars humor. It was always incidental. The Chewbacca and Porg moments felt natural. Chewbacca is a big fuzz ball of warmth\\, loyalty\\, and muscle. I could totally see him feeling guilty about eating a Porg. The stuffy old caretakers\\, the bit about the stone rolling down the hill and taking out their cart\\, the green boob milk\\, it just didn't feel right for the franchise. It felt like Marvel.\\n\\n-The whole Canto Bright subplot\\, it made the movie feel bloated. I could have done without it.\\n\\n-Also\\, I can't explain why\\, but Finn and Rose just felt unnecessary in this film. Might be related to the subplot that they featured in\\, feeling pointless.\\n\\n-Whats going on with the rest of the galaxy? Done poorly in the prequels and very well in the Clone Wars cartoons\\, but both made you understand how the Clone Wars was a galactic conflict in scale.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-Numero Uno: Luke Skywalker. I did not like their protrayal of Luke Skywalker. I have a hard time believing it's the same character. Think about it. In the Empire strikes back\\, he and the rebellion failed time and time again. Many rebels (some Bothan I assume) died\\, Hoth was lost\\, the Rebellion retreated to the Outer Rim and not even to a base\\, but to somewhere at the edge of the galaxy. C3PO was dismantled\\, Han frozen\\, Luke lost his hand and his naivety. Did he retreat? Yep. He retreated and trained. He then\\, after a few years\\, confronted his father. After almost giving in to the dark side and killing his father\\, but threw away his lightsaber and pleaded to the better nature of his father. He almost died in the attempt\\, but the Anakin responded and over threw the Emperor.\\n\\nHaving Luke give into fear and even think about killing Ben totally makes that lesson useless. Having Luke give up after the order dies out again is again out of character. The Luke we knew in the old trilogy would have licked his wounds and tried again\\, perhaps in a different way. Who knows. Of course\\, the order would not have died out again if Luke had not acted out of character and raised his lightsaber to his nephew. I don't know who Mark Hamill was playing\\, but it was not Luke.\\n\\n-Speaking of old Jedi\\, where were Yoda\\, Obi-Wan\\, and Anakin. Or even Qui-Gon. All four are still alive in the force despite being physically dead and three of those four are capable of manifesting as Force Ghosts. It's implied in the Yoda scene that he has not visited Luke since Endor. I can not see Yoda\\, Obi-Wan\\, or Anakin leaving Luke on his own when he still needed their guidance. He should have been able to talk with them of even have them talk with Kylo about his decisions. Anakin knew the dangers of giving into the dark and should have been able to provide guidance on that issue.\\n\\n-Rey\\, this may be controversial\\, but I am still not sold on her. I have absolutely no problems with her ability with the lightsaber. I know from reading enough things about knights as a kid that there is a lot of transferrable skill from swords to pole weapons. Her pole skills and force sensitivity would be more than enough to beat the average non-force user in combat.\\n\\nThat being said\\, how can she lift so many rocks? How can she use force push and force pull so well? Every prior force sensitive in the series had to train for at least a few months to a few years before showing any skill in that. As a child all Anakin was able to do was fly better than any human had a right to fly. Luke had the same piloting skills. By the second filmin their respective trilogies\\, both Anakin and Luke had learned some force skills. Specifically\\, the leviation bits\\, however Luke still was not able to lift his x-wing. Luke himself was not able to do the mind trick stuff until the third film despite seeing Obi-Wan do so in the original movie.\\n\\n-Speaking of Force skills\\, Leia flying through space was absurd. I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n-Snoke: All that build up in the books and through their promotional materials for two years and we know no more about the guy. All we know is his like for Disco fashion and bad guy monologues. Oh and that he is capable of some cool force powers. Where did he come from? How did he gain control of the first order? How did he and Kylo first meet up?\\n\\n-Captain Phasma. Let's hope she stays dead.\\n\\nNitpicks (meaning these have no bearing on the rating I gave the score):\\n\\n-Why does Admiral Holdo not wear a uniform of some sort? Every other female is. Well\\, not Leia\\, but I see her as more of a political figure and not a military. Like the American President. She is ultimately in charge\\, but is a civilian and dresses like one.\\n\\nEdit: Something I thought about\\, and this is opinion\\, the original trilogy were a series of good and great ideas executed well\\, the prequels were mostly good ideas executed poorly\\, and the sequels are mostly bad ideas executed well. Just my opinion.","true":true}
