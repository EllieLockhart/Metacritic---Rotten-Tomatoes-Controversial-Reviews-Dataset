Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely destroys the legacy of the original trilogy and its characters. It's one thing to move the story past them.  It's another to say what they did basically didn't matter in the long run and that they're failures. This would barely be enough of a story to be a filler TV show.  The original six movies felt huge in scope and how the Skywalker family affected the galaxy.  This trilogy is about how the galaxy affects the handful of characters Disney cares about.","true":true}
