Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did't like the movie in general\\, I didn't like the plot and not because it was meant to be for young kids. Just take a look at \\\"Ponyo\\\"\\, just to mention one. I didn't like because when anything is possible (see all those new force power\\, escape maneuvers\\, and suspense of disbelief)\\, then nothing makes sense anymore. And I don't care if actors' performances were good and special effects perfect\\, there was never a sense of reality\\, I never felt the struggle of characters. And supermen Leia... C'mon\\, really!?!?","true":true}
