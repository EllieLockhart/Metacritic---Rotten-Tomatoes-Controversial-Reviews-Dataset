Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fan...but this wasn\u2019t Star Wars. Of course you have to see it since it\u2019s a Star Wars movie but I\u2019ve never been so disappointed in my life after a movie. The plot and characters were terrible for the most part. I hate the direction of where Rian Johnson took this movie. I just hope somehow JJ Abrams can save the trilogy with IX. ","true":true}
