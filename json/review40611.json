Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever. The visuals are good\\, the action scenes are okay\\, but the writing and plotlines are utter garbage. A lot of plot holes\\, it destroys what The Force Awakens built. The forced \\\"feminist\\\" message on top would have been ok if it didn't ruin characters and entire plot lines. This is really a shame.","true":true}
