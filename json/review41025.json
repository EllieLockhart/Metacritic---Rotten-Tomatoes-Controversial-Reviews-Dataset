Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie feels like it was made by someone who loves Star Wars\\, but also has a snarkier and more sarcastic sense of humor. It's tonally a bit different\\, but I loved it.","true":true}
