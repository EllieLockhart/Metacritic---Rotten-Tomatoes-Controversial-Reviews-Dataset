Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was very excited for the release of this movie! It had so much potential! Sadly plots and sub plots were all over the place\\, comedic value felt forced and the first half of the move drug on only to have our childhoods and our childrens child hoods go out\/ring in with a whimper opposed to a bang. Suddenly in contrast Episode one and two seem like classics.","true":true}
