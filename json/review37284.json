Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot holes are massive and the movie destroys the best elements of the original movies. I went to this film with such hope because there were so much plot points that could be developed. However\\, disapointment ensued where any vestige of hope resided. Also one of my main complaints is the situational premise of the start of the film: Two ships\\, in the vacuum of space\\, both ships travelling at \\\"top speed\\\"\\, how is it possible that one ship is in danger of catching up with the other? I understand that this is fantasy but I can't help but think that some basic science should be applied. Other than that all your favourite characters will be reduced to ruins without explanation. 1 star for cinematography.","true":true}
