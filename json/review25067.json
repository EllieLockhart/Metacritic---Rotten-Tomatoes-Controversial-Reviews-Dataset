Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"****\\nAfter the disappointingly familiar 'The Force Awakens' and the bland\\, emptiness that was 'Rogue One'\\, Disney have finally delivered their first positively good Star Wars movie. Whilst 'The Force Awakens' was fine\\, and I gave it a positive review\\, I was still really disappointed by that one. With 'The Last Jedi'\\, and my expectations in check\\, I found it to be a much more rewarding experience. Writer\/Director Rian Johnson has finally taken some risks\\, and has produced something new and different; at least as much as you can when a franchise reaches its eighth (or ninth) instalment. Not everything works\\, and I had a hard time choosing a rating honestly. The film is definitely too long\\, and half an hour could probably have been cut - and a good place to start would have been the casino-planet sub plot which\\, although necessary in the end\\, felt out of place when watching the movie. There's also a few tonal issues\\, and the pacing in the first act is a bit iffy\\, but those are just minor nitpicks. What Johnson does deliver however are some spectacular action sequences\\, particularly a fight involving some red guards\\, and some honest-to-god surprises that I truly did not expect. All the characters have an arc\\, and are certainly different by the end of the movie than they were at the beginning. The performances are typically excellent\\, and some characters were taken in some rather daring directions which I loved\\, but some die-hard fans are having a problem with. Ultimately\\, it's not without flaws and far from perfect\\, but this is the kind of Star Wars movie I want to see - daring\\, bold and not afraid to take some risks.","true":true}
