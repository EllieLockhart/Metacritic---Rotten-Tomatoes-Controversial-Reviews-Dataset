Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Context: I am 34 years old. Up until very recently\\, I had never seen any of the Star Wars films. I had\\, of course\\, been exposed to the epic quotes\/scenes\/memes\/etc.\\, but I had not watched the movies\\, until a weekend Star Wars binge fest. Based on a coworker\/rabid fan's recommendation\\, I watched them in this order: Rogue\\, 4\\, 5\\, 1\\, 2\\, 3\\, 6\\, 7\\, 8.\\nTo this outsider looking in\\, The Last Jedi can be summed up in one word: \\\"Why?\\\" \\n - Rian needing zero personal\/character growth: Why?\\n - General Hux turning into a pair of clown shoes: Why?\\n - Casino & space horse scene: Why?\\n - Holdo using the time honored military command strategy of not telling your subordinates your plans until the very last moment\\, inciting mutiny: Why?\\n - Apparently the jump to hyperspace can destroy ships: Why?\\n - Rose\\, every moment of Rose: Why?\\n - Space bombers: Why?\\n - Leia is space-proof: Why?\\n - The jarring moments of Idiocracy \\\"Ow My Balls\\\" humor: Why?\\n - Taking the indomitable Luke Skywalker that honestly gave me goosebumps as he faces Vader in that silhouette poster shot in Empire Strikes Back and making him into some emo old man that can't stop feeling sorry for himself for most of the movie: WHY GOD WHY?\\nI'm not an entrenched hardcore fanboy\\, so if Disney wants to take the Star Wars franchise in a new direction\\, power to you-but could that direction 1) make sense and 2) not be run by a group of people that apparently hate Star Wars?\\nThe red sand planet was pretty cool though. 1.5 stars.","true":true}
