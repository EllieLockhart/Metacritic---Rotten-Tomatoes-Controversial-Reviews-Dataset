Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i feel like it was a very well crafted and heart felt continuation of the future of star wars. its what we need. its pushed the star wars world into a new place. rather the fan boys fall in and enjoy it like i did or not(im a big fan of star wars). Disney owns star wars this is their take on star wars its not you dads story. and i appreciate every bit of what they wanted to do.","true":true}
