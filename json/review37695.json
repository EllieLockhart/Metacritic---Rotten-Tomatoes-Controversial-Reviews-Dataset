Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There\u2019s parts I love with this movie such as Kylo\\, Rey\\, and Luke\u2019s scenes every single one of them and occasionally Leia as well. Then there\u2019s the other 50% of this movie that left me feeling Meh every single time I watch it. I hated how much attention was put in Finn and Rose on Canto Bight and Poe\\, Leia\\, and Holdo and their whole situation. I felt like these were great characters that needed something better to do but instead it was boring the whole time. Because of this I just can\u2019t ignore how much this movie is hard to watch without skipping a bunch of scenes.","true":true}
