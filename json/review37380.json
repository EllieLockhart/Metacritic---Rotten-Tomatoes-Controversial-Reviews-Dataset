Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem I found with the film was the lack of a real light saber fight scene and Luke's direction in the film. For old fan base who were kids when the first film came out this one is hard to swallow. Teased Luke in episode 7 to not using him smart in episode 8. Never mind that Snoke was a disaster!  Somehow the Disney powers that be lost the fan factor of what we wanted to see! Luke as a Jedi master fighting \\,Snoke's back story and his powers in a fight scene. Disney miss here is surprising and I can see why the fan scores are coming in low. They took some chances and made many changes which I commend but I think they blew it. Only Star Wars movie I ever went to see and left disappointed .","true":true}
