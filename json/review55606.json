Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing really great about this movie. Changing directors mid trilogy was definitely a mistake. The plot meanders through a middle hour and a half not really knowing what to do. If you like movies about literal stalled out cars this is for you. The storylines that are new arent anything that stellar either. The character Rose is probably the most compelling story and even her story becomes Disney in the galaxy too often. Plot lines started in The Force Awakens are either abandoned entirely or given the bare minimum development which is probably a mistake in well you know a sequel. Not sure where the critics are finding it praise worthy. A diverse cast is great\\, but when the script gives them nothing to work with it's still a dull movie. Here's hoping Rian Johnson doesn't helm any future Star Wars movies. Wasting Luke Skywalkers return is a crime against the franchise  up there with Jar Jar","true":true}
