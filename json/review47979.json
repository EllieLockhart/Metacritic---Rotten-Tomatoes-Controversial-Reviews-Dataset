Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it was enjoyable as a movie\\, it was not enjoyable as a Star Wars film-let alone another chapter in the main\/Skywalker Star Wars saga. The tone and pacing are off-too much comic book movie style humor\\, and anime inspired cinematography.\\n\\nThere characters had nothing at stake-nothing to lose that meant anything to the audience. What was the point of this story within the main saga?","true":true}
