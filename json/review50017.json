{"101487":200242,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yup. Just like Abrams didn't understand star wars fans this director and writer didn't understand what fans wanted either and I feel SOOO strongly about it I may just boycot the last film altogether. It sucked. I hated it. It was flippant\\, it ignored the last movie\\, it ignored any logical character development luke should have had as a jedi. He is like the star of the prior trilogy. duh. but noooooo lets make him a comic parody. Listen\\, there is a vast difference between playing off Yoda's first comic stint because the audience didn't know him yet\\, but when you have a character who's first action is to toss his light sabre into the wind and go WTF you completely alienate not only fans\\, but the entire nature of how intrinsicly important the force is to star wars. Its like saying you don't need the force\\, the single most important symbol of the jedi and you litterally toss it out. It is so monumentally stupid the writers need to be fired. disney needs to sell the rights to star wars BACK to lucas and strike the last two movies completely from this abhorent time line we have all shared to our sad misfortune.  IT is MONUMENTALLY stupid. its idiotic. its maddening and yet there is more. The writers couldn't stop there they had to ignore any virtue of character development and went instead with character undevelopment. The story suffers seriously from having a real villain. Ben is not a villian. Snokes was suppose to be the villian\\, that was set up in the force awakens\\, but oops. lets ignore what the last movie did\\, just like the movie ignored Rey's set up for a relationship with Luke\\, and just like it set up a relationship between Rey and Fin\\, oops\\, ignored. It even ignored the energy Fin and Poe Dameron had in the first movie\\, and made Fin an anti-hero AGAIN\\, without any thought to the fact that that was his role in the force awakens\\, but it forgot that  'oh\\, at least Abrams had the sense to redeem him in that movie' oh wait... oh.. wait.. this idiot fin had the same plot line!!!!!! only he had to have ROSE help show him there was a point in redemption. um. complete frikin retread of a plot mechanic. OMG What this film makes up in dissappointment it delivers in unimaginative plot\\, stolen from a movie that isn't even 3 years old yet. Then there is the Hoth retread. Yuck. Idiotic. Then there is the whole problem with Laura Dern delivering a 'resistance' monologue so politically dripping it convinced me I should have walked out when Luke threw out his light sabre. If this is what Disney is doing to Star Wars\\, I will just not be a fan anymore. Disney can go skrew itself without my money. \\n\\nI'd say may the force be with you\\, but I don't think it will help this 'unvisionary' crew since they threw out anything that had meaning to the starwars galaxy. No\\, Luke\\, no skywalker\\, no villains\\, just a whiney beotch with not an ounce of menace in him. oh\\, and oh\\, no fans.","true":true}
