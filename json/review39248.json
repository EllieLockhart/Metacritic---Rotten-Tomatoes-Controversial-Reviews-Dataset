Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had a lot of potential but unfortunately the writer seemed to be too concerned with creating boring plot twists and pointless sub-plots which took up way too much time. The affect of this is a movie with no character development\\, and no drama. A multitude of marvellous emotionless action sequences permeated with cringeworthy humour. Not to mention the fact that it completely undermines the other films that come before it.","true":true}
