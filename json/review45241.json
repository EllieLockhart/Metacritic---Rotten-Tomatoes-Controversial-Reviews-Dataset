Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Until this point I was reasonably happy with Disney's expanded universe\\, but after watching episode 8 I want a do-over!\\n\\nWas really looking forward to this film. Have always enjoyed Star Wars but wouldn't have considered myself a die-hard fan\\, however i have recently become quite invested in the franchise reading the comics\\, watching Star Wars Rebels and what-not. Unfortunately this movie was truly awful\\, and I *really* wanted to enjoy it. Hugely disappointed. I don't think I need to go into the specifics as it really ought to be obvious to anyone who watches the film\\, and has been covered in detail by others.","true":true}
