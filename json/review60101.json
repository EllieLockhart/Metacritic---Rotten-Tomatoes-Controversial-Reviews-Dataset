Gameplay wise the game is good. Though there is not much improvement from the last one. Story wise it's....bad. I don't dislike TLOU2's story because it's depressing. The first game was depressing yet still good.

The first game was depressing yet still good. I dislike it because it takes a big fat dump on pre-existing characters and tries to make me sympathize with most of the new **** characters. Only 3 of the new characters are actually sympathetic. The rest are a bunch of murdering hypocritical psychopaths. The story focuses on themes anyone with an ounce of sympathy or empathy knows. Revenge \u2260 equal justice and killing for anything other than survival is bad. It's completely pointless and only tries to make people feel **** and not try and convey anything of real substance.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
