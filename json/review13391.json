Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. The acting\\, especially between Finn and Rose was a little cheesy at points\\, and I could have really done without the giant walrus boobie milk\\, those are really my only complaints. I loved this movie. I don't know why so many people are coming on here and bashing it so bad. Star Wars fans must really hate Star Wars.","true":true}
