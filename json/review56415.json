Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The attempts at humor were obnoxious. The entire first half of the movie could have been skipped if the Vice Admiral had simply told people what her plan was- or even that she had a plan at all. Luke's character was assassinated. Leia flies in outer space. Snoke was killed with no explanation why he could exist in the first place as an old Dark Side user alive during the time Palpatine was turning or destroying all Force users. \\n\\n\\\"Rey from nowhere\\\" brings nothing to the saga which had previously been about the Skywalker family. The entire mythos of the story was thrown out and even mocked in the movie. \\n\\nI've been a life-long Star Wars fanatic\\, and after Last Jedi I have absolutely no interest in anything else Disney churns out.","true":true}
