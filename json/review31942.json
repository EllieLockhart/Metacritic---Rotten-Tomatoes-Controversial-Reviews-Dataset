{"101487":169342,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERISH*This is a poorly put together film which does something which i've never seen in a big budget film before\\, anything that is set up and is built up to the moment of truth\\, is explained away as...nothing and nothing exceptional happens\\, or completely undos great plots moments after they happen or are about to\\, and replace it with dire alternative narrative\\, in a gottya spaceballs kind of way..just bizarre and not shocking in a good way like 'I am your father!'?\\n if this was the original Rocky film it would be tantamount to someone else jumping in the ring and fighting after all the build up and chanting was for Rocky\\,for no reason\\, also cut any training\\, because (Not even being a Padwan) Rey\\, can do everything and more\\, with no guidance or learning what so ever. \\nthen there is the massive plot holes dis-guarded characters and also destroying the Mythos of SW that made it have purpose in the first place.\\nIt also has to be said The SWJ agenda is so forced and of a current political flavour that it continuously brought me out of the fantasy\\, not to mention some dreadful 'comedy'.  Now Star Wars has always had funny moments but they were born out of ridiculous but real situations..not gags per se. Han and Leia have a \\\"tiff'' before jumping in the compactor for example\\, when the galaxys future hangs in the balance and they're being hunted and shot at..that is incidentally funny and not distraction from the film. JJ Abrams managed to get this tone right with Finn\\, who was incidentally funny In TFA moments with Rey and Han being notable\\, but in this dull\\, disjointed\\, disappointing offering that is TLJ\\, he is merely given  watery slap stick humour not to mention his character arch is completely thrown away in this film and several pointless scenes\\, the worst being the casino...why?.\\nVisually it is stunning but with this kind of budget it should be\\, and even though I wasn't keen on the story it could have been made to work in a more competent directors hands\\, and the depth of Luke inner turmoil and redemption could have been given the gravitas it required to work\\, but this has taken movies on Jesus Christ (as this is what is harken to be) as the lead character\\, the entire length of the film to pay off in a manor that worked  but this was never going to happen with so many plots going on with the newbies\\, and it also seems like there is so much external interference going on with the film\\, at ever turn\\, it's the only explanation I can give for Rian J Being so off the mark and it being so dis-jointed. Directors direct\\, and Producers should Produce and know where the line is\\, unless you are someone like Spielberg who knows their stuff. \\nI had No issue with Leia having Jedi powers but it could and should have been awesome and in keeping with Jedi law\\, and maybe in an attempt to save Han and stop Ben\\, she summoned it up from her gut in an almighty way...after learning a few things watching Ben in training or something...anything but SPACE MARY POOPINS\\,but that would mean Leia and Luke having proper leading roles in these films which KK seems to have been wholly against\\, and I'm ignoring the lack or decompression chamber when she is let back in....because it wouldn't just suck everyone out would it?\\nIn conclusion\\, I now have zero interest in any of these characters or the story what so ever\\, I left the cinema feeling empty and void\\, I won't be going back for SW9 and certainly will not be having the legacy of Han Solo completely mishandled\\, badly acted and ruined by more SJW nonsense by watching SOLO\\, the film\\, literally NO ONE ASKED FOR!\\nI loved TFA \\,the similarity of previous films didn't annoy me as much as it did others and all the set ups by JJ where interesting and left me wanting more and Rogue One was a great film\\, with just a little SJW edging in but not enough to kill the film like this one did.\\nI have no idea why there was a need to be so ageist and kill off all the older characters asap. we could have easily seen this trilogy be set a little earlier and made all about Luke\\, Leia and Han\\, and watching Ben lose his way and the new characters Rey\\,Finn(what a waste of character set up)Poe\\,Maz(what a silly cameo from someone who was awesome TFA)\\, Snoke(WHO?) slowly being interwoven into this trilogy to then have the next trilogy be mostly if not wholly\\, about them.\\n\\nNote:Mark Hamill is absolutely Fantastic in this film especially seeing what material he had to work with\\, and without a doubt the best Acted out of all the other players \\, shame however  it didn't really feel like I was watching Luke Skywalker or was enough to save this travesty. I'll end on one more point: PURPLE HAIR.#justiceforakbah","true":true}
