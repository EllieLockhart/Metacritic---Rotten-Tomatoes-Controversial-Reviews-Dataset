Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the Star Wars movie we deserve. I was thrilled by The Force Awakens\\, by the new characters and the return of the old\\, but the storyline itself was boring. It felt like the Death Star was getting its third\\, stale outing and old characters had barely changed since we saw them last in Return of the Jedi. It was made by a fan too much in awe of his material. His love for the originals shone through\\, but it was an homage to The Empire Strikes Back rather than a fresh chapter where time has passed and characters have changed. In the end\\, it didn't matter too much\\, TFA was beautiful and I was won over from the second those yellow letters started to crawl up the screen. \\n\\nSo now to Rian Johnson's attempt at a Star Wars movie. There are so many reasons it is a success to me. Setting aside the new worlds\\, the new creatures (Porgs! Glitter critters!! Racegoatlynxes!!!) and the refreshing swathe of new characters played by women and people of colour (finally)\\, at the core of this movie is it's attention to failure. Things go wrong. Characters mess up. Bad choices are made. Trust is betrayed\\, heroes disappoint\\, legends turn out to be an illusion. Things don't go the way you think. And yet there is hope. I am so glad that this hope doesn't stem from the Skywalker dynasty\\, that the message is that ordinary people\\, a rejected girl\\, the children of nobodies\\, can resist and lead and bring down empires. \\n\\nIn having his characters literally burn and destroy all that is familiar\\, Johnson destroys the safe\\, formulaic\\, Star Wars-by-numbers that JJ Abrams so lovingly created. The old ways are dead. What will become of this growing force between Rey & Kylo Ren? With The Last Jedi\\, Johnson has stripped away cliche and predictability. I have no idea what will happen in Episode IX. I am all the happier for that.","true":true}
