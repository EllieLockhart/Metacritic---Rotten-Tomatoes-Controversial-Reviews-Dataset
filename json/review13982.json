Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you hate this movie\\, that's fine. You're entitled to your opinion. But from my perspective\\, I don't get the hate for this film. Especially considering the reason people hated Force Awakens was because it was too similar\\, now this film is too different? Anyway...This film is absolutely amazing. This is the most unique Star Wars film of all time. It makes the Star Wars universe feel different in a way that the prequels didn't do that well (and that's coming from someone who does fairly enjoy the prequels). Amazing acting\\, amazing action\\, unexpected twists\\, great score\\, and overall a fun time. As far as flaws\\, I'm conflicted by the way Snoke was used AND the side plot involving Finn & Rose could've been cut down a little. OVERALL GRADE = A","true":true}
