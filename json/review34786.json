Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director of this mind-blowin movie has done an excellent job\\, as this was his first Star Wars movie that he has directed. This movie has absolutely brilliant visual effects and the acting was amazing. The plot was awesome and it kept me on the edge of my seat even at 12 in the morning. This is definitely a must watch.","true":true}
