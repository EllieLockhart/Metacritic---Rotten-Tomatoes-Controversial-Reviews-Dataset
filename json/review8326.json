Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fell flat for me when they removed the Finn storyline and added in that grossly inappropriate relationship of Kylo Ren and Rey. Shame on you guys for ruining a perfectly good story\/plot. ","true":true}
