Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie alone is good\\, but for those like me\\, who loves the star wars universe and the lore of the franchise is a kick in the balls. the movie is full whit plot holes and whit a humor that many times is so bad\\, it feels like a different movie\\, but not a star wars movie\\, and what they did to Luke in this movie is just so so bad.","true":true}
