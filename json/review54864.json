Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a fabulous film.  If you are threatened by well written female characters who have agency\\, it might not be the film for you.\\n\\nFor nonmisogynists\\, The Last Jedi is a great piece of story telling.  It's not just cashing in on nostalgia.  The conflicts in the film are nuanced.","true":true}
