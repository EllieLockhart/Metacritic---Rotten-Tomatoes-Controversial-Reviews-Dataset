Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Other than great cinematography and decent space battles\\, there is not much I like about the movie.  It doesn't address any question we had from the Force Awakens and we still don't know who Snoke is. The plot is also very chaotic and can be hard to follow at times because you are trying to follow 4-5 stories at once.\\n\\nSummary:\\n- Chaotic plot\\n- Doesn't answer any questions\\n- Luke does not seem like \\\"Luke\\\"\\n- Weaponizing hyper speed\\n- The Marry Poppins moment...\\n- Why didn't they just tell Poe the plans? Why didn't the First Order corner them?\\n- Some unneeded humor at times (feels more like a Marvel movie than Star Wars)\\n- I don't care about half of the new characters and the characters I was interested in were either killed with no backstory or had no questions answered","true":true}
