Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Should be renamed the last Star Wars after this disaster.  Beside all the political theories and murdering of fan based plot this movie just does not meet expectation of hype and what we expect from a franchise.  Plot holes\\, bad writing\\, side stories that go no where\\, unexploited main story characters that just suddenly go away with out proper character development or developed story line in general.  Don't bother seeing unless you want to watch your childhood and a story die a slow death and then a funeral.  Have the other 7 on blue ray.  Not bothering to add this one.","true":true}
