Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film you need to see twice. First time get to know the plot and storyline. Second time ignore the story and focus on the characters\\, in particular Luke\\, Ray and Ben Solo. I was so much more engaged with them a second time around and genuinely felt closer to Luke by the end. The humour is great\\, ending fantastic and some good twists in the middle.i am a long time fan and at the end of the day I don't care who Snoke is\\, this saga has always been about family and one family in particular. Will watch again for sure","true":true}
