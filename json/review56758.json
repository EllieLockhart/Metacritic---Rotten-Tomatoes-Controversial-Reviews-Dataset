Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was full of cheesy moments\\, and overall did not feel like a Star Wars movie for significant portions of the runtime. Rey and Finn felt like they were always taking a backseat to Luke\\, and many subplots felt unnecessary and forced to add more to the main plot. In the end\\, the characters that the Force Awakens excellently sets up feel like throwaway characters.\\n\\nAlso\\, the new characters introduced in this movie really do not add much to the trilogy and feel boring.","true":true}
