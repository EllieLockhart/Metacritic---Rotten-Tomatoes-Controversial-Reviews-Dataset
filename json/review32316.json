Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars has been officially disney-fied.  Which is a bad thing.  The plot closely resembles a \\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\\" movie.  Which is another way of saying \\\"it's just a bunch of stuff that happens\\\" or \\\"switch your brain off and get ready to be entertained\\\".  Also sad to see a star wars movie mocking the jedi religion.  How can star wars ever be taken seriously after this?","true":true}
