Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst StarWars movies I've ever seen.\\nFull if idiotic plot holes\\, characters doing unexplained things\\, no major story line to follow - in fact they went above and beyond to destroy any possible plot line only to make sure we get they are so woke and progressive.\\nProblem is\\, they pretty much broke every rule in the Star Wars universe in this movie so I totally lost interest in this entire franchise after this.\\n\\nAnd no\\, I don't have a problem with the female cast - I actually liked \\\"the force awakens\\\" and had high hopes for this one only to be hugely disappointed.\\n\\nBy the way - I used \\\"TomatoCalc\\\" to get all reviews and calculate the real audience score... its says 45% on the site\\, but only 12% of reviews are 3.5 stars or above.\\n\\nSo its actually more like audience score of 12%... not sure why rotten tomato is messing with the audience score nubmers...","true":true}
