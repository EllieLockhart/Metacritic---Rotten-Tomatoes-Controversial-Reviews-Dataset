Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is everything you wouldn't\\n expect. It's not trying to cater to the fans and instead is a artistic vision the writers have. Give the movie time\\, give it time to be appreciated for its genius. Rey's parents emphasized the force in the BEST way possible\\, instead of being from lineage. Snoke was there for KYLO\\, and this is why he was treated as such. This movie is obviously without its problems\\, such as the pacing and the Finn\/Rose subplot\\, but every movie\\, a STAR WARS movie\\, in particular\\, isn't without said problems or others issues. People didn't like the Empire Strikes Back was HATED when it first came out and look at it now. Above all else it's a movie\\, I get that\\, and you can criticize it as such. But when you are calling someone an idiot for liking something that is entirely subjective\\, you're the idiot. I see TLJ as a movie that did things differently\\, and didn't cater to what you expected. I respect it for that. Down the line it will be appreciated once the shock wears off. This is about Rey and Kylo Ren. This movie is something that should be appreciated for its daring and risky moves. While the jokes are a miss 99% of the time\\, once it gets going it REALLY gets going. One of the best fighting scenes in the saga. I don't love this film\\, but I like it\\, I respect it.","true":true}
