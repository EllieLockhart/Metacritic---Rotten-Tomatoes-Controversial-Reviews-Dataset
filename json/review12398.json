Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I booked ticket for the premier\\, I couldn't be more disappointed. What a terrible Star Wars film\\, all the plot lines set up by J.J. Abrams in the first film are destroyed simply to give Rian Johnson the chance to put his stamp on the saga. What Disney don't realise is that J.J. stayed faithful to the canon\\, and this was why TFA\\, was such a success. I won't be purchasing tickets to anymore premiers and if Disney don't pick up on fans disappointment with this Marvel\/teen Hollywood drama hybrid then they will certainly pay for it in the box office. Get J.J. Abrams back!","true":true}
