Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"definitely would not interested in seeing this movie for a 2nd time.. you know it's bad when you hear people at a 1215pm start time snoring!! movie was so predictable and at the same time made little sense.
