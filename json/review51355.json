Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute mess of a movie - absurd plot\\, shallow characters. Completely absurd\\, out of place humour. The character of Luke Skywalker has been reduced to a nephew-murdering\\, psychic hermit who performs slap-stick comedy. This movie leaves little to resolve for the final instalment in the Skywalker saga - Snoke\\, Han\\, Luke are dead; Rey is inexplicably powerful whilst Kyle Ren is feeble at best. The Resistance is small\\, yet the expansive First Order are run by dotards with space ships that conveniently can't keep-up nor destroy particular rebel ships. Leia is now Mary Poppins and able to fly through space. BB-8 is now able to shoot an endless amount of casino chips from a few orifices\\, and Captain Phasma falls down a hole (a very weak attempt parallel to Boba Fett). Disney has officially ran-sacked one of the most beloved franchises in  cinema - going as far as placing annoying space penguins in the movie in a transparent attempt to move merchandise. The dark side is strong with this one.","true":true}
