Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I went into this movie excited for the movie to pick-up from the Force Awakens due to my absolute love of Star Wars. The critics and early reviews sure had me fooled. The movie was absolute garbage. The storyline had to have been thought up by a 5 year old\\, the character development was not present and this thing had more CGI than Attack of the Clones. I hated it. This movie was the worst thing since gravity in space and  hyperspace used as a weapon.","true":true}
