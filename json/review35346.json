Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Irish Island of Skellig Michael where Luke Skywalker is hiding out is a starkly beautiful place. But the scenes there of him agonizing over whether to help the Resistance go on far too long. About 35 minutes should have been edited out of this film. Far too many scenes drag on and on. Far to many subplots end with a whimper.... I don't understand how so many talented writers and editors could have produced this slow moving film....","true":true}
