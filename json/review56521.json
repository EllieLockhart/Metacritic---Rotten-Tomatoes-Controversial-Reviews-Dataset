Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor didn't always land\\, and Canto Bight may be the most poorly executed plotline since the prequels\\, but when The Last Jedi hits\\, it hits hard. I adore this movie. Cut this movie 15 minutes shorter and it would be a 5 star film. As it sits now; 4 stars. Can't wait to see it again","true":true}
