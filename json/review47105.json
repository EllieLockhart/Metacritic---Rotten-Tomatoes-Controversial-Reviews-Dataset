Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a huge\\, giant turd of a (movie)\\, that is if you even dare call that a movie and not a political statement and pure sexism. I'm a female\\, have been a Star Wars fan for a LONG time and I can tell you now\\, it is dead. They destroyed Luke Skywalker\\, they destroyed Snoke\\, they... Destroyed every male character actually (except for Fin\\, he stays a coward and useless as always ! Leia is now Superman\\, Luke now uses powers maybe Dr. Strange (might) be able to do\\, feminist Mary Sue is now more powerful than Palpatine ever was considering he was limited because he was a bad\\, evil\\, white male...  Bogus\\, irrelevant Chinese chick comes in and somehow falls in love with the most useless character around in a new record for amount of time taken. The plot holes\\, (should we even dare call them holes at this point?)\\, when the (holes are bigger than Jupiter\\, I don't call them (holes) anymore; those are more numerous than actual living beings in the entire Galaxy.. Yes there is action\\, yes the CGI is great and I guess that's all that counts for the level of I.Q in people today....  If you are a Star Wars fan\\, stay far\\, FAR away from this turd ! If you are a not too brilliant drone of a person that likes shiny things\\, lots of pew pews\\, Mary Sue (s)\\, anti male\\, corny\\, out of nowhere\\, out of place jokes and humor\\, this (movie) is for you !  Did I mention they actually find a way to screw up even Yoda too ? When Ewoks and Jar Jar make their movies look like the kind of movie that would get 100 Oscars\\, there's a problem ! Keep Politics and B.S political correctness and such garbage out of movies and sagas please\\, but\\, even more important\\, keep your mind boggingly obvious sexism out of movies as well\\, especially Star Wars.... Actually nvm\\, you just destroyed that and admit it\\, it was your intention all along and now you are all excited about it ! 0.5\/5 for me ! BOOOOOO Disney ! BOOOOO Lucasfilm\\, plz fire that sexist ... you have as director called Kat... Ken... I won't name her\\, she who shall not be named ! All in All in all I give this turd a half star rating\\, it's more than generous !","true":true}
