Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"FUCKING TRASH. DIRECTOR & PRODUCER SHOULD GET THE FUCK OUT. FUCKING RUINED EVERYTHING AND ALTERED ALL THE CHARACTERS IN A COMPLETELY UNFASHIONABLE MANNER. CAN'T WRITE WORTH SHIT. ENTIRE FILM IS A FUCKING SHITSTORM. CAN ONLY HOPE TO GOD JJ ABRAMS CAN RECOVER EPISODE 9 FROM THIS COMPLETE FUCKUP.","true":true}
