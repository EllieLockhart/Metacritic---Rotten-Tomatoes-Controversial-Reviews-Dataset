{"101487":175757,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a good movie overall\\, but there were things that dissapointed me. WARNING SPOLIERS AHEAD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI wanted to see more of Snoke. He was the character I wanted to know the most out of everyone else. Now that he is dead\\, I am disappointed. This man seemed so evil and I assumed he was the most evil person in the universe\\, even more evil than Palestine. There was so much we could've learned about him.\\n\\nI am upset about the \\\"death\\\" of Phasma. If she truly is dead\\, she was one heck of a waste. In TFA\\, that was one thing that bothered me. Phasma barely did anything\\, so I was hoping that she would do more here. She did nothing. She maybe had 5 minutes MAX of screen time. She barely had any lines. That disappointed me a lot.\\n\\nI wanted Luke to do more. He seemed like this all powerful being. He did'nt do much at all. Just complain and grumble. The coolest thing he did was use that force illusion. Right after that he DIES. I would've liked to see him go ACTUALLY FIGHTING  KYLO REN. \\n\\nThere are a lot of other things that bothered me\\, like the Finn and Rose subplot and Rey's parents being \\\"nobodies\\\". But that will make this review longer. (This is my first review btw)\\n\\nOther than that\\, he Movie is pretty good.","true":true}
