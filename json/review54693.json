Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. Even though there were a few plot holes and unrealistic aspects\\, I hardly even noticed them because I was so immersed in the story. The comic relief kept the movie from getting too heavy\\, and the fight scenes were really cool as well. The characters were great and I left the theater with a giant grin on my face. I recommend it. Watch it for yourself and form an opinion. Some like it\\, and some just don't.","true":true}
