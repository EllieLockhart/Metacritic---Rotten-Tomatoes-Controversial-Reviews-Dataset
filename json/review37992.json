Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The special effects are the only thing that made this movie from being utterly terrible.  Too many plot holes\\,  Too many characters that you don't care about.  I don't think Disney and the director and maybe JJ Abrams get the gist of the original Star Wars Trilogy.   Despite the amazing special effects for the time there was a human element full of emotion and conflict that we are go through in life.  This was just bad theater.","true":true}
