Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Eventhough it might not be the film in terms of plot. The thematic weight definitely makes up for it in my opinion it challenges the traditional themes of star wars films. This film was a risk and looking at the reception it's success is debatable but I thought it was worth it.","true":true}
