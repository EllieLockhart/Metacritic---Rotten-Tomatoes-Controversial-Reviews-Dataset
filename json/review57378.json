Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruins not just the 3rd trilogy but the entire Skywalker saga itself. Poor plot\\, terrible direction with the characters and makes up new \\\"rules\\\" that dont make any sense in the context of the rest of the movies. The only reason I gave 1 star is for the visually stunning scenery and effects.","true":true}
