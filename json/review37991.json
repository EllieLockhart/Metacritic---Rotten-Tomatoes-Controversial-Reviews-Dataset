Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The special effects are ok\\, but overall it's a very bad written movie\\, it destroys the storyline of VII\\, it disrespects the characters of the original trilogy and it really goes nowhere... This movie is so destructive to the Star Wars saga that it may very well have killed it... \\nIt would be a very brave and necessary move for Disney to re-do this movie\\, to save any enthusiasm for this legendary saga.","true":true}
