Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies I watched in a long time. I've never enjoyed myself so much while watching a 2-hour film. While it did have some plot holes\\, it definitely deserves a lot more than 52%. I highly encourage people to watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi. You won't regret it!","true":true}
