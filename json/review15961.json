Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to give an honest review\\, unlike many people here who just rate it high for being a Star Wars movie. Without spoiling\\, I would just like to say\\, the movie had lazy writing\\, unnecessary finn and rose extended section and disregard for previous movie characters\\, even Star Wars: The Force Awaken (you will understand after viewing the movie. Don't ruin your day by holding this movie to a high regard when preparing to watch the movie and enter with low expectations.","true":true}
