Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is clear to me that Disney does not understand Star Wars. This was a horrible movie that refused to answer any outstanding questions. Moreover\\, the character Assassination on Luke Skywalker is stupid. I can only assume that Disney is buying the reviews of movie critics. ","true":true}
