Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly disappointed. The humor was cheap and completely incongruous with Star Wars. The dialogue was completely out of step with the characters. Poe's character was completely neutered. The whole Finn storyline was a complete waste of screen time\\, as it added nothing to the main plot - he could have never left the main fleet and the end result to the story would be completely unaffected. Like deserved such a better storyline and character arc - they diminished him to nothing essentially. And that ending... these professional critics are smoking some strong stuff with their rave reviews\\, because this movie was a nightmare.","true":true}
