Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi failed to capture the beloved feeling of a Star Wars movie. Humor was used in the most inappropriate places. The story was all over the place. The characters didn't really develop. It was obvious the director changed between episodess 7 and 8 as the characters and dialogue did not flow between the two movies. This film was the epitome of my fears when I learned Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Good luck to JJ Abrams saving the new trilogy with episode 9\\, because Rian Johnson burned everything we loved about episode 7 and the Star Wars franchise to the ground and didn't leave much to save. Worst Star Wars film hands down\\, and calling this film disappointing would be the understatement of the century.","true":true}
