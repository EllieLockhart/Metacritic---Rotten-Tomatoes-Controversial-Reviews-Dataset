Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This mess of Social Justice preachiness is a poor caricature of a Star Wars movie\\, and betrays the spirit of the original saga in many ways. It's the movie that made me not want to see any more Star Wars movies\\, and my love for the original saga makes me want to forget this one.","true":true}
