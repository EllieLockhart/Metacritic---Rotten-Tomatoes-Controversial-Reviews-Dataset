Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so disappointed in this movie. It seemed so cheesy. Luke had zero humor in previous trilogy and now is the funny guy? There was hardly anything to the story. I love Star Wars and this one nearly put me to sleep. I don\u2019t understand the critics calling it fresh. In comparison to the Force awakens when we learn of Rey and also Rogue One\\, this one was just bad.","true":true}
