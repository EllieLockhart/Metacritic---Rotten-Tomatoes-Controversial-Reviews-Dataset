Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was amazing. I got bored of Kyle. Rey was pretty good. Finn was better. Rose was the breakout. Hux was reduced to Disney\/Marvel jokes. Still didn't really care about Captain Phasma. The porgs....... were better than expected. The stylistic themes of this movie were fantastic at times\\, but boy did the story drag on.","true":true}
