Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! I don't understand the hate behind this film. Simple and easy to follow plot\\, new fun characters and further developed existing ones. Not everything landed but no film is perfect and I understand the reasoning behind some of the decisions made. Furthered the mythos\\, call backs to prequels in an interesting way. Interesting take on Luke which I was a fan of. So many directions Ep.9 can go in and I can't wait to see where they take it next.","true":true}
