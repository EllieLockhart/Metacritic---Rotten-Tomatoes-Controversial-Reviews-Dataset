Its cliche like that but it knows it and doesnt try to be something else. As far as a horror story\\, it flowed seamlesly and didnt jump at irregular intervals as the story developed\\, which can be the case for alot of horror type games\/movies.\r\rOverall\\, it was one of those games that kept me wanting to play. Any game that does that is a success in my books. Its obvious that a lot of effort went into this game\\, the attention to details in some spots is just applaudable.\r\rI give it an 8 because of some stiff movement\\, a few holes in the story (bound to happen anyway)\\, and there can be some room for improvement in terms of character development.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
