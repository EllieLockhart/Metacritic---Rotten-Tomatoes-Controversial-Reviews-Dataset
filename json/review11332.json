Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrendous movie that spits on every fan's face. This smart director\\, who thinks he's so smart\\, has managed to destroy a whole universe in a single movie. Well done\\, sir\\, well done. Way stronger than a death star. \\nSo what's the point of this trilogy anyway? Movie 7 was copy-pasted from movie 4. Movie 8 just destroys everything. So\\, what has this trilogy (with already 2 films out of 3) accomplished so far? The political context is nowhere. Hell\\, we've got to a situation even worse than at the begining of movie 4! So what was the point of the whole original trilogy?\\nWell done guys\\, truly\\, well done. You've lost a star wars fan forever. No way I'm gonna see movie 9. No way i'm gonna give a penny to the star wars franchise anymore. I hope you guys are proud of yourselves.","true":true}
