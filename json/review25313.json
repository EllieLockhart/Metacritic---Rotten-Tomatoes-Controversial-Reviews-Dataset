Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No I am not a \\\"die hard\\\" fan as others would like people to believe.... This was just a flat out terrible movie... Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself... This is not about changing the story or going into another direction.. This is just garbage story telling with no regard of characters or lore created either within this trilogy or the first 6 movies... The entire movies plot literally ends up how it starts and its completely pointless... You will leave the movie stunned and confused with more questions that will never be answered","true":true}
