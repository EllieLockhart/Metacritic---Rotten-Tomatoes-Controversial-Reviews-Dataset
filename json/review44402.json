Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many twists and turns while trying to focus on too many characters. A lot to be desired from the story lines of new characters created in the 7th movie that were also in the 8th.","true":true}
