Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had only seen one star wars movie (when I was a kid) and I didn't remember much of it\\, so i went into this movie not knowing a bunch. Honestly\\, even without seeing most of the other movies\\, this held my attention. It had some great scenes and I was never bored. It moved along at a good pace . I'd recommend it.","true":true}
