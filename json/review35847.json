Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi might as well have been named The Last Star Wars Movie\\, because it completely destroyed any continuity with previous movies\\, and goes against what has previously been established by being indecisive and just plain dumb in its rather simplistic story.","true":true}
