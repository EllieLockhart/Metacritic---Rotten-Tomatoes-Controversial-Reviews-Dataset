Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been reading through the criticisms of \\\"The Last Jedi' and I must say that I agree with a lot of the opinions. There are way too many plot inconsistencies and ham-fisted attempts at social commentary in this film for it to actually be entertaining. I found myself so distracted by the forced representation of current political issues that it completely failed to teleport me to a \\\"long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away....\\\"\\n\\nFor me\\, the absolute deal-breaker comes when ghost Yoda burns the ancient Jedi texts\\, citing that they're not page-turners and that Rey has all of the knowledge that she needs without them. If we remove the thin veil from this metaphor and apply it to our own world\\, you'll see that Master Yoda is really burning the Holy Bible and claiming that it is not necessary. I can't be a fan of this franchise any longer.","true":true}
