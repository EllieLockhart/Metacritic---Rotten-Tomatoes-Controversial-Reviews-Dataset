Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was curious to see the new Star Wars movie. It is a longer and worse re-telling of  episodes V and VI\\, with hardly any new ideas. They limited themselves to the same previous stories re-written for this cast (Yoda now Luke Skywalker; young Luke now Rey; etc etc). A shame. Maybe they should let their screenwriters use their imagination rather than confining them to the previous stories. \\nNot looking forward to the next movie at this rate. Also\\, not trusting the critics' score on this one either - a lot of my friends didn't like it...so we're more in the audience score range than in the critics' one.","true":true}
