Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some cool visuals\/concepts\\, but terrible pacing\\, bloated script writing\\, bland side characters\\, and cringey ill timed comedy. It actively avoids adding anything worthwhile or interesting to the Star Wars mythology\\, while also ruining the mythology established by the original trilogy.","true":true}
