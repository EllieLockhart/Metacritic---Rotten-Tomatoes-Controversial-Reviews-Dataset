Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not Star Wars\\, but instead felt like a marketing ploy to kids.  I feel like the only reason whh original heroes from OT were there wasn't to lure in the Star Wars fan base to make a quick buck out of them.  This is not just disrespectful to Star Wars.  In the words of Rian Johnson:  \\\"...this will be a lucrative Christmas\\\"","true":true}
