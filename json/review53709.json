Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"garbage. horrible writing\\, many plot holes and dead ends. ruined characters and pointless characters. lots of unneeded filler. no big lightsaber duel. honestly there's  too much wrong with this movie to list it all. this cinematic miscarriage was clearly not written by a fan\\, nor was it written for the fans. this was just a money grab. \\\"come see some explosions and plasma swords kids!\\\" i should have trusted my instincts that this was going to be awful\\, they were even too lazy to come up with an original title to the movie. \\\"the last jedi\\\" was already a book about a jedi named Jax Pavan. besides yoda\\, and obi wan he was the last surviving jedi of oder 66. a terrifically written novel by Michael Reaves and Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff. i recommend it to anyone and everyone. i suppose it's convenient since Disney bought lucas arts they declared the expanded universe non canon. so i guess technically that gives them full license to be lazy and destroy everything great about star wars. if you are a fan of star wars. don't watch this. \\\" only pain will you find.\\\"  thanks for completely destroying one of the greatest franchises ever created Disney. i won't be watching episode 9. star wars is dead to me.","true":true}
