Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, just awful! So much wrong with this film How did this ever get past the 'powers that be'? Proof that there is nothing but \\\"yes\\\" men\/women working under Kennedy\/Rian! \\nI truly wish I had not seen this movie. Star Wars is now a dead franchise for me. I have zero interest in seeing Episode 9. Solo is obviously going to be a mess and I won't support Disney\/Kennedy\/Johnson with any more of my money\\, so I'll wait for the red box of that.","true":true}
