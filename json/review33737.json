Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Not the Star Wars we all knew & loved. Disney need to pay George 40 times what they paid to stop this Titanic from sinking any further.\\n star just to get it on system.","true":true}
