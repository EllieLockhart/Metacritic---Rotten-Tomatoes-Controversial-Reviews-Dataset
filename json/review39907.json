Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars film to date. Falling far behind all of the prequel films. The plot is weak and character development is poor. The movie itself almost felt like it was a Star Wars spoof more than an authentic part of the series. A tremendous disappointment to true Star Wars fans. ","true":true}
