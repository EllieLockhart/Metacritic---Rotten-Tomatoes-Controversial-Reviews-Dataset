Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"91 % ????It seems that the Critics must  be paid by Disney.\\, .. it honors the Saga?  TLJ ..destroys the Saga ...  as a  lifetime Fan of SW\\,  my Heart is bleeding about this Movie  ... it sucks. ...I will say it Methaphoric - The Force is Weak in this Movie.. bad Story\\, weak Characters \\,the Fighting Scenes are really bad ... not even some cool 3D Effects ... only Luke has two Cool Scenes","true":true}
