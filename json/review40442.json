Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the death nail of the franchise.\\n\\nTo all Social justice warrior's out there giving this abomination 5 stars shame on you\\, how can you ruin yet another franchise? You have no soul's your movement is just a malignant cancer that infested everything with your social justice retoric. You have killed yet another one the saddest thing is you don't understand that your shoe horning diversity into everything and it has made this film unparalleled in rabid shilling\\, even the bad guys had so much diversity which is rather odd for a space Nazis to hire Asian\\, Hispanics and blacks and every commander in the film is pretty much a woman.\\n\\nBest propaganda of the year.
