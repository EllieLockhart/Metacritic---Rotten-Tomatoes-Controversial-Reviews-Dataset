Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I though that Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a fantastic film. I understand the a large amount of people are split on this film. Overall I found this movie extremely entertaining\\, and it had beautiful visuals\\, and interesting characters. While I do understand that many Star Wars fans didn't receive the film they were hoping for\\, I don't think that this movie deserved the strong negative reviews that it received. On IMDb\\, several thousand people gave the movie a 1\/10. I've seen movie that in my eyes were absolutely horrible compared to this movie and I still wouldn't give them a 1\/10. This was a high quality film that didn't live up to the hopes of many people. \\n\\nI understand that people had two major hopes for this film. To see more of Snoke's character\\, and to learn more about him and to see Luke Skywalker act as a jedi once again. While Snoke was killed off\\, I did see a bit of his character\\, and I do think that his character was ended for a reason (perhaps to focus on Kylo taking on the role of supreme leader). I was also very happy with what I saw with Luke's character. I once again got to see him after waiting all this time\\, and he was pretty good. \\n\\nOverall\\, I was very happy with this movie and it is definitely one of my favorite moviea of the year. I saw Snoke on the flesh\\, I saw Luke once again retun to his role as a jedi\\, and I witnessed the struggle between Rey and Kylo. This movie was beautifully shot\\, with great location. As usual the score for this film was also amazing\\, as it is with most Star Wars movies. Overall this is one of my favorite Star Wars films.","true":true}
