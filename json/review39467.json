Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film plays on old nostalgic moments from the original trilogy while making its own originality. The fact that all our fan theories didn't turn out what we theorized.... Is a great thing! They did their job. They were creative and original. It caught you off guard? Got you a little upset? Good. The movie did its job and got a reaction out of you. That's what those moments where filmed for. People are so easily dissatisfied these days and I'm looking mainly at the complaining annoying fans. I'm a HUGE star wars fan myself. Infact I hated it when Disney shut down the original expanded universe.... But you know what.... I love star wars and a good star wars movie is a good star wars movie. Stop the hating.","true":true}
