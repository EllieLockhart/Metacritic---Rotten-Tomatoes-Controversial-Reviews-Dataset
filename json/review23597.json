Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love it\\, had me no the edge of my seat most of the movie. was a few bit that were slow and some pointless bits that didn't fit with the Star wars ethos but over all it was good solid movie that was visually beautiful.","true":true}
