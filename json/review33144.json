Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointment.  I think many fans who watched and idolized Luke Skywalker when they were children will be repulsed by the weak\\, pointless ending of their childhood hero.  \\n\\nHere's another comparison.  Watching Han Solo get killed by his son in TFA was one of the most intense emotional scenes I've witnessed in Star Wars.  It was terrible and great at the same time.  It was absolutely necessary in the story and fit perfectly.  \\n\\nWhen Luke dies and just evaporates staring at the sun I feel nothing.  Its almost like the writer wanted to give a big FU to anyone who actually cared about this character.\\n\\nSo many other little annoyances but the Luke ending is the most obscene.","true":true}
