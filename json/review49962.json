Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You may argue that this film isn't great\\, or even good\\, and that there are superfluous bits that make the film drag. I loved it immensely. I enjoyed the whole thing from start to finish\\, including Finn's arc. It brought the mysticism back to the Force\\, and talked about failure and human brokenness in a surprisingly visceral way for a Star Wars film. Definitely worth watching. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!","true":true}
