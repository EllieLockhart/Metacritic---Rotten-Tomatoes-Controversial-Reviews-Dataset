Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have loved star wars since i was a little boy long before it became as mainstream as its beginning to be nowadays. I own so much merchandise including a full set of stormtrooper armour and a number of helmets. Im a lover of the movies\\, i grew up on the prequel trilogy as that was my teen years and i loved them but there were a few issues with them as all movies. All the movies coming from disney though are crap so far\\, absolute rubish and they are tarnishing the star wars name (with the exception of rogue one\\, i liked as they built up a good mix of characters but unfortunately i knew they were all going to die off). The force awakens was very poor and they killed off the legendary solo in such a stupid way\\, the villain annoys me every time he is on screen\\, im pretty sure i could knock this villain out myself with one right hook hes such a cry baby its drives me insane trying to understand why people like him?? Compared to Darth Vader hes an absolute wimp and it harms the movies drastically.\\n\\nNow the last jedi wow\\, i saw the trailers and i thought this looks like it might be the one to chnage my mind\\, it looked great and had the return of a legendary film icon and a childhood hero for me Luke skywalker. I was not ready... i have never been so annoyed at the end of a movie it was absolute garbage\\, they turned luke skywalker into a wimp and a man who would murder his own relatives\\, completely against the character and unbelievable. There was rubbish and almost sick enducing attempts at humour rammed in\\, the characters are boring\\, they are ramming political crap into a movie no end\\, its badly written\\, directed and an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has seen the originals. Just a joke i actually wanted my money back utter crap! As a result of this i didnt want to watch solo\\, a movie i was never exited about either and i most certainly will not be paying to see the next one im done..... dont watch this movie watch the originals or prequels or just something else..\\n\\nHowever its only quality was it looked the part and has perfect special effects\\, but that doesnt make a movie.... keep making the merchandise disney as you are churning out some good stuff to buy. But i wont pay another penny to see a star wars movie again. I could easilly make a better star wars movie the fans would love over this rubbish they continue to churn out.","true":true}
