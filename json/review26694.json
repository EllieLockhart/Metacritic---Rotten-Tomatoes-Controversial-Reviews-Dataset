Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK........\\n\\nTake out the -useless- subplot with Finn and Rose (even after the second time viewing I still have no idea what this subplot was ment to do)\\, add Jedi-training and an at least minimal plausible ending for Snoke (make a subplot with his Backstory?! PLS)\\n\\nIgnore the -nice to view but yeah well \\\"scratch your head\\\" (they DO have Torpedos in the Star wars Galaxy I'm certain about that)- suicide bomber run at the begining.\\n\\nDon't think to much about Luke's end (seriously DON'T).\\n\\nAnd we have a decent Star Wars (by no means a great one like prommised but I could live with that)\\n\\nDisney never ever again let Rian Johnson anywhere near Star Wars everyone else but not him.","true":true}
