Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie broke my heart\\, and I created this RT account because I needed to say so. I am not a bot nor am I alt-right. I am what many would call a SJW\\, and am proud of my feminism and my liberalism. All that said\\, this movie broke my heart because as with The Force Awakens and Han Solo\\, it denegrated and destroyed another one of my fictional heroes. It was gratuitous\\, disrespectful and cruel to dispose of an icon the way this movie did\\, especially in a time when we need our heroes and hope more than ever. I don't know why I would ever see the next installment in this trilogy knowing they will do the same to our Leia. I don't mind passing the baton\\, just don't trash the past to do so. It is wholly unnecessary and I'm very sad to report\\, has alienated this longtime fan.","true":true}
