Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing is an understatement. After the previous 2 Disney instalments\\, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed\\, I had high hopes for the last Jedi. I wish I hadn\u2019t bothered. I am not a Star Wars fanboy but am a big fan of the original series. The plot was littered with holes. Characters\\, which were previously loved\\, became annoying. The pointless Rose\/Finn sub plot should have been cut. kylo Ren was reduced to an angsty teenager. Most of the dialogue was cringe worthy. It was too long!!! I was waiting for it to end. Bring back JJ Abrams!!!!! ","true":true}
