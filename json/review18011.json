Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think The Last Jedi is excellent for me\\, but I don't know why audience give some low score. Maybe audience saw the film was slow or something lack. However\\, the film is still have some imagination\\, moral lesson and emotional feeling upon this film.","true":true}
