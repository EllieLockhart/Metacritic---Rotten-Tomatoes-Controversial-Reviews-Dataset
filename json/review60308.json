When I finish the game on the first Monday after it's release\\, I felt broken. I couldn't stop crying thinking about the hell of a journey I just testified. The writers of this game are very brave and courage to do what they've done\\, and they should be proud of it. It's not something revolutionary to entertainment but surely is something that will be talked about for years.There are moments on the story that you will hate\\, moments you will laugh\\, moments you will cry and the most important\\, moments to make you feel the love in this game. The museum's chapter has my favorite cutscene on game history by far. It was so well done that I played that chapter around 4 times\\, just to feel it again. However all this junk I wrote\\, it's just my opinion. If you haven't play it\\, give it a try and build up your own opinion\\, and don't just make it up from other people opinion. The game is not perfect at all\\, but I can't say it's not one of the best games ever made.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
