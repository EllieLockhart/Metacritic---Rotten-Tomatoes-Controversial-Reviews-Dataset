{"101487":104277,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A number of fanboys have suggested that \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201creal\u201d Star Wars fans don\u2019t consider this a \u201cproper\u201d Star Wars movie. Untrue. I\u2019m a real Star Wars fan and have been since I saw Return of the Jedi in the cinema when I was five (the first time it came out\\, not the Special Edition). And those whingers don\u2019t speak for me. Because I bloody LOVE this movie. JJ Abrams\\, terrified of doing badly\\, played it absolutely safe with The Force Awakens\\, down to practically cloning the plot of A New Hope\\, seemingly preparing to just tell the same story as the original trilogy. He gave us a bright\\, shining Jedi candidate of mysterious parentage (is she a Skywalker? Is she a Kenobi?)\\, the obligatory Skywalker heir\\, the dark master pulling his strings\\, the Death Sta...sorry\\, Death Planet. But he left all the questions to his successor to answer (who is Rey? Who is Snoke? What happened between Luke and Kylo?) and also left him with that ending - Rey holding out the lightsaber to Luke. And the fanboys speculated. They had their theories about Snoke (my only theory was that he was about the size of Yoda and had a Napoleon complex\\, hence the giant hologram). They had their theories about Rey. They predicted how things were going to go. Because it was all so PREDICTABLE. And then Rian Johnson came along and said\\, \u201cPredictable? No\\, thanks. Same old same old? Pass. I\u2019m gonna make an interesting\\, surprising Star Wars movie that has intelligence and strong philosophical ideas behind it\\, and is both literally and thematically about letting go of the past and exploring the possibilities of the new.\u201d Or something. And didn\u2019t those fanboys get upset. According to them\\, Star Wars is now dead (murdered by Disney\\, as though the owning conglomerate would feel compelled to dictate the actual content of a Star Wars movie \ud83d\ude44). The characters have been mangled beyond recognition (no evidence of that\\, though they have changed\\, which is a thing humans do). The force doesn\u2019t make sense (magic doesn\u2019t need to. *koff!*midichlorians*koff!*). They think that Disney has bullied or bribed the critics into giving it good reviews\\, which shows how well they handle differing opinions. Then there are those who decry the cast being even more diverse this time\\, claiming white genocide\\, misandry\\, SJW agenda\\, etc. But let\u2019s leave those morons out of this. Just because people with nothing else in their lives had their expectations contradicted\\, that doesn\u2019t make this a bad movie. Sure\\, the plot structure is a bit cumbersome (because there\u2019s so much going on)\\, Finn and Rose\u2019s mission lags a bit (but is still fun\\, has some interesting thematic elements\\, and Rose is awesome)\\, and the Poe\/ Holdo conflict is somewhat contrived\\, but the Luke\/Rey\/Kylo\/Snoke stuff is great. Like\\, REALLY great. I love the discussion\/exploration of heroes and legends\\, and the idea of failure as a means of growth. The \u201ckill the past\u201d stuff is fantastic\\, and truly invigorating. The acting is not poor\\, as has also been claimed. Far from it - Driver\\, Ridley\\, Hamill\\, Fisher\\, Isaac\\, Serkis and Gleeson are all AMAZING. Boyega isn\u2019t tested a great deal this time\\, but still does a great job. Ditto Gwendoline Christie. Kelly Marie Tran is also really good as Rose. Laura Dern is fine. Billie Lourd is fine. Benicio Del Toro isn\u2019t in it enough. ADRIAN EDMONDSON! \ud83e\udd18And the urchins are OK too. For kids. The movie is beautiful. Gorgeous sets and cinematography. The effects are \ud83d\udc4c John Williams\u2019s score is as great as ever. Fewer wipes than usual\\, but the between-scene editing is tighter\\, making that tricky. So\\, not a complaint\\, just an observation. I found this movie EXCITING\\, and not just in a thrilling\\, edge-of-my-seat action-adventure kind of way (though that too - hoo boy!). The thematic content and the character and plot developments really excite me\\, and make me more hopeful than ever about the direction the series might go in. I\u2019m now super psyched for Rian Johnson\u2019s new trilogy\\, and a lot more excited for Episode IX than I was for this after the last one. I just hope JJ decides not to play it safe this time.
