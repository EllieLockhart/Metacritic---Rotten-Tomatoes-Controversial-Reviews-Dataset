Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a Star Wars fan- it will disappoint you.\\n\\nIf you're a fan of logical coherency\\, plot consistency\\, engaging characters with depth\\, good pacing and don't like having to constantly suspend your disbelief- this will disappoint you.\\n\\nIf you like even the basic\\, surface aesthetic trademarks of Star wars\\, such as a lightsaber battle- heh\\, won't find much here. There plenty of spaceship battles- so much that it becomes saturated and boring.\\n\\nIf you're a little kid who likes watching spaceships fly and explosions go boom\\, sure.\\n\\nThe comedy is tasteless and awful; serious moments come off as hilarious. The pacing is slow and dense; plot holes as abundant as the spots you got from your last bout of chicken pox; the 'characters 'paper thin devices for carrying out certain plot points or messages\\, without actually becoming real characters\\, themselves\\, and heavily inflicted with Severely Stupid Syndrome all the way throughout. Conflicts are resolved with deux ex machine solutions and contrivances; nothing makes sense\\, and- the best part? It doesn't have to\\, because the directors never intended it to. They bought it\\, and they can do whatever they want with it. They can churn out whatever half-baked\\, sloppily executed and horrendously written script they want. Because\\, as long as they slap the Star Wars Logo onto it\\, they assume people will want to watch it\\, it will always make profit. There is no need for creative innovation or true vision here.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is just a cinematic version of a badly written Star wars  spitefic\\, who had a hatred for the Skywalker legacy and SJW agendas. It's shot prettily\\, though and BB-8 is cute.","true":true}
