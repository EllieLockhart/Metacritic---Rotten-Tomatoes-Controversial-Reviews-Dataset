Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie that everyone loves to hate delivers an exciting addition to the saga bringing new planets\\, new species\\, new spaceships. It strikes the right balance between innovation and familiarity with enough originality to make you satisfied.","true":true}
