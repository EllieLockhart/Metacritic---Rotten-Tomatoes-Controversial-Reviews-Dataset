Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account especially for this.\\n\\nDear God what a piece of shit movie. Ok let me rephrase this: what an outstanding disapointment this turns out to be.\\n\\nCharacter development is a MASSIVE let down. Premises established in the preceding episode are royally shat upon. New \\\"diversified\\\" (lol) characters you couldn't care less about (except perhaps Benicio Del Toro) are forcefed down your throat with nothing enticing to look for and old characters are literally thrown out the window (yeah I'm thinking about Leia -\\n she comes back from the window ;) in a fucking ridiculous scene I might add).\\n\\nEvery loose ends remain loose\\, none of your questions will be answered (if you had any) and nothing ends up tied. Looking forward to ignore the next installment altogether.\\n\\nA big fuck you from a SJW director that didn't realize he had a Star Wars movie in his hands","true":true}
