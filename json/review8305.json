Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Feels jumbled together. People who should have died didn't\\, and people who needed extra character development are cheated out of hit by people who should have lived in the next movie dying prematurely. Mostly I'm pissed about Admiral Akbar getting jobbed out with only a sideways reference to show for it. That's not cool.","true":true}
