The devs should be ashamed of them selves and not allowed to work on another game ever again. The story focuses more on the involvement of minorities than making an actually good sequel that builds on the story. The amount of unrealistic things in this game doesn't make sense in the universe the game takes place in and brings you out of the immersion. The writing isWorst 70\u20ac ever spent.

The amount of unrealistic things in this game doesn't make sense in the universe the game takes place in and brings you out of the immersion. The writing is horribly lazy and illogical which does a great job at punishing you for thinking too hard about the details in the story and the events that take place. If you hated the first game or if you're a straight up psychopath\\, you'll probably somewhat enjoy this monstrosity but I can't guarantee anything. This game does not deserve your time nor your hard earned money. Worst game I've ever played 0\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
