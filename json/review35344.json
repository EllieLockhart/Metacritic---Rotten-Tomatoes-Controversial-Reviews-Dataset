Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The internet made me hate this before seeing it. I watched and now can realize that this is the Episode V of our era\\, except there's a million times more pressure on it because of the past 40 years of culture we know. I can say surely that everyone's gripes with the \\\"you're a nobody\\\" and that ending shock will be blown away in IX. Star Wars never would quickly graze over anything so major without actual proof and let that stay in stone\\, remember this is the Episode V of this trilogy. Heck\\, just look at strength of Yoda's ghost - imagine what the most powerful Jedi's could be - and that's before you consider the circumstances of their departure as well... for all we know reappearing isn't out of the question.","true":true}
