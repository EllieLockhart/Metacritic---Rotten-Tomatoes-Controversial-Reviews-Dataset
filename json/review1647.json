Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie alone it is one of the poorest written movies I have watched. I found myself laughing at the plot decisions instead of laughing with the movie. As a Star Wars movie it felt like Rian Johnson had never seen a Star Wars movie or didn't care. It gets a 1 star because I thought all the actors did an excellent job in what they were given as material. The script felt like a first draft rushed out to production.","true":true}
