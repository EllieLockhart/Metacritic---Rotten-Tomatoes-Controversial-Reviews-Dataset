Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy hell. I'm 52 and have seen all 8 star wars movies ( plus the 2 side movies) in the theatre. I consider myself to be a huge star wars fan. Not after this streaming turd. Unwatchable. Princess Leah dies and floats through space? But wait! She's not dead! Um ok. A casino. Why? A prison cell  who is the mysterious guy? Who cares?An hour long chase. Who is chasing whom? why are they chasing them? Who knows? Who cares? It's action and exciting! Why is Luke so angry? Who knows? Why do Rey and the other characters have the personality and charisma of a wet dish rag? Who green lit this? How do I make it stop? Please God make it stop! This is so bad I won't waste my time seeing episode IX. This movie officially killed a franchise.","true":true}
