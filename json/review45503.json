Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed.  Snoke was meaningless.  Luke was not Luke and deserved better (at least an epic force\/lightsaber duel).  I mean\\, who cares if a billion lasers don't kill him when he isn't even there.  Clearly an effort to promote Disney's agenda.  Boo.","true":true}
