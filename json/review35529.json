Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has some really great scenes. But there are also this awkward jokes and logic issues. The most serious\\, however\\, is the damage this film leaves to the universe and its characters.","true":true}
