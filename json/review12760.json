Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created this account just to leave this review.\\nI genuinely cannot understand the hate this film is getting.\\n\\nSome seem to think it is PC propaganda. While not being a fan of PC (to put it lightly)\\, I simply cannot see how this is the case.\\n\\nOthers seem upset that their own fan-fiction and predictions are wrong. This is almost always the case anyway.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this film and thoroughly recommend it.","true":true}
