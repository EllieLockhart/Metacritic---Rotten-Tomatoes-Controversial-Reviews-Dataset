Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"What a beautiful game with a compelling story that makes absolutely no sense at all. Forget everything you know about the first one. Joel and Ellie are villains now\\, in fact they are the worst people in what\u2019s left in America\\, Joel especially. Man do they get that point across. Also you play as this new girl who may or may not have killed Joel for half the game. This new girl ultimately is about to kill Ellie half way through the game for killing her best friends earlier. Then you spend the next half of the game as this new girl killing the rest of her friends because she met this girl who thinks she is a boy who saved her. Ultimately this girl-boy convinces This new girl to not kill Ellie Despite the fact that she-he accompanies her all the way there to Ellie\u2019s hideout knowing full well what the plan was. Despite having been let off the hook twice by this new girl\\, Ellie still goes for revenge at the request of Tommy who survived a point blank gunshot to the head. Honestly I didn\u2019t think the player reviews would be true\\, but man this game made no sense and was all over the place. Still a fun game worth the money but a let down if you expected more of what the first one was about.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
