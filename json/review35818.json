Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn't the Star Wars movie you expect. Where The Force Awakens retread familiar ground\\, TLJ goes off the beaten path and attempts to do something new and bold while still retaining the charm and atmosphere of the previous movies. For the most part it succeeds and delivers poignant character moments\\, stunning visuals\\, and excellent action.\\n\\nWhile the movie is no means perfect\\, practically none are. The expectations for this film have created an environment in which its flaws will be criticized more harshly than they deserve.","true":true}
