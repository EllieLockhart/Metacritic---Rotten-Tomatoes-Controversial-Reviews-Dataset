Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was an atrocity. The good parts were the elements when there were no characters involved. It was CGI-porn for those who like star wars style ships.\\n\\nFirstly\\, there was an awful lot of air for space. Secondly\\, there were a lot of moronic elements that weren't thought through. Plot lines that would have made a great story were cut off in favor of 50 shades of the force between Rae and Kylo.\\n\\nIt didn't build anything upon the star wars universe\\, and could have be condensed into a 30 minute movie.","true":true}
