{"101487":164904,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS:\\n1) The plot was boring\\, made no sense at all\\, and it was full of holes.  I understand that it's sci fi and I need to suspend my disbelief\\, but none of this stuff makes any sense in the context of the movie.  A few examples:\\n- Most of the movie revolves in the good guys being stuck in a low speed chase against a fleet of star destoyers because ships can only go the exact same speed and the bad guys' weapons are only effective from close range.  This is stupid\\, but even if we accept it for what it is...The bad guys were able to destroy the rebel cruiser's bridge and hangar with only three fighters and no casualties\\, but then for some reason the bad guys call their fighters back because they \\\"can't support them\\\".  Why didn't the bad guys just send all their fighters out at once and crush the rebels?\\n- Why don't the bad guys just send a few star destroyers ahead and back again at light speed and head off the rebels?\\n- Why don't the bad guys call for reinforcements to head off the rebels?\\n- We are told the rebels have to get to a planet where they can alert their allies or call for reinforcements.  Okay\\, but then at one point Finn and random girl place a phone call to the alien with the glasses who tells them about the master codebreaker.  If they could call her\\, then why don't they just call for reinforcements\\, or even ask her to get the word out for them?  It makes all the drama about the chase and being stranded and alone seem totally pointless.\\n- Leia survived being blown up and shot into the vacuum of space for several minutes and then she hilariously used the force to fly back to the ship.  Why didn't they just kill her right then and there?  I thought it would have been a pretty good death scene for Carrie Fisher.\\n- Poe survived the hangar being blown up while everyone else around him died.\\n- Finn\\, random girl and Phasma survived the lightspeed attack on Snokes' flagship while everyone else around them died.\\n- Finn\\, a janitor\\, defeated Phasma in hand to hand combat.\\n- Why didn't the purple hair lady just tell Poe of her plan to sneak the rebels off on transports?\\n- Finn and random girl somehow flew to Space Monaco on a transport without being detected by the bad guys. If they knew how to do this\\, why didn't they suggest sneaking everyone off in the same manner?\\n- The bad guys somehow discovered a way to track ships through lightspeed without installing a tracker on their ship.  We are told this is a groundbreaking discovery\\, and comes as a shock to everyone in the movie.  Yet Finn (a janitor) and random girl (a mechanic) figure out in a few minutes exactly how to outsmart the tracker and alien-with-the-glasses knows exactly the guy they need for the job.  Remember\\, this is a technology none of them knew existed before a few minutes ago and it supposedly upends their understanding of science.  Ho hum.\\n- Finn and random girl didn't find the code breaker they wanted\\, but they by chance were put in the same cell as another code breaker who ALSO knows how to defeat the tracker.\\n- How was BB-8 able to disable and TIE UP three cops?\\n- Poe and his conspirators should have been punished for treason after they attempted a mutiny\\, or at least thrown in the brig.\\n- Why does someone have to stay behind with the rebel ships as they are abandoned?  Why not just put the ships on autopilot until the bad guys blow them up?  Seems like a pointless attempt at adding drama.\\n- You can't drop bombs in space.\\n- You can't suicide attack another ship using lightspeed.  If you could\\, why didn't the rebels do the same thing to either death star?  Why didn't they send a single fighter through the Dreadnought ship at light speed instead of sacrificing their entire bomber fleet?  Purple hair lady's suicide attack didn't make much of a difference anyway.  You could have just had a handful of transports escape while the rest were slaughtered.  Or\\, purple hair lady could have jumped off to somewhere else at light speed which would have forced the bad guys to choose between chasing her and finishing off the rest of the transports.  But her suicide attack was pointlessly thrown in because it was cool.\\n- Force ghosts can summon lightening now.\\n- Jedis can project holograms of themselves across the galaxy now.\\n- Poe took out every single cannon on the dreadnought ship with one x-wing because he's such a good pilot\\, and because an entire fleet of star destroyers is incapable of blowing up one fighter.  Why had the bad guys not already scrambled their fighters?\\n\\n2) Porgs\\, space horses and crystal foxes were added in a transparent attempt to appeal to little kids and sell toys.  This is ewoks and jar jar binks all over again.\\n\\n3) Too much preachy politics and social justice warrioring (this really came to a head during the Space Monaco sequence).  Oh\\, animal cruelty is bad.  We know this because the fat ugly alien is whipping the cute horses and stable kids.  Thanks Disney.  Oh\\, inequality is bad.  Thanks Disney.  Oh\\, arms dealing is bad.  Thanks Disney.\\n\\n4) Luke was a whiny b*tch and totally out of character.\\n\\nThat's all I got.  This is objectively a bad movie.  I give it two start because I liked some of the humor\\, and I think the cast did a great job with the acting.  I would tell you to save your money and not see this movie\\, but the amount of entertainment I am going to get from poking fun at it over beers with friends was worth the $9 price of admission.  Still\\, if this is what Star Wars is now\\, I'll save my money next time and wait until I can rent it.","true":true}
