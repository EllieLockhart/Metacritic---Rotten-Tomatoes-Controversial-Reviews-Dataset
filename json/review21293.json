Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this sequel with an open mind\\, knowing The Force Awakens was a recycled plot device from the first true trilogy. This film delivered an unpredictable Empire Strikes Back storyline that shifts the mythology further than ever before. The safety net has been removed and all the characters introduced in the J.J film have been course directed. This is a definitive Star Wars film and the mixed reception by fans is fantastic\\, this film will grow to become the best of the series within time. Gone is the generic storytelling that was simplifying the saga\\, we get an incredible story\\, that is matched by a ambitious vision. I'm impressed this film was made\\, what an ambitious film for that budget. Unpredictable and strong character arcs make up for the previous films simple plotting. 19-12-2017.","true":true}
