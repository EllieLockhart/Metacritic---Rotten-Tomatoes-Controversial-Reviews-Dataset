Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very unconventional Star Wars movie but it was very enjoyable.  Kylo Ren was a great character in this one and it was very exciting to see Luke Skywalker back in Star Wars.","true":true}
