Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Disney profit machine deforests another franchise. Weak plot with gaping holes which will take more than one movie to explain. Clearly the director was made to add elements which would make great merchandise rather than quality dialog and character development.","true":true}
