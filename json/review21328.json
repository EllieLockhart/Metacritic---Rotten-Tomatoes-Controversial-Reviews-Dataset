Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to the cinema with all the bad stuff i've heard about the movie and I honestly felt that this was maybe the best Star Wars film so far! Mark Hamill was great\\, Adam driver was awesome great directing! Snoke was a bit of a disappointment but still great movie. Don't stress too much about it.","true":true}
