Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many others\\, I created an account on here just to write a review for this disgrace. The more I think about this movie the angrier I get. I left the theatre wishing I could feel the way I felt after seeing The Force Awakens for the first time again. What even was the point of this entire movie??? Did Rain Johanssen even watch TFA?? John Boyega is one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood right now and he gets sidelined to a pointless B plot so Raymond can force us all to listen to Kyle Ron's manpain whining and see his gross nipples on the big screen for literally no reason. The complete misunderstanding of all the characters\\, especially the characters of color\\, in this movie is infuriating and pisses on all the opportunity for great character arcs that were set up in TFA. Can they let JJ Abrams make an episode 8.5 and episode 9 so we can pretend this installment never happened? Thanks.","true":true}
