Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The strangest thing about the public reaction to this movie is that everything that people are hating about this movie is everything that made the originals great\\, taking an established formula and turning it on it's head; taking what is expected\\, what is known about how a film is to unfold and shirking that for something new\\, something exciting\\, something unexpected. Johnson takes one of the greatest film franchises of all time and ensures that it will continue to be one of the greatest film franchises of all time by instilling it with new originality and excitement. The greatest injustice he could have perpetrated against the Star Wars legacy would have been to allow it to continue along the stagnant linear structure that The Force Awakens presented us with\\, to allow it to be just another Star Wars movie. Instead he decided\\, in the wisdom of a true filmmaker\\, to take a new direction\\, to allow this great film franchise to flourish; and\\, in doing so created\\, not only one of the best Star wars movies in the the canon\\, but one of the most daring and freshest takes on a beloved mythology I have ever had the pleasure to witness. Thankfully this director came along when he did\\, because it allowed one of my favorite film franchise of all time to do something it hasn't done in over 30 years... to surprise me.","true":true}
