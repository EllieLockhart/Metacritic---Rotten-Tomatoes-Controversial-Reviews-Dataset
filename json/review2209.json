Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first viewing\\, this film is a lot to digest if you're a Star Wars fan. If you're willing to accept its messages and big changes\\, then it becomes a compelling and invigorating entry into the mythos. Each and every character arc is meticulously constructed and executed to Johnson's vision. The performances are all stellar (this may be Hamill's best performance as Skywalker)\\, but chief among them is Driver's Kylo Ren.","true":true}
