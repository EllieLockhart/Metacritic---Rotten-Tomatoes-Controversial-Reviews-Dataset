Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed for all the obvious reasons.  The more I think about this movie\\, the more disgusted I am with it.  I was also not a fan of TFA\\, it was basically a rehash of New Hope\\, and now this nonsense\\, which rips off story from Empire and Return.  Daisy Ridley is also a master Jedi\\, nothing can stop her. I am not worried about her at all because she can not be defeated.  Ugh. Boo.","true":true}
