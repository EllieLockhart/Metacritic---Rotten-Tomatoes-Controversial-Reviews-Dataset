Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, this movie no doubt has great special effects 100%.  As a stand alone movie this could not even work because the main character is perfect.  She can do no wrong.  There are silly moments in the film such as the adventure in Canto byte.  As a Star Wars movie this failed.  It disrespects the characters of the original trilogy most especially Luke Skywalker.  ","true":true}
