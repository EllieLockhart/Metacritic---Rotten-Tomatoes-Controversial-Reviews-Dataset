{"101487":105075,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan I left the Cinema after watching this feeling really disappointed. The last Jedi basically threw out every story arc created by JJ Abrams in the force awakens. Who Reys parents are\\, Snoke\\, Knights of wren all thrown in the bin for whatever reason. It was all an up yours to JJ Abrams and his story from Force Awakens\\, making that film pointless. Every turn this movie took I felt was a let down\\, trying to be different for different sake.\\n\\nThe humour I found to be off\\, the film basically starts with a prank call ending in a Your Mother joke!\\n\\nThe story is the slowest space chase in history where some random resistance leader appears instead of say Ackbar and takes over as leader while a main character is out of action\\, but instead of letting anyone know what her plan is\\, keeps it a secret for whatever reason. Making Poe the resistance hero look like a moron the whole movie as he questions what's going on\\, thinking a traitor is aboard.\\n\\nFinn was off on a pointless side quest with a new character where we can learn that animal cruelty is wrong\\, rich people are bad\\, oh and so is child slavery if you didn't know. Ending in a terrible escaping on back of animals cgi laden scene.\\n\\nRey doesn't get taught anything from Luke which was such a let down. Luke was wasted badly in this film\\, this was not Luke we all knew from the original trilogy. Of course he would change over the years but not become what Rian Johnson created.\\n\\nThe ending for the middle of a trilogy was bizzarre\\, focused on a random kid staring into the stars insinuating a new hope is born rather than focusing on the heroes of the story. It deffinately didn't have me excited about what is going to happen next in episode 9.\\n\\nEffects were good as you would expect and I found everyone acted well with what they had to work with. I would class this as the worst Star Wars movie so far. Because Im weak I will probably buy this on Blu Ray at some point because I'm a Star Wars nut\\, but I wont pre-order like I did say Rogue One which was a great Star Wars story. My negativity is coming from someone who read all the EU books before they were just legend\\, so my thoughts on how great the continued story could be were high\\, with Force Awakens not dissapointing. Unfortunately my expectations for future Star Wars has really nose dived.\\n\\nRian Jonson really blew it with this one\\, Im not sure how JJ Abrams can pull this back for episode 9 unless he retcons multiple things from this movies story some how.","true":true}
