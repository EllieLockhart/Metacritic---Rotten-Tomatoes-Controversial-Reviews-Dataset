Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It takes a moment to understand the whole message\\, but it has a nice subtle present day political\/economical undertone to it  (especially on Canto Bight) and it is less fairy tale like the original and less political the the prequel. A nice balance. And I love it how Yoda tells Luke that he is a blind fool.","true":true}
