Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic film! Rian Johnson subverts expectations and shows fanboys that they are owed nothing. Rey and Kylo both have significant character development that makes everything from TFA worth it. The humor just landed with me (although I get why it doesn\u2019t sit well with others) and I think that Luke played exactly how he should have. Possibly the best film in the entire saga!
