Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of Star Wars and particularly Luke Skywalker I left this movie feeling destroyed.  I gather that was the goal of director Rian Johnson.  My wife wanted to walk out due to the ham-fisted in-your-face leftist political messaging.  I personally am sick of the left infecting and destroying everything we love and cherish in this country and now they have brought down the greatest movie franchise of all time. \\nOn the objective critical side the cinematography looks good and even great at times.  There are even fleeting moments of stirring emotion and interesting story telling but these moments are immediately trampled by extremely poor writing and mind-bogglingly bad story telling decisions throughout.  The Last Jedi destroys what we loved about Star Wars and replaces it with a dark empty hole. This movie IMO deserves -5 stars.  Kennedy and Johnson need to go before I'll see another Lucas Film product on screen.","true":true}
