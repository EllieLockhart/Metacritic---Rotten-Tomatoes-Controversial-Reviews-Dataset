Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly terrible and vapid with next to no character development and gives us no reason to care for the new cast at the expense and sacrifice of the OT cast. The movie simply had no soul and disrespected what came before \\\" Let the past die\\,Kill it if you have to\\\" thankfully this film is in the past and hopefully they do better. The Last Jedi was wasted and missed opportunity just to be nihilistic and subversive\\, Critics may love it but this will taint the series as a whole.","true":true}
