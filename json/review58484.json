Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing movie!  I am one of those fanboys to end all fanboys\\, I've read every book in the old EU\\, read every comic\\, played every game\\, etc..  Honestly I would put my nerd 'knowledge' up against just about anybody.  Luke is my spirt animal\\, and Luuke is my bane.  This movie is freaking beautiful\\, in just about every way.  \\n\\nI will admit that I\\, too\\, had some expectations when the new trilogy was announced as to where and what the new movies should take the GFFA we all know and love.  I have my favorite characters from the EU\\, and favorite plots and storylines\\, and I really wanted to maybe get the chance to see these amazing things on the big screen.  When Disney announced they were scrapping pretty much everything that wasn't on screen I was sad and mad\\, but the more I thought about it\\, the more it made sense.  \\n\\nThe expectations and pressures having to follow such an intense\\, and intensely...policed\\, 'history' moving forward\\, was incredibly limiting.  I know fanboys are an passionate group\\, but if you think about it how could Disney have possibly have moved forward with SW in a way that all good stories need; mystery.\\n\\nThe EU covered so much freaking 'history'\\, hundred of thousands of years\\, with so many freaking characters\\, and plots and arcs and what have you\\, that I think no matter what\\, Disney was going piss people off just trying to get it right.  \\nSo they had a choice to make; follow the strictures laid down by fandom\\, or keep some cool ideas\\, but move forward.  And thats what The Last Jedi is about.  Moving forward.  \\n\\nStar Wars is not just about the Skywalkers\\, it can't be\\, and in the old EU\\, it never was.  Luke\\, Leia\\, Han\\, Chewie\\, even 3PO and R2\\, just couldn't be the focus going forward.  And to me\\, the way they handled Han in TFW\\, Luke and Leia in TLJ are perfect.  Luke\\, by the end of the EU was incredibly powerful\\, but his humanity was sometimes lacking.  He was the 'Grand Master'\\, the Last Jedi Master\\, the Hero of the Rebellion\\, etc..  And quite frankly it was hard to find believable story lines for him.  Towards the end\\, it took the literal manifestation of the Dark Side to give him a true challenge.\\n\\nBut Luke in TLJ is far more human!  And thats a good thing!  If even Yoda\\, a Jedi Master for 800 years\\, acknowledged as one of the most powerful jedi ever\\, can fail\\, over and over again\\, then a farm boy can as well. \\n\\nIt seems to me a lot to the criticisms stem from some sort of perceived lack of 'respect' for the old characters\\, but I think if you just let go of your expectations\\, of what you think should happen\\, and try to view TLJ for what it is\\, I think you'll find it is an incredible Star Wars movie\\, that moves the saga forward.  \\n\\nIt is legit beautiful movie\\, with great acting and amazing action","true":true}
