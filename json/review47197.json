Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an awful movie. Terrible plot; ridiculous depiction of TWO militaries for something calling itself Star Wars; Mary Sue characters abound; worse love story than Attack of the Clones; wooden acting; worst Star Wars dialogue ever (and that's saying something). There's more\\, but I would rather forget about this movie after suffering through it. It's really unwatchable garbage. Do yourself a favor: if you haven't seen this\\, don't.","true":true}
