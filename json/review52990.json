Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan who has followed the franchise since May 1977\\, I was deeply disappointed after watching this movie. The movie is bad\\, but it goes beyond that as it does its best to disappoint hardcore fans (you know\\, those of us who buy the merchandise and see the movie 7 times). Had this simply been a bad movie\\, it would have left me upset\\, but not worried. I'm literally worried that this beloved franchise is being killed by the hands of a director who chooses to amuse himself instead of respecting the franchise and its characters. And to then turn around and suggest that the massive push-back from fans is merely a case of the \\\"loud but few minority\\,\\\" is ridiculous. This\\, make no mistakes about it\\, is a bad movie on many fronts. I fell asleep upon my second viewing. That has never happened to me before with this beloved franchise. RJ was tying to write a comedy maybe\\, or perhaps he wanted to create something different. But he failed to understand that different\\, still needs to be good\\, and a comedy\\, is not what Star Wars is. His attempts at introducing comedy failed and produced cringe-worthy moments. Luke drinking from the breast of that sea animal was not funny just embarrassing. Luke wanting to kill (if even for a second) his sister's son\\, is not the Luke we all know.  I hope JJ somehow brings this franchise back to where he intend it to go. A very disappointing film with a very disappointing ending. I'm a huge Disney fan\\, but I just don't know what's going on with them and this franchise right now. Very confusing.","true":true}
