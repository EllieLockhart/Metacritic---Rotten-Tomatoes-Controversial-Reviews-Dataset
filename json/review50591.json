Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"30+ year Star Wars fan. Don\u2019t listen to the haters. It\u2019s not perfect\\, but it\u2019s astounding and fantastic. It\u2019s extremely rich and deep\\, story and character-wise. Lots of fan service\\, but not too much. Rewards multiple viewings and warrants many hours of discussion and analysis. Can also be enjoyed in a relaxed manner. ","true":true}
