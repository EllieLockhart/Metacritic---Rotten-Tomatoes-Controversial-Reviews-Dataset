Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most pervasive Star Wars character thru the decades is Luke Skywalker. His portrayal as a crotchety old curmudgeon divorced from the struggle & the Force throws a thin shroud of pessimism\\, even confusion over the whole concept of the Force. From the weird chases in CasinoWorld\\, to the illogical existence of the code breaker\\, there were too many impossible scenes that were not believable. So many square pegs stuffed into round holes.","true":true}
