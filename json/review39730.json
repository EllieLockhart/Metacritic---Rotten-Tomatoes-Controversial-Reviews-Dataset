Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie and it's a shame not everyone sees it. Yes\\, it is more challenging than TFA\\, but why is that a bad thing?? It's a better movie\\, and with that often comes a more divisive reception i suppose. It is uncliched\\, beautiful\\, emotional\\, and IMO a film that captures the spirit of star wars better than any previous post ROTJ film. Boom. Go see it y'all.","true":true}
