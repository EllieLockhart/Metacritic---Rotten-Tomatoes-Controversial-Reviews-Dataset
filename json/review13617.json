Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt that this was one of the best well-written Starwars movies out there. If you're an old-timer and are stuck on the original trilogy this movie is not for you but if you're somebody who's looking to expand the Star Wars Universe in a way that's logical this is the movie. I love the fact that it did not take itself too seriously and the humor was quite appropriate not like Jar Jar Binks. I will definitely be seeing this movie again in the theater shortly.","true":true}
