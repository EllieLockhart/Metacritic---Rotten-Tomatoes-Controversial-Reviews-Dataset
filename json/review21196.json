Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched it in awe and fascination just as I had when I saw the original movie 40 years ago. It's visually breathtaking with a story that is easy to follow and keeps moving along. The only downside is that this is the \\\"middle\\\" movie in the trilogy so we have almost a two and a half year wait for the conclusion. Go see it\\, ignore what all the hipster with hatred are posting.","true":true}
