Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea where to begin on this one. To start I will commend Rian Johnson for attempting to breathe new life into Star Wars and take it into a new direction. He took some serious risks\\, for he did not have a formula that JJ Abrahams did in TFA\\, where much of the plot was rehashed from EP4. This was the first original movie made since Return of the Jedi\\, the others\\, the plot was already predetermined for the most part. The prequels were a historical path to where we are now. Some of the stuff works\\, and unfortunately some of it missed the mark. They attempted to inject some more lighthearted dialogue in this one and I thought it fell flat - most of the comedic moments were Harrison Ford\u2019s in the past and his dry wit was what made it work. In this movie it just sounded forced and corny\\, you didn\u2019t know if you were watching a SNL skit or a movie\\, especially the part with a character from old that I will not spoil\\, it was unfortunately terrible. There were some great action sequences\\, but the light saber scenes were missing and\/or meaningless. Much of the questions left from TFA were not really answered\\, he really didn\u2019t push the plot along\\, he just kicked the can down the road. Some of the new characters were interesting and different but served only brief purposes which will make it hard to see how they come back for EP9. The character development was lacking\\, I thought after TFA we would be getting deeper attraction to them but after watching this I feel ambivalent. Hamill was very good\\, but I can now understand his displeasure in the writing of this script - he has many points. In all\\, this was not the worst SW movie\\, somewhere in between Strikes Back and TFA. The plot was so open ended on this one I can only imagine where they go from here\\, JJ has his work cut out for him to bring this thing all to a closure that is satisfying. As for Star Wars fans\\, we are only left to wonder what could have been","true":true}
