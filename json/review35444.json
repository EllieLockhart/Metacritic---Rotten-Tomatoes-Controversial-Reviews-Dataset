Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi\\, destoys everything JJ abrahams plan for this trilogy its painfull to watch\\, What rian johnson did is just setting the bases for his own trilogy in the future that disney promise to him","true":true}
