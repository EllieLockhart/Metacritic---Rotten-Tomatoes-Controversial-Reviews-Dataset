Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie not Star Wars we love.  Luke is a sniveling scared little man clearly in this is a movie. This is for feminists as it makes Luke a weak man.  And make a female character the main character who's more powerful than anybody with little or no Jedi training.  The plot is absolutely horrible and I will not go see episode 9.  Rian Johnson who wrote and directed this film should be ashamed of himself it's a terrible movie.","true":true}
