Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved all the star wars movie except this one. It was boring\\, poorly written\\, overrated\\, cheesy\\, did not make sense\\, bad acting\\, cash grab. The overwhelming positive review from the critics really makes me question their motivations because I do not believe the majority of them enjoyed it so much.","true":true}
