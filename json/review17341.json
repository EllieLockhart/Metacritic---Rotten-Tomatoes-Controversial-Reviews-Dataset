Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember in June 1977 when the first movie came out. I have read almost all of the extended universe books since.  Theoretically\\, I suppose\\, this movie might have been worse\\, but it feels like a gross violation of the franchise and the true believers.  I like Walt Disney\\, but this destruction of a unique ecosystem blights their reputation. Calling this a Star Wars movie is a farce. Enjoy it if you like\\, but don't pretend it is a Star Wars story.","true":true}
