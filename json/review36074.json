Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi took the universe in a bold new direction. None of my expectations were hit\\, because they took the story in a direction I never could have imagined. Kylo was developed in an amazing way\\, Finn grew into his character a lot more\\, and we got more of Poe\\, which was already amazing\\, and Oscar Isaac is great. \\n\\nThe movie is obviously not without flaws\\, some character's motivation isn't explained well\\, and is sometimes ignored entirely. And of course\\, some questions raised in TFA were not answered\\, or were\\, but in a way that no one really wanted to be the case. The beginning was a little messy\\, but the payoff was brilliantly executed.\\n\\nVisually\\, the film is stunning. Crait was an amazing setting that proved great for a beautiful sequence. The space combat was visually stunning\\, the new First Order ships are amazingly designed and realized in the film. Kylo's Silencer is the coolest small craft in the series. They pushed boundaries visually\\, and lore wise. \\n\\nThis movie also showcased hands-down some of the best action any Star Wars film has ever produced. My jaw was literally on the floor multiple times.\\n\\nI am impressed with their ability to push the series into a direction that I couldn't fathom\\, and open the story to be something other than a story that we all would have guessed\\, and in a year full of seemingly fan-servicing hows\\, this was refreshing. I genuinely have no idea what is coming next\\, and I really like that. TFA did a great job bringing us back in with something familiar\\, and TLJ is pushing us in a bold new direction. I can't wait for what is next.","true":true}
