Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, long subplot that ends up being completely pointless. Too damn many stupid jokes\\, even during serious moments. New\\, unnecessary characters in place of old beloved ones. Artificial drama to extend the running time. Utter destruction of what was supposed to be one of the strongest characters in the SW universe. Killing off of the main villain without ever explaining what he was all about. And Leia flying through space... Perfect example of why no one should listen to movie critics.","true":true}
