Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some good scenes\\, but the bad scenes we're so distracting that it ruined the movie overall. Rian Johnson's decision to kill so many of JJ Abram's interesting plot details was a terrible decision reminiscent of a petulant child.","true":true}
