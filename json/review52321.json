Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie needs more then a pretty picture with light sabers and space ships. It needs interesting characters with relevant plot lines that have depth. Besides Kylo Ren and maybe Rey\\, no one else is interesting and the plots lines are literally pointless. The big twists turn out to be that they aren't big twists\\, and the director decides to just redo the light verse dark side again. Nothing new.","true":true}
