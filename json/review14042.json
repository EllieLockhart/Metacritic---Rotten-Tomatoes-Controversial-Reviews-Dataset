Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you loved jar jar binks\\, then you will love this movie.  fan of boss nass?  you'll adore rose and admiral holdo!  if you couldn't get enough of the ewok babies\\, you'd probably buy all the porg merch.  but if you are a male fan over the age of 13\\, we got BAD news for you buddy.  save your money and watch this on streaming.","true":true}
