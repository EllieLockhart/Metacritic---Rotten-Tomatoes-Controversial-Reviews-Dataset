Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was on the edge of my seat\\, I laughed\\, I cried. I received some answers and I love that some mysteries still remain --- it is a trilogy after all. I was bittersweet to see Leia alive\\, one last time and after not having much (nothing) to say in TFA\\, Luke killed it in TLJ. I will go and see it again\\, to see all the things I missed the first time.","true":true}
