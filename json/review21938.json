Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw this for the 2nd time\\, and this totally changed my opinion! I had seen it first\\, as part of a double feature in IMAX on preview night\\, and left the theatre extremely confused about what I just saw. As days went by thinking about it\\, I started to dislike it more and more. I then thought\\, maybe seeing it again\\, without just watching The Force Awakens\\, might help....and sure enough it did! Seeing it again\\, made me notice the potential foreshadowing that could be going on\\, and I just found a deeper appreciation for the twists that took place\\, as they made more sense to me. Highly recommend a 2nd viewing\\, if like me\\, you were torn apart by the initial screening.","true":true}
