Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was absolutely amazing\\, I have no idea why people can be so hateful about it. The only part I didn't like was the part where Leia somehow survived being sucked out into space but I was so swept away in how awesome literally everything else was I forgot about that in like 2 seconds.","true":true}
