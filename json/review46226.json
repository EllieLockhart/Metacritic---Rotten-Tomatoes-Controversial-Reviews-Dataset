Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.\\nAfter we witnessed the character assassination of Han in TFA\\, followed by his actual murder on screen\\, we get to witness the utter character assassination of Luke in TLJ... and his death - with some attempt at dignity. We also witness the character assassination of Rey. She is not Luke's daughter\\, no. She is no Skywalker. She is just a plot device tool to forward the story of Kylo Ren. Oh girls\\, we were so close! But we've hit another \\\"glass ceiling\\\". And Leia - what the hell is the purpose of this whole trilogy - neither JJ nor Johnson have ANY idea what to do with her... Except make her deal with the worst crap\\, over and over. And now Carrie is dead\\, so the whole original trio is done for\\, with BAD ENDING for all of them. This is NOT what Star Wars stood for!","true":true}
