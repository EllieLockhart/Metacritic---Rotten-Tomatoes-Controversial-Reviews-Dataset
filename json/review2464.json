Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Very nice Star Wars Movie\\, fresh and very good story and script\\, dynamic beat between the scenes\\, full of action and emotional moments\\, solid characters developing following the Hero's Journey monomyth of Joseph Campbell like George Lucas did before in the original trilogy. Excellent visual effects with amazing worlds. The Last Jedi has everything you want to see from Star Wars movie.","true":true}
