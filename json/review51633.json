Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dark day for Star Wars fans. Forty years of this amazing universe\\, brought down all at once. A tragedy. There\u2019s nothing I can add that hasn\u2019t already been pointed out. The Last Jedi is a disaster of a film\\, and an even worse Star Wars film. There is no need to see episode IX after witnessing this mess.","true":true}
