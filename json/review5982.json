Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  The story is a sad parody of what it could have been.  Great nods to the old star wars movies but they really screwed the story and Luke. So much of this movie was irrelevant and quite unnecessary.","true":true}
