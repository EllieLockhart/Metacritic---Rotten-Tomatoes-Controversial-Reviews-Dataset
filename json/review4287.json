Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By revealing that there is no believable way how we got from Episode 6 (Rebellion Wins) to Episode 7 (Empire on top after a rebranding exercise)\\, this movie reveals the original trilogy is not a sequel\\, it's a complete reboot. If you watch this movie (the movie called Episode 8) expecting it to play in the same universe as the original trilogy\\, this movie is way worse than just bad. If you watch it as a reboot\\, it's tolerable\\, but it belongs to the typical Superhero movies that lack internal consistency\\, is full of Deus Ex machinas\\, has no character depth\\, and everything just seems random.","true":true}
