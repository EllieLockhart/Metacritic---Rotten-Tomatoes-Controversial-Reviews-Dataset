Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many holes\\, some great moments\\, but the return of Luke that I waited 30 years for was abysmal and wasted.  I felt confused as to why I wasn't thrilled as with The Force Awakens.  I TRIED.  I tried to love this movie but it just didn't happen and I just left annoyed and disappointed.  Great job\\, Disney (said with great sarcasm).","true":true}
