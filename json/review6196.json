Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has done a great job of completely dismantling what I consider the centerpiece of my childhood. Politically correct themes\\, unnecessary and out of place humor\\, the neutering of Luke Skywalker and the overall \\\"Disneyfication\\\" of the new Star Wars leaves me saddened\\, angry and desperately hoping a complete 180 degree shift will occur with the next movie lest my greatest cinematic love be forever lost and in absolute ruin.","true":true}
