Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is Easily the worst Star Wars movie. It's a bad movie to begin with and if it wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, people would just ignore it mostly. But as it has expectations\\, money\\, and backstory  invested in it\\, it's terrible and disappointing to the point of rage and depression and inducing.","true":true}
