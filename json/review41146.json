Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie has been a continuation of the death of the star wars franchise although the space battles and effects were terrific the rest of the movie centers around the unrealisticly over powered female(rey) and the diversity hire (rose). In the force awakens rey was established as the new main character with kylo being the villain however for some reason rey doesn't need any fucking training to take on a SITH APPRENTICE  while kylo instead of being the typical sith badass [plotting brooding and slaughtering] he acts like a little bitch that throws temper tantrums when he gets angwy.  in this movie the same dichotomy is continued however some of the other new characters like finn and po dameron get totally shit on. in this movie our favorite new kickass pilot gets totally emasculated by the shit brain gender studies professor they hired to play the substitue admiral.  finn on the other hand gets to take a back seat ride with the new diversity hire I mentioned earlier rose. rose essentially has no fucking place in this movie what so ever but she there regardless. overall another shitty sequal to a great franchise i once loved.","true":true}
