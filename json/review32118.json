Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers The twist of the Luke sky walker fight is that you can\u2019t kill him because he\u2019s not there. And then he immediately dies? He might as well have been there.","true":true}
