Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll summarise. Spoilers ahead.\\n\\nThe jokes fall flat\\, the pacing sucks ass and is ridiculously fast\\, the plot gets somewhat muddled due to scene changes at odd times\\, the plot is fairly predictable and convenient (even for me\\, and I'm usually retarded when it comes to this sort of thing)\\, the Star Wars soundtrack is still the Star Wars soundtrack (nothing new here at all)\\, the characters sometimes do things which don't make sense\\, the cgi fails horrifically in one shot\\, various logical flaws throughout\\, fan service is too disruptive with the actual plot\\, fan service fails to mix with the plot in a way which doesn't make me say \\\"oh how convenient\\\" while rolling my eyes\\, why the fuck is yoda still here and why does he look like his animation look like something out of the muppets\\, why are there so many scenes with seemingly no significance to the plot\\, why is Mark Hamill\/Luke invincible to dying both from fire and cannons???\\n\\nThere is literally bothing about this film which I can say stood out as being positive. But there were plenty of problems. \\n\\n1.5\/5","true":true}
