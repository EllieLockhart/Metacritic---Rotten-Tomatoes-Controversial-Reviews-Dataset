Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good visual effects\\, the plot is questionable to say the least. I was disappointed with the direction of this movie coming off the Force Awakens which I liked. Still puzzled with the story choice.","true":true}
