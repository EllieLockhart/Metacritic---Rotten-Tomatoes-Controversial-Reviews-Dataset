Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie literally sh-ts on the entire franchise. I used to think that the movie had some redeeming qualities like the throne fight scene.. until I saw the fight slowed down. Now I truly see what a cluster fu-k this movie really is. Extremely saddened by this outcome of Disney\u2019s Star Wars. ","true":true}
