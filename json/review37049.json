Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new characters are awful they ruined luke Skywalker and the story made little sense.. Disney should have just stuck with remaking the first trilogy and I could have tolerated it like the force awakens..this critics score just shows you that the majority of these people are just corporate puppets.. I probably wouldn't even watch this on stars if it was free.. it doesn't feel epic\\, makes you walk out and say why.. it's garbage","true":true}
