{"101487":121254,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, I am not a bot.\\nSecond I need to say the score on here ( currently 50%)  seems high. I have been reading as many reviews as possible and the numbers do not seem to be in line. But maybe this is my error...\\n\\nLife long fan of the movies\\, but I went into the movie ( TLJ ) with no preconcied ideas or hopes... I was however hoping to see a good movie... this di not happen.\\n\\nTo the people out there giving this .... horrid trash a 5 star rating\\, what did you all go see ? Seriously\\, not to diminish your opinion\\, but give me and everyone else that did not like it\\, points as to what you thought was fresh\\, new\\, and interesting. \\n\\nI see comments \\\" Best movie ever\\, loved it ! \\\"  or similar\\, but with no details as to what the person thought was so new and wonderful. Please help the rest of us that are so confused and disgusted by this movie with some details as to what you found all so wonderful to give it 5 stars... please.\\n\\nI can tell you all the things that are new\\, in bad ways.  \\n\\n(bad) \\nThe rebelion is fighting for over 40 years\\, proves it is viable\\, and capable\\, killed off the emperor\\, got vader out of the way and destoys the 2 death stars\\, and the First Order planet killer...but for all its effort has next to 0 support.  no ships\\, no people no fuel.... this is the basic begining to the story..... Seriously ?\\n\\n( bad) \\nThe..phone call from Poe to general Haux is beyond stupid\\, humor for no reason\\, and takes away haux as any sort of character you can take serious.\\n\\n( sort of stupid but ok) \\nDroping bombs in space....? ok... I will give them this one\\, the ships have magnetic fields... I give this a maybe \/ its not out of possiblity.  \\n\\n(bad)\\nforced humor. One example\\, and there are many... but when Poe and BB8 survive the expolsion on the fight deck\\, you see all the others on the deck killed...and BB8 rolls into the scene with its idiotic comical beeping ( look everyone I am ok\\, dont worry I am just fine)  All the others are dead and is no moment for the audience to feel any sort ocf emotional loss to all those that were just killed. In previous films  ( a new Hope ) you felt some emotionla loss\\, as I think you should. \\n\\n(bad)\\nSnoke.... anyone know anything about him ? Please..share with the group. If he was so all important\\, or powerful\\, why in no other star wars literature\\, book\\, game\\, movie is name mentioned once.  There is 0 \/ nada. We do not know where he came from\\, how he was injured\\, how he came to power... nothing. In an established  with a history you cant do this and expect people to buy into it. And now he is dead...so ....??   This is not only bad its stupid.\\n\\n( bad) \\nRose and Fin\\, the actors are fine\\, the characters are bland\\, uninteresting.  The casino planet was .. OMG a waste of time.  And Fin with captain Phazma.... Seriously?\\n\\n(bad \/ horrible) \\nRey\\, Ren\\, Leia  and Luke.... OMG....I could write a book on this.  now a jedi only needs 2 lessons to be a master ?   Or no lessons in the case of Leia. She can fly in space \/ survive a vacum\\, bring herself back from the dead...Not any of the powerful jedi or Sith had this power...but she now is more powerful then any before her.... wow.\\n\\nLuke.... the man who could see Vader was still good\\, and spare his life.... could decide that his nephew was going to be to bad and needed to be killed. What ? Did the writers not see any of the previous movies ? Or read a book or two ? What was Luke going to say to Han and Leia?' \\\" Ben was going to be bad...I killed him...sorry..whats for dinner ? Got Milk ?? \\\"  Lukes character a disgrace.\\n\\nThe movie plot\\, terrible. Visuals\\, yup\\, top marks\\, but for a movie with such a horrible plot that is not enough.\\n\\nkids now can move things with the force with no training where in the past it took years\\, and years of training.\\n\\nI could say so much more\\, but others have done so before me.\\n\\nAll the old movies\\, books\\, games everything was tossed to make this new movie\\, and to be honest i do not understand why.\\n\\nI think Kylo ren sums up Disneys opinon of fans and the star wars universe build by Lucas and the 40 years of storys up to \\\" the Force awakens\\\" I gthink disney had a hidden messages in the words of Kylo ren.\\n\\n\\\" Let the past die...kill it if you must \\\"\\n\\nDisney\\,  has done exactly that.","true":true}
