Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It will make you laugh\\, cry\\, and feel hope for the next generation. A must see multiple times\\, with friends\\, and again with family. Last Jedi truly marks a hopeful future for the franchise to remove the disdain of the prequels.","true":true}
