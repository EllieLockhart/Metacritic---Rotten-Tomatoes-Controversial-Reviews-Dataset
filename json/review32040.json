Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*** Spoilers *** Movie was designed to eliminate the heroes of the past so the franchise can move on. I waited for two movies and many years to see Luke be portrayed as a pathetic old Jedi with none of the powers of the original continuity stories. In those books he didn\u2019t have to do a projection to survive such fire power as he did in the end. Could have just put Loki into that role and had the same experience. Luke\u2019s death was a big disappointment and a waste. Oddly the one character that should have had a screen departure (Leia) was the only one that isn\u2019t gone except for the droids.","true":true}
