Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I struggle to find the words for how great this movie is. Every time I watch it\\, I expect it not to live up to my memory. And every time it exceeds it.\\n\\nThe Canto Bight scenes miss the mark though.","true":true}
