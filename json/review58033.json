Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who is Snoke? Doesn't matter. Who are Rey's parents? Doesn't matter. How is Leia able to do a Mary Poppins number? Don't worry about it. How is Luke able to do the astrological projection? Don't worry about it. What happened to Y-wing bombers? Don't worry about it. We replaced them with bulky bombers that fire all or none (and use gravity in space). Why isn't lightspeed kamikaze used anywhere else in Star Wars? Don't worry about it! The humor also didn't fit in a Star Wars movie. Finn and Rose's adventure was a waste of time\\, and there are so many other plot holes around that part of the story I can't even count them...","true":true}
