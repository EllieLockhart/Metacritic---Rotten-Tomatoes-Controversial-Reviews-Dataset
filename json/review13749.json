Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I were to give a one word review of The Last Jedi\\, that word would be\\, \\\"unexpected.\\\" Even if you don't include expectations built up before the release\\, the movie surprises you every step of the way. Any time you think a character or situation will go one way\\, the movie does what you'd least expect. This is the Star Wars of the future\\, and this long time fan couldn't be happier.","true":true}
