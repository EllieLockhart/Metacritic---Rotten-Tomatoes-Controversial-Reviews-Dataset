Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi left me feeling angry\\, disappointed and actually depressed.  I felt the same as I did and I watched Isis destroying ancient statues in the museum with sledgehammers.\\n\\nStar Wars is special and unique and I felt all the history and legacy was just razed to the ground.  Everything special about it thrown away and turned into a meaningless empty spectacle with plenty of flashes and bangs.  It seemed to be wearing its nonsensical and illogical plot as a badge of pride.  Same also with the trashing of Luke skywalker at the Jedi tradition and legacy.\\n\\nThe greatest hero of the universe gets given a physical beating by some girl so Luke is left cowering on the floor as Ray menaces him with her lightsaber.\\n\\nI find I was very creepy political propaganda throughout\\, unregulated\\, with no mandate\\, very creepy indeed.\\n\\nLike some dumb schmo I've just realised the gross milk drinking scene was of course anti-milk drinking propaganda.\\n\\nI will never forget what they did to my treasured and beloved heroes and legacy of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
