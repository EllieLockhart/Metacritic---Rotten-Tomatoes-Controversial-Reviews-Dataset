Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the absolute WORST Star Wars film to date.  I would prefer watching the Christmas special over this because\\, at the very least\\, it's enjoyable to watch to make fun of.\\nThis movie was an absolute flop for me.  So many things were wrong and I felt no tension throughout the entire movie because rei is a Mary Sue.","true":true}
