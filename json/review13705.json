Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally watched this movie. It is not an exaggeration to say this is the worst live action Star Wars I have ever seen by a far margin. Yes\\, this is worse than the infamous 1978 Holiday Special.","true":true}
