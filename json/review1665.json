Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie -- it was quite good.\\n\\n\\nAs a STAR wars movie -- it was HORRIBLE!\\n\\nThe director NEVER ever knew any lore. He tried to be \\\"original\\\" as all bad directors do these days and destroy the franchize.\\n\\nThis is not star wars. This is \\\"Sell Wars -- the different Movie!\\\"\\n\\nI will not only probably skip any Ryan Johnson movie as of yet\\, but Episode 9 is no go for me. I cannot support such decision making and i urge every FAN to boycot the sales of Porgs\\, Star Wars figures and movie tickets.\\n\\nThank you\\,\\nDimitar","true":true}
