Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing twice after waiting a week\\, I still just don't like the portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the Last J\\nedi.  Even Mark Hamill is having trouble personally accepting what became of Luke Skywalker.  It's hard to enjoy an otherwise awesome movie while feeling profound disappointment over the pitiful disgusting wretch that my childhood hero became. \\n\\nhttp:\/\/mashable.com\/2017\/12\/21\/mark-hamill-last-jedi-not-my-luke-skywalker\/#MUx3ZGkDZOq0","true":true}
