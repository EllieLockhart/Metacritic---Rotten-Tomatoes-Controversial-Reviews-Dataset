The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The original game was one of the best games I ever played\\, the story was great and the two main characters\\, Joel and Ellie\\, were the main reason I liked the game so much. Just completed the Part II\\, totally disappointed!\r\rThe story was bad\\, and the characters you loved in the original were ruined or destroyed. The worst part was that you were forced to play Abby who brutally murdered Joel so that you may like her and won't feel bad when Ellie let her live in their final fight.\r\rIn the original game\\, that damned doctor was trying to kill Ellie to make a so-called vaccine\\, but when the fireflies woman asked him \\\"will you do it if she is your daughter?\\\"\\, he simply could not answer the question\\, apparently he can sacrifice other innocent people but not his daughter. So what is wrong with Joel when he killed the doctor to save Ellie who he cared about so much by the end of their journey after losing his own daughter at the beginning of the story? The game creator created a revenge theme in the sequel\\, it's a shame on you trying to un-justify Ellie's revenge while trying to justify the other.\r\rThis game also tried hard to tarnish the relationship between Joel and Ellie built and developed in the original game. Why did Ellie hate Joel so much in this game? Was it because Joel saved her and prevented her from being made a vaccine to save the humanity? Give me a break\\, that's so ridiculous! The game even let Ellie lost two fingers\\, so she could no longer play the guitar Joel gave to her and left it behind at the end of the game\\, what a joke!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
