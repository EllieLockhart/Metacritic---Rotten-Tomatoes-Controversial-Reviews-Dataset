Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was almost perfect. The only isues I had were there were a few too many jokes at serious moments and the cgi wasn't as good as in the force awakens. \\nThe plot was really well paced and fast like a lot of Star Wars movies. It really keeps you hooked the whole movie it doesn't feel like you're sitting there for two and a half hours.  Some use of the camera movement was a  different from other Star Wars movies but not really bad there was a lot of use of the quick closing in movemt in this movie which was again not bad but could be used a few times less. I personally felt like I could notice a lot more cgi in this film compared to tfa and rogue one but there was a good use of practical effects which is always a great thing. Overall this movie was one of the best if not the best Star Wars movie ever especially plot wise.","true":true}
