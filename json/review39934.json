Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily one of the best Star Wars movies of the entire Saga.  Disney Star Wars has learned the mistakes of the prequel trilogy and remembered that\\, at it's core\\, with all it's laser swords and space wizards and crazy spaceships\\, that Star Wars is for kids.  The movie is fun\\, has just the right amount of humor but still manages to wield that dark desperation of being on the losing side of a conflict.  \\n\\nEven with the support of the actors from the original trilogy\\, the movie didn't let them steal the show.  The new cast of heroes are bright\\, young\\, flawed and amazing to watch.  You can tell that these actors grew up with Star Wars as part of their life\\, and acting in these roles is incredibly important to them.   \\n\\nThis is an amazing addition to the legacy of Star Wars\\, and I can't to see the next one.","true":true}
