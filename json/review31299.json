Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some cool moments\\, no doubt a decent time for casual viewers\\, but too much good setup wasted for me to say I was satisfied. Most frustrating part of this movie was Laura Dem's character who irrationally created a bunch of conflict by keeping her plan to herself and letting Poe die inside at her decisions. Poe would have been on her side if she used a little communication\\, such a dumb plot point.","true":true}
