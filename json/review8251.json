Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far and away one of the worst entries in the series! ***SPOILERS***This movie was supposed to be about Jedi stuff. Instead\\, we get a 2 hour \\\"chase\\\" scene as the First Order simply waits for the Resistance to burn out their fuel reserves while some other smaller events are happening elsewhere. The Porgs and really every other \\\"animal\\\" in this movie are worse than Jar-Jar Binks. At least Jar-Jar had dialog and a purpose for being in the film. These animals are strictly an attempt to sell toys to kids and make women say \\\"aww\\, cute.\\\" The decision to kill of Snoke was stupid and didn't make any sense. The \\\"Marry Poppins\\\" scene with Leia flying through space was cringe-worthy\\, and killing Luke at the end where Mark Hamill is still alive while keeping Leia alive where Carrie Fisher is not makes absolutely no sense either. The middle third of the movie was decent and I've give it a higher rating than the rest\\, but overall this film was a huge disappointment and I hope JJ Abrams can salvage the next one.","true":true}
