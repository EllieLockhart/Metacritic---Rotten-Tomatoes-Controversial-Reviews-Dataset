Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Going in to this movie I have read every Star Wars canon book. All of the comics. I listen to podcasts discussing the world of Star Wars daily at @forcecenterpod. This was a great Star Wars movie. I think the main thing I loved about this movie is that I can't change any of it. There may have been some I didn't like\\, but that has always been Star Wars. There was way more great than bad. What was displayed made sense. Everything they did with the force built upon the groundwork laid by Yoda and Obi-Wan. I loved the choices they made and there were some of the coolest visual and impactful scenes of the whole sage. Great movie and I can't wait to watch it 50 more times.","true":true}
