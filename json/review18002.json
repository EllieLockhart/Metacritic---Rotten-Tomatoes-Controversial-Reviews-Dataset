Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the backlash we are seeing from this movie may finally be what sours most fans to this reductive\\, uninspired and unimaginative cash grab by the Disney corporate conglomeration. I?ve always been a somewhat tepid star wars fan and after seeing this boondoggle\\, I have no desire to see any more. Apparently\\, there is a Han Solo movie coming out next year that sounds like it?s an absolute train wreck. so\\, let?s frame it like so; we just enduring this steaming pile of sh*t. Next year?s big follow up is a ham solo movie no one asked for (or cares about) that was so mismanaged\\, Disney brass had to recast the director (Ron Howard of all people ) to try and salvage what remains of this disaster movie. A year after that\\, we get to see...episode IX of this...trilogy. yay.  Who is even going to be in this movie? They basically killed everybody off.  More Rey and Ren? I think I?ll pass on all of these and you should probably do the same.","true":true}
