Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so angry at Disney for this movie. They took some of the greatest characters in cinematic history and  destroyed their essential character by making choices for them which\\, based on the original trilogy\\, these characters would never have made.  Not to mention the lazy writing and unbelievably huge plot holes they expect us as an audience to simply ignore. Easily the worst movie out of the 8\\, including the prequels\\, which is really saying something.","true":true}
