Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An appalling film which ignores established canon\\, has zero plot\\, very unfunny forced 'jokes'\\, and lashings of bad CGI characters.  It explains none of the mysteries The Force Awakens set up (another flawed film\\, but a lot better than this turkey)\\, prematurely and implausibly killing off Snoke before we find out who he is or where he came from\\, and then follows suit in bumping off Luke\\, who dies for no apparent reason at all!\\n\\nThere's a ridiculous guest appearance by a poor CGI Yoda (and where has he been hiding for all the years of Luke's isolation when he could really have used his help?).  The main 'story' (to flatter it with that undeserved description) was an insulting bad joke; a rebel ship very slowly evades capture by a pursuing Star Destroyer fleet... because all ships\\, no matter how old or new\\, travel at exactly the same speed in the Star Wars universe?  Couldn't one of the Star Destroyers simply make a hyperspace jump and appear ahead of the rebel ship and blow it to pieces?  Or are such advanced military tactics beyond the wit of The First Order?\\n\\nThe Canto Bite sub-plot was as needless as it was ridiculous\\, and looked like a deleted scene from The Phantom Menace it was so brimming with 'hilarious' feeble CGI characters and utterly unnecessary 'cute' kids.  The rebels appear to have an infinite number of smaller cannon-fodder ships which can blow up dramatically around our heroes\\, whenever some 'tension' is needed\\, although obviously\\, our heroes' ship is identical to the others\\, but conveniently impervious (and how exactly are those smaller ships able to move faster at sub-light speed than the main rebel ship or the Star Destroyers\\, which are pegged at the same speed?).  Kylo Ren remains a thoroughly unconvincing\\, whiney\\, bargain-basement Darth Vader\\, whose Force powers have inexplicably multiplied several hundred fold in the few days since Rey kicked his ass in TFA with her own equally inexplicably enormous and implausible Force abilities.  Oh\\, and Princess Leia is now Supergirl and is able to fly through the icy vacuum of space unaided\\, and without her cells exploding instantly.\\n\\nThis is a poor\\, poor film which the critics may love\\, but the fans are quite rightly hating.  It is not a fitting addition to the Star Wars franchise and I'm staggered that Disney allowed the ball to be dropped so badly on this one.  It's almost as if they were trying to infuriate and disappoint the fans as much as possible.  If this is the best Rian Johnson can come up with he should be kept well away from the franchise forever\\, not rewarded with a brand new trilogy to further insult the intelligence and irritate the hell out of fans with.","true":true}
