Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I posted a full review on my Medium blog\\, so won't go into it fully here\\, but this movie quite frankly stunk. \\n\\nI have been a Star Wars fan forever\\, and have liked every single installment thus far (with #1 and #2 being questionable of course\\, but still likeable). This movie wasn't just terrible for the Star Wars Universe\\, it was just a terrible movie overall. Viscous plot holes\\, extremely poor character dev\\, and a story that literally spanned a few days at MOST. \\n\\nMost of those that like it want to tell those of us that didn't like it that we \\\"just don't get it\\\" but that's not the case. We just don't enjoy movies that take a fantastic set up from a sequel (TFA) and throw it in the garbage. \\n\\nThis movie was a fail overall\\, but gains two stars because you should still see it and form your own opinions. Just don't hold your breath\\, the critics on here are dead wrong. \\n\\nEVEN if you enjoy it\\, there are those that want to say that this might just be the best Star Wars movie yet. Blech\\, it's hard to even write those blasphemous words.","true":true}
