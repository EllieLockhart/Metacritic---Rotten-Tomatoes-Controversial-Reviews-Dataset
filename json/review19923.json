Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was entertaining on it's own. Some parts had you on the edge of your seat. However\\, it does not fit with the original story at all. Now I won't get political and business like\\, but many factors went wrong. Bad characterization\\, useless characters\\, terrible plot holes\\, being so dissatisfying\\, etc. If you are not a huge fan of star wars\\, you will enjoy this movie. If you ARE a huge fan\\, don't expect much.","true":true}
