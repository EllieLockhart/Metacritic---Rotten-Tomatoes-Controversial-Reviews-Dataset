Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible writing and worse directing\\, stupid lame jokes and pointless side scenes. No real character development or anything\\, look at the trailer and compare to the hot garbage you pay for. This is the worst star wars movie by a galaxy....","true":true}
