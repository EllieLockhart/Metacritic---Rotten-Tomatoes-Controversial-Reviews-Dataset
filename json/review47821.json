Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where the hell is my review??\\nWhy is RT keep deleting it?! Because I said the audience score is lower than 49%?
