Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited for ever to see Luke Skywalker and I was disappointed in the movie. It shows him weak\\, useless not the jade Master. Really disappointed. 2 stars are too much for it. If you are fan of the original trilogy. Do not go","true":true}
