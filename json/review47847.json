Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start.. Beginning with a grouchy Mark Hamill just tossing away a family heirloom felt like a big screw you to the Star Wars franchise. Director Rian Johnson's approach to Luke was terrible. He is the symbol of hope in the rebellion. Jedi also find a way past barriers\/issues so it seemed quite out of character to let Rian do this to this beloved character. Luke training Rey scenes were good but the movie is just plagued by bad decisions afterwards. The characters felt quite out of place the whole time. Kylo Ren and Rey were again doing a lot of weird staring with odd pauses and looks. I get he was trying to direct confusion in those scenes but Rey is just gasping alot looking like a fish and Kylo ends up shirtless for some reason and emotionless. In total this film was just plain bad riddled with mistakes that any die hard Star Wars fan will pick up on. The director doesn't understand how the force\\, light speed and force ghosts work. Of course Disney is just accepting new things the directors bring to the table so we end up with our Star Wars Canon being expanded in a direction the fans don't like.","true":true}
