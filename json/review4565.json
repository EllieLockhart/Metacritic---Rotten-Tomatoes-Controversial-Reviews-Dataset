Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly instead of writing a good and streamlined plot it was instead decided to attempt everything at the same time. The movie introduces every single possible movie plot that was ever created and at the same time attempts to be similar to the original Star Wars movies. The resulting movie is chaotic\\, predictable and exhausting to watch.","true":true}
