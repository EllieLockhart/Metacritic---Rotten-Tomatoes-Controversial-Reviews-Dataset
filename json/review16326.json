Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im not sure why\\, but it seems a bunch of scenes were out together to make this film. It lacks a number of things\\, and I can\u2019t put my finger on it however it almost comes across as an ametuerish crafting of a film. Fans deserve more. Sorry.","true":true}
