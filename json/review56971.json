Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars made to the point where it doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. If the absurd and unusually weak title crawl in the beginning didn't warn you of the impending disaster that The Last Jedi is then surely twenty minutes into the fill the truth will slowly start to think it. The direction and editing of this movie makes the prequels look brilliant in contrast\\, I'm not sure how this got approved for the big screen. It was a major disappointment with absolutely terrible writing and very little progress happening overall. I am a huge Star Wars fan and the hype leading up to seeing the next installment in the series was astronomical. Without leaving any spoilers I'll just say that all the 'twists' that happens were just poor ways to close out the more interesting aspects that this new trilogy had going for it. I've farted and found things in my underpants more pleasant then this film.","true":true}
