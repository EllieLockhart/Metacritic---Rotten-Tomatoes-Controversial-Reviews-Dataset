Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best in the franchise. Better than 1-3\\, Rogue 1\\, and 7. Hard to compare to the original trilogy\\, but definitely sets out to move the story forward instead of retreading everything before it again like Force Awakens.\\n\\nMaybe it is a little long. It certainly feels like it could have been a bit more efficient in the first half\\, but when it gets going in the second half it lays a lead foot on the gas and doesn't let up.","true":true}
