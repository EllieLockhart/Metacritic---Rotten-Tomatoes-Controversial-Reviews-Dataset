Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke skywalker was just a farm boy thrust into an intergalactic war and after training and learning finally defeated his foes and became a hero. The female lead\\, despite no training\\, just suddenly masters the force and beats kylo Ren? Um... Wtf? It seems to me the message isn't\\, \\\"train hard\\, be a hero.\\\" The message here seems\\, \\\"young people\\, you are already better than grown men\\, you just have to wake up to it. Don't worry about training.\\\" it's destroyed a great franchise. I give it 2\/5 stars because on its own merits the cinematography is impressive\\, special effects are good\\, it at least entertains for two hours. Acting isn't great. The script feel forced and contrived\\, like they're shoving some political message down my throat. Could I write a better script? Probably not\\, but you don't have to be a master chef to know when someone is feeding you garbage. ","true":true}
