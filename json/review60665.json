Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Well. This is not the game that we all have been waiting for for several years. Yes. This is not the same chemistry in the relationship of Joel and Ellie. Yes. There are too many female characters and pregnant women. Yes. Neil from the first two hours of the game twists your eggs\\, putting them on a golf club. You go through all the stages of accepting the inevitable. You do not believe what is happening and you think that everything will work out\\, now Ellie will wake up by that very girl\\, and this is all a dream. But ... no ... Anger takes possession of you and you hate everyone who does not allow you to go further in the story. Then you start arguing that it would be better if Ally returned with her friend back to Jackson and healed happily\\, but the ghost of Joel will not let us go. This is shown in the game itself\\, but closer to the end. After you are forced to fight with Ellie herself\\, you fall into a real depression from what is happening\\, because you understand that this will lead you to sad consequences for the beloved heroine. But then ... After 30 hours of gameplay .. And re-passing\\, you understand that yes\\, there are a lot of mistakes and strange decisions\\, but hell ... what a cool ADULT it was an adventure. Thanks for playing the entire Naughty Dog team. Neil\\, don\u2019t do this anymore with the players)) And thanks to Google Translate for the translation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
