Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the movie extremely boring\\, and filled with characters that didn't led to anything. I think they could definitely do a better job with this movie\\, I am not a super big fan\\, but I have seen all og\u00f1f the star wars movies\\, this was definitely the worst.","true":true}
