Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, so very boring.  The entire movie was a very slow chase scene\\, why didn't the first order just have more ships come?  The whole plot hinged on Po not being told the plan.  Oh man I feel like PETA was involved in this movie.  And the jokes so many\\, so stupid.  Poor Luke Skywalker they did him wrong.  They made him look so pathetic to get us to like the new characters\\, I was already liking them he didn't deserve that.","true":true}
