{"101487":175210,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a mediocre film\\, but a terrible story. SPOILERS: There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the character of Luke Skywalker. In the first three films\\, Luke goes on a journey\\, against the advice of others\\, to save someone. In turn\\, this grows Luke as a character each time. In Star Wars\\, he goes to save the princess and becomes an apprentice. In Empire\\, he goes to save his friends and becomes a Jedi. In Return\\, he goes to save his father\\, thought irredeemable\\, and becomes a master. The story of Star Wars is the story of Luke Skywalker. There are more\\, and different\\, stories to be told; however\\, if you are going to tell the final story of Luke Skywalker - make sure you understand the character. This story was Disney giving the middle finger\\, perhaps out of pure ignorance\\, to everyone who loved these films. \\nI could forgive the massive plot holes. I could forgive flushing the investment Disney enticed us to make in Rey's and Snoke's backstory down the toilet. I could forgive the completely nonsensical Empire and Resistance space-chase scene. I could forgive the ridiculous Leia in space scene. I could forgive the 80s trope of of the lovable (and remarkably clean) kids\/orphans to the rescue. I can forgive that Rey is less interesting as a character now than when we first met her. \\nI can't forgive the way they treated Luke. The character deserved better. Rian Johnson has done what other missteps in Star Wars could not do - he made me stop loving these films. It's unimaginable that I see the next film. Not because this one was so bad (I've watched bad Star Wars films before). It's because they pulled the soul out of the story. When I reflected on this film\\, I realized that I just don't care anymore. It's hard to feel like part of the rebellion when all it inspires is apathy.","true":true}
