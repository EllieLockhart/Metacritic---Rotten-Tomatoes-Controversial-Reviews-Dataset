Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it! It took the familiar star wars notes and turned it into a similar but different tune. A few good surprises and some very emotional moments. Will definitely see again.","true":true}
