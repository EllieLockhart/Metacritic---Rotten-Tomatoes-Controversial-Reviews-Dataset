Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had some issues with The Force Awakens\\, but at least it had a decent story and really interesting characters. It also had a nice setup for a second movie. So of course the new guy in charge had to drop all of that for a plot that makes zero sense\\, a complete waste of interesting characters\\, humiliating the characters of color and throwing them to a meaningless subplot and make the space nazi seem sympathetic because he's just a sad little boy who didn't get enough attention from mommy and daddy (even though he's 30). As I heard someone say (I forgot who it was) it's amazing how so much stuff happens and yet pretty much nothing changes. At least the prequels had heart\\, but this? A complete and total waste of time and money. What a disappointment!","true":true}
