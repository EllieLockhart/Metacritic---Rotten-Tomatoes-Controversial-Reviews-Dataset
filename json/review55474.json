Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the movie was what I've come to expect from a Star Wars movie.  There were a couple of things I found a little hokey\\, like Leia floating back to the starship when she was blasted out.  We've never seen this side of the force before and it was a stretch seeing Leia do this.  I know that in the Timothy Zahn novels\\, Leia was studying the force under Luke's tutelage\\, but nowhere have the movies mentioned this.  Another thing that I was surprised at\\, was that Kylo Ren told Rey her parents were junkers and had abandoned her.  I think many viewers believed this statement by Kylo\\, and have voiced their disappointment that Rey's lineage was of such poor quality.  The viewers didn't seem to realize that Kylo was lying to Rey\\, playing on her feelings\\, to get her to come to the dark side. Most everything else was fantastic and we're now seeing the conflict Fin's feeling and seeing the narrow mindedness of Poe Dameron\\, with his \\\"Han Solo\\\" blast-em-all mentality.  One last part of this review is I can't forget to mention the cute porgs\\, but especially the crystal wolves.  I loved them.  I can't wait until the third movie!","true":true}
