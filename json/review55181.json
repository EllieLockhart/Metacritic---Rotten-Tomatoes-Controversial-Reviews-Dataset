Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could give 0 stars.  I tried not to listen.  I told myself that even though the prequel trilogy started off bad that it got better in the second one.  I told myself surely Rey would have some character development.  I was wrong.  This movie is just special effects and Disney pandering to I dare say Marxism.  The prequel trilogy had a real plot even if ham fisted.  George Lucas was trying to warn us about false flags and the decline of Republics due to lies and greed.  What is this movie teaching us?  That women are born perfect and never have to learn anything and that all men are bad?  That's a bad message to the children both the male and female ones.  If we teach girls that they're perfect and never have to grow then they won't.  Part of being human is to grow.  That's what the heroes journey is.  The main character is whoever learns the most by the end of the story.  Is Kylo Ren the main character??","true":true}
