Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was great if it was a stand alone and not at all involved in the Star Wars universe. but with how the creators made this film's plot\\, it wasn't a really good Star Wars movie. \\nFirst off\\, Luke would never have done something like that. He would have blamed himself\\, but he would never just turn his back on the Jedi Order that he created. \\nSecond\\, Snoke wouldn't have died that easily.","true":true}
