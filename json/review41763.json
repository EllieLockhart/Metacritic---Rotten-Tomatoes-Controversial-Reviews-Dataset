Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is pathetic\\, it's not SW anymore\\, it's a disney comedy for kids. It's all about stupid jokes\\, stupid gags\\, cute animals and cute robots doing funny things. There is absolutely no tension\\, no lore\\, no world building\\, no characters growth\\, bad guys are goofy and incompetent and the good guys are just a bunch of mary sue who got all right. After the first 5 minutes of the movie i thought i was watching a parody of SW\\, then i realized i was\\, because this is a parody. Forget about the jedis\\, the hero of this new trilogy is BB-8\\, the feminist movement and SJWs. This was so painful and cringy and frustrating and offensive to watch that i had to create an account on every possible reviews site to bash this s***\\, because f*** you disney and f*** your paid reviews!","true":true}
