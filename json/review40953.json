Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie did so much irreversible damage to the Star Wars series by essentially demolishing everything that the Original Trilogy established about The Force. There were 3 plot lines all happening at the same time\\, coupled with bad pacing and less than good acting. This movie takes no risks whatsoever\\, and chooses to play it safe. Also worth noting\\, much like The Force Awakens was to A New Hope\\, this movie is a re-hash of Empire Strikes Back. There\u2019s enjoyable moments\\, but overall it\u2019s a bad movie ","true":true}
