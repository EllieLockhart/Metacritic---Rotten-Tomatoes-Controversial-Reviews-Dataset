Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The half star is possibly too generous.  The story line did not progress\\, the script writing was horrendous\\, the film jumped from one unconnected plot point to the next with no rational way to connect all the holes.  The high rating from the critics seems to be something bought and paid for rather than earned by the film.","true":true}
