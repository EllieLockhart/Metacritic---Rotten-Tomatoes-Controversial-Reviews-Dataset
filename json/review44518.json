Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To say \\\" this is not your father's Star Wars \\\" is an understatement. The Last Jedi is a mess....it is a bloated\\, misdirected left turn change of all that you love Star Wars for.  Too many great characters are underutilized or not used at all\\, the main villain who is supposed to be this fearsome dark force badass is dispatched by a trick.  It just doesn't work......Critics can be paid to provide amazing overwhelmingly positive reviews but to have a fan base review number half that of the critics is telling.\\nDisney...Rian Johnson...you messed up !","true":true}
