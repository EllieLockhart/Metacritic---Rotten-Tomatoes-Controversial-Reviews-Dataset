{"101487":174774,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Hardcore Casuals Review Star Wars The Last Jedi.\\n\\nOh boy....where do we start? (SPOILERS AHEAD!)\\nRight at the get-go we're treated to very awkward\\, misplaced\\, and forced humor between Poe and Hux. While its successful in getting a chuckle\\, it is doubly successful in making the First Order not feel like a true threat. This is not how you want the audience feeling\\, especially after that opening crawl.\\nThe Dreadnaught scene was probably the best scene in the entire film. Very well written\\, shot and performed. We again see Poe's superior piloting skill\\, as well as\\, the Resistance's very fragile state.  The Last Bombers run was masterfully done and reminded the audience how frail The Resistance is and that every loss is a huge blow towards their efforts.\\nThe entire Finn-Rose stint on the casino planet\\, along with this underlying message of \\\"if you are rich and successful\\, you must be a bad person\\\" was unnecessary.  I cringed when Rose describes the people on that planet as the worst kind of people in the galaxy and then it cuts away to an affluent alien couple enjoying a sunset cruise. Hey Disney\\, I work retail but I've sipped champagne on a sunset cruise. Am I a bad person? Even worse\\, Finn and Rose eventually set lose Space Horses that tear apart the town. While\\, yes\\, we do see some unscrupulous and scummy characters on the Casino Planet\\, I'm certain there are some there just trying to enjoy a Vegas Style bachelor party. Do they also deserve to be trampled by space horses? The final cringe cherry on top was when Finn stated that it felt good to make them hurt a little. REALLY!!? Are you still part of the First Order or something? Hurting civilians isn't going to gain the Resistance any allies\\, buddy! \\nSpeaking of the Resistance\\, Vice Admiral Holdo might as well have been named Strong Woman like in South Park. But not the classic strong women we have seen in films of the past who are strong on their own merits\\, like Princess Leia or Ellen Ripley. No\\, Holdo has to speak down to the film's only likable character in order to show she is a \\\"strong woman\\\". She is a condescending\\, pretentious leader who is so bad at her job that she gets the crew to mutiny against her. The film tries to give her a hero's send-off by sacrificing herself in a selfless manner but I was just glad I would never have to see that character again. Also\\, that hero's death should have gone to a more deserving and established character\\, like Akbar\\, not someone who was just introduced 20 minutes prior. That's just shoddy story telling. \\nWhile we're on the topic of shoddy story telling....SNOKE! Snoke was probably the most interesting character in The Force Awakens because he was so shrouded in mystery. In the Last Jedi we get confirmation that Snoke is a powerful force user who stole wardrobe from the set of Austin Powers: Goldmember and that's it! They kill him off without any back story whatsoever. He's a Sith Lord. A master of manipulation that couldn't even tell that Kylo was about to betray him. They could have built that character into something more but they deflated him with the grace of a whoopy cushion.\\nThe Late Carrie Fisher was wonderful. It is a shame we wont see her in the next film as she did a phenomenal job. In contrast to Holdo\\, Leia is a great leader. Even when admonishing Poe\\, she does it in a loving and respectful manner with intention to get Poe to think about the consequences of his actions\\, in order for him to grow\\, the skill of a true leader. Not just speaking down to him and casting him off as an \\\"impulsive flyboy\\\". There is even a cute moment between Leia and Poe where\\, after she scolds him for just wanting to get in his cockpit and blow something up\\, a situation arises where that very action is needed and begrudgingly grants him permission to do so. The dialogue between the two is great. One really feels the chemistry between the two characters. Leia\\, a leader who truly cares for her troops and sees not only Poe's invaluable skills but also his potential to lead and Poe's undying respect\\, loyalty\\, and admiration to Leia\\, show why she embodies The Resistance.\\nOn the complete opposite side of the spectrum\\, Rey continues to be a bland\\, boring and dull Mary Sue. She's great at everything and there's no explanation as to why.  HOW RELATABLE! It reminds me of that one time I plugged into the Matrix and mastered Kung Fu! In all seriousness\\, this is really poor story telling. Look\\, I get it. Give little girls around the world someone to look up to! There's not enough of them out there. Seriously\\, I mean there's only\\, Ellen Ripley\\, Sarah Connor\\, Princess Leia\\, Mara Jade Skywalker\\, Jan Ors\\, Princess Vespa\\, Hermione Grainger\\, Dorothy Gale\\, Maria from Sound of Music\\, Sansa\\, Arya and Katlin Stark\\, Brienne of Tarth\\, Daernerys Targaryen\\, Samus Aran\\, Laura Croft\\, Princess Zelda\\, Chelle\\,  Chun-Li\\, pretty much every female character in every Final Fantasy game\\, Claire Redfield\\, Jill Valentine\\, Miranda Lawson from Mass Effect 2\\, Elizabeth Bennet\\, Holly Golightly\\, Xena Warrior Princess\\, Princess Jasmine\\, Belle\\, Merida\\, Princess Elsa\\, Mulan\\, Eleven\\, Jessica Jones\\, Clarice Starling\\, Beatrix Kiddo (The Bride)\\, Furiosa\\, Katnis Everdeen\\, Mary Poppins\\, Dana Scully\\, Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\, Batgirl\\, Supergirl\\, Powergirl\\, Wonder Woman\\, Storm\\, Jean Grey\\, She Hulk\\, Catwoman\\, Elektra.... I mean really...its slim pickings! The only difference between Rey and everyone mentioned above is that they actually did something to earn notoriety. Rey is good at everything.....just because. They even establish in this movie that she is nobody. Her parents sold her for drinking money! Some might argue that this is good\\, that means anyone can be a Jedi. Yeah\\, except you have 6 movies and tons of EU content that say otherwise. We all hate it but Jedi have medichlorians which is in your DNA which you get from your family genes. Remember Luke saying \\\"The Force runs strong in my family...\\\" Heck\\, the movie even establishes that with the Princess Leia\\, space queen scene. Rey is so dull she makes Kylo Ren more relatable and interesting\\, which leads me to...\\nKylo Ren is a boring villain. He remains a whiny brat who is supposed to be so powerful in the force but all we see him do is throw temper tantrums and scream at people. Once again we see him in combat in which he is clearly not entirely proficient and can be bested. Unlike Darth Vader who was calm and controlled and commanded respect. When he needed to punish or kill someone\\, he did it with a simple gesture\\, not a wild\\, violent and unhinged tantrum. This made Vader even scarier. He could be talking to you in a seemingly normal way while plotting to kill you. I don't find Kylo Ren scary at all. The fact that he brought down Luke's Jedi order just seems so out of character for him. Speaking of out of character...\\nLuke Skywalker has been reduced from the Jedi Master of the New Jedi order in the beloved Expanded Universe to a crazy\\, frightened old man who makes bad jokes and dies of exhaustion. Really\\, Disney? Really? I knew Mark Hamill had issues with the direction they were taking the character and now I see why. Like Snoke\\, Luke was one of the reasons I went to see this movie and boy was it unrewarding. Not only are we not even treated to the slightest acknowledgments of anything that happened in the EU (which we were told they were going to influence the new series) but we get a Luke who was\\, even if it was momentarily\\, going to murder one of his students! If anyone knows that people can be turned from the Dark Side and redeemed\\, it's Luke! So why would a little dark side thought in Kylo's mind cause Luke to try to kill him\\, and thus create Kylo Ren. Didn't Luke see what he would do? Its established that Luke is clairvoyant! He saw Han and Leia in Cloud City\\, he saw Vader turn to the light\\, he saw Palpatine's end. That's why he willingly gave himself to Vader in Return of the Jedi. He couldn't see he would create Kylo if he tried to murder him? And then there's him being so reluctant to help Rey\\, Lea and the Resistance. If anything we know that Luke always rushed to the aide of his friends. One may argue he was too scared or old\\, but this was so out of character for him. It was so disappointing to see them bring back such an iconic character only to neuter and reduce him to nothing but a McGuffin.\\nTL\/DR The Last Jedi is not a bad movie. It has its good moments and some very fun and enjoyable scenes. However\\, a long time\/hardcore Star Wars fan will be extremely let down by this movie. Apart of from just poor and lazy story telling\\, The Last Jedi completely abandons the direction the characters went in the Expanded Universe and\\, in some cases\\, completely contrary to who they are\/were in the Original Series. Disney is OK in disappointing its fan base in order to try to get new fans and sell merchandise. By the end of the film\\, the First Order and the Resistance are in the same positions they were at the beginning of the film\\, making everything in between a waste of time while losing the 2 most interesting characters in the process.\\n\\nThe Hardcore Casuals give it a 6.5 out of 10.\\nIf you enjoyed this review\\, look us up on itunes\\, googleplay or stitcher for our podcast where we go into many different topics besides film like tv\\, anime and video games.
