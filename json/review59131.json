We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let\u2019s imagine there was NO part one of this game\\, we\u2019re introduced to this new character Ellie who see\u2019s her friend Joel getting killed and then sets on this journey to seek vengeance. We play as Ellie and then as Abby.. This game would probably get 8-8.5. It\u2019s by no means a perfect game\\, but it\u2019s fun\\, not too bad of a story\\, great graphics\\, fun combat. However\\, Playing this game after the original game is definitely a disappointment. We\u2019ve already built a connection with Joel and Ellie\\, and now we see Joel getting killed and then Ellie losing everything at the end of the game AND on top of that have to play for 10 hours as the character the killed Joel and expecting us connect to her! It felt exhausting and pointless\\, I just didn\u2019t care about Abby\\, no matter how many times I interacted with the dog or played as her when she was young or went to the hospital where her father was killed! I DID NOT CARE. SHE KILLED JOEL. I played through the original game at least 5 times\\, probably 10. I finished part 2 and will never touch it again\\, that sums up the difference between the experiences we go through. Considering all of the above\\, it\u2019s still not fair to give the game a 2 or 3\\, it\u2019s clearly a well done game (mostly) and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a 6 for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
