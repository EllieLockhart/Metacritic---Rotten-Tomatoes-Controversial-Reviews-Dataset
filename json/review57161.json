Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of those movies that's like a shiny gold coin that upon closer inspection\\, and a little rubbing the glitter starts to wear off. Don't get me wrong\\, there were some great aspects. The story around Luke\\, Rey and Ben (even Snoke) had a lot of potential. But it kind of goes from terrifying to cheesy when Snoke is so easily killed off. It would have been equivalent to Luke meeting the emperor for the first time\\, and rather than having Vader kill the Emperor\\, the Emperor slips on a banana pill and falls into the abyss without any help.\\n\\nThe casino planet could have been completely left out of the film altogether\\, and replaced a discussion with someone on how to get onto the ship. \\n\\nAnd the whole slow march through space to escape the first order\\, and reach a planet everyone can see. Cheesy. Its like watching a tortoise race.\\n\\nThey really built up Finn in the first movie\\, and the plot he's apart of in this one weighs him down. And his opponent...another slip on a banana pill?\\n\\nNot sure what to make of the Leia floating in space. Reminded me a little bit of Mary Poppins without the umbrella.  It might have worked if she showed more magic tricks later in the movie\\, but nothing.\\n\\nThe best part for me was the mythology around the idea that anyone can posses the force powers\\, not just a royal family of sorts.  Of course if they carry that to far\\, and everyone can suddenly throw rocks\\, and twirl lightsabers with no training...it could get out of control in a hurry.","true":true}
