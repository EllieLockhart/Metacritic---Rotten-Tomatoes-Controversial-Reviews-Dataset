Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pale shadow of original SW. Inconsistent plot\\,  a lot of stupid gags\\, that creators must be consider as good jokes. Plus weak actors playing\\, except of Hamill\\, Fisher and Driver. \\n\\nDefinetly\\, the last of new SW movies I watched in a cinema. Never again.","true":true}
