Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is my first review\\, I usually read what other's post to get an idea. This is a new and better dimension to star wars saga. It is well acted\\, surprising\\, it keeps you on edge and a few twists leave you enable to predict the story ahead \\, unlike some of the previous ones where you know from the start who will win\\, who will fall in love etc. The effects\\, the storyline\\, the acting\\, makes it in my opinion the best star wars to date. Period . Sorry for the hard core fans who can't see that !","true":true}
