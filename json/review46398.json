Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was on the edge of my seat for the whole 2.5 hours.  Loved the writing\\, acting was acceptable\\, story line was on par.  Much more character and drama than the prequels.  People complaining about details and what fits the Lore are wasting their time with things the creators didn't care that much about.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.","true":true}
