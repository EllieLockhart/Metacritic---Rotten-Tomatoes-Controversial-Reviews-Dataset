Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though not without flaw\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an amazing addition to the Star Wars franchise. It takes risks no one was expecting. The reason it's getting so much backlash from fans is because everyone went in with speculations and theories\\, and they were disappointed when what they wanted to happen didn't happen. My only complaints would be the Finn and Rose subplot\\, and most of the jokes didn't work for me.","true":true}
