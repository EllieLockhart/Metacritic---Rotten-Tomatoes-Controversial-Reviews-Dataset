Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It didn't feel like Star Wars the first time I watched the movie. They made some critical mistakes in my opinion by not delivering on the build up of certain expectations (Luke's lightsaber\\, Snoke\\, etc.). The movie had some amazing scenes to redeem these mistakes though. Luke and a surprise appearance from a Jedi master who is very well known were handled extremely well and made the movie for me. Seeing it a second time helped me appreciate all of the nostalgic moments that it was trying to deliver on. Very powerful and emotional scenes that left me pleasantly surprised. If you're on the fence after watching it the first time like I was\\, maybe give it a second watch...it certainly changed my feelings about it.","true":true}
