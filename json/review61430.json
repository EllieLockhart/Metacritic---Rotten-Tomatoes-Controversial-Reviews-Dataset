The characters manage to be more compelling than many of the original just off of simple character motivations and what you learn from them as the story goes on\\, the gameplay is some the most crafty and intense survival combat you'll ever see thanks to the AI\\, the exploration is much more engaging and impactful thanks to the larger open areas that may have enemies you don't want to waste resources on and the simple yet efficient environmental puzzles\\, the twists and turns the story puts you through feel like something out of a coen brothers or a24 film (makes you wonder how those directors who commended kojima for death stranding would feel about tlou2)\\, the game is simply just one of the best games this gen. Compared to the first game it's got much more meat to it\\, stronger world building thanks to the different factions\\, much more believable enemies that fall less into your typical game types like the molotov guys from the first\\, the gameplay again is just improved top to bottom and above all the game gives much more naunced perspectives.  I was genuinely surprised at how much I loved this game\\, I don't like a lot of cinematic games and I'm not at all a naughty dog fan\\, I think uncharted 4 is almost as bad as 1. Really the only reason I don't give it a 10 is because I'm sure there are a few problems I missed but nothing that will fundamentally change my experience\\, I can't imagine a better sequel than the one we got for this game; for all the talk of people say for wanting games to take advantage of the medium it's a part of tlou2 does it to tell this pretty impactful story of 2 people wronged and deal with it in ways that are ultimately unhealthy to say the least.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
