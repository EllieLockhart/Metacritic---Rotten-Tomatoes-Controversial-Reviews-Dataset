Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire movie is a letdown.  Luke does not deserve the misguided writing that damages his character and makes little to no sense.  The movie has many flaws when looked at closely and is in no way consistent with the original idealogy of the Jedi's.  There is also random super powers that Jedi's now have that are inconsistent.  Will be tough for the franchise to come back after this one.","true":true}
