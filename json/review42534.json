Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an absolute train wreck. There are so many things wrong with it- but I'll try to narrow it down to 10 horrible things:\\n\\n1. Flying Iron Man Leia\\n2. Grumpy but also quickly agreeable bi polar Luke\\n3. Snoke dies during the 2nd act. It's completely anticlimactic. \\n4. Luke's character is portrayed as weak\\, Rey hoops him with a stick. He doesn't even use the force or act like a Jedi? He promise to show her\\n stuff and shows her nothing. \\n5. Holdo and Poe. What is up with that attempt at a plot twist?\\n6. Did we really have to load the film with Vegan\\,anti-male rhetoric?\\n7. Luke doesn't get emotional or \\nexcited to see Chewie or R2 and never actually sees leia or leaves the island. \\n8. Luke dies without doing anything whatsoever for no reason. He's just tired I guess. Good reason to vanish into thin air. \\n9. Kylo is suddenly the emperor? \\n10. Why is Rose even in this movie? Or Benicio? Seriously they couldn't bring back Lando or something?\\n\\nBasically this is the worst corporate attempt to stomp out the oceans bring in the new profitable regime I've ever seen. Rose got more done than Luke Skywalker. Don't waste a dime.","true":true}
