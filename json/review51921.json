Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film with a-lot of potential but ultimately disappointed. A brave attempt by writer-director Rian Johnson but unfortunately his filmmaking abilities did not match his ambition. \\nThe film does have some high points and moments that show great promise however due to the poor character development\\, huge plot holes\\, messy editing and some very weak performances - it makes it very hard to fully immerse yourself into the experience.\\nI am very confident that this is not what George Lucas would have envisioned for the final trilogy in the Skywalksr saga - and whislt I can appreciate this is no longer his franchise - I can't help feel that this film was not Star Wars.\\n....
