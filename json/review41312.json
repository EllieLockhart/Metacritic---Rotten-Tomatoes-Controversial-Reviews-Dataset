Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a giant middle finger to SW fans.  It destroys and humiliates the greatest sci-fi characters in history.  So many plot holes.  Breaks the lore of the SW universe.  What a disastrous mess.  \\n\\nRian Johnson (an arrogant disgrace iconoclast) should be ashamed of himself.  I cannot believe that he and Disney could make a movie that would make me like the original trilogy less\\, but they did the impossible.  \\n\\nI'm done with Star Wars.  RIP.","true":true}
