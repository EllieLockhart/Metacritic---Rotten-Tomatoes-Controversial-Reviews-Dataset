Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a complete mess with major plot holes already summarised and discussed by multiple YouTubers like MauLer and AngryJoeShow.\\nI've watched it 3 times in a row and it disappointed me more and more. A good movie doesn't need to be \\\"explained\\\" to be good. It just threw away all the work made by Abrams in the 7th Episode: even the shots with Luke and Rey in the island didn't matched the colours and the tone of the final scene.\\nRian Johnson (and who didn't opposed him) just killed Star Wars.","true":true}
