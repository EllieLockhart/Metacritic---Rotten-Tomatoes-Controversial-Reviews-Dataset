Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was very good in my opinion however I feel like it wasn't as good the force awakens. I feel like the force awakens was so incredible and enthralling it was the first Star Wars films in years and I think the last Jedi had a lot to compete with with the force awakens. I felt the film dragged on a bit 2 hours and a half! I just left the cinema feeling a little disappointed and deflated but I really didn't want to be because it wasn't a bad film. No spoilers but I hated this forced relationship between two characters and some bits of the film I was left saying \\\"what was that?!\\\". Not my favourite Star Wars film but not the worse in my opinion.","true":true}
