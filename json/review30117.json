Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly the prequels turned out to be better than the new trilogy under the reign of Disney. The Last Jedi tries to \\\"subvert our expectations\\\"\\, however\\, it just fails to deliver instead. The main plot is a ridiculous story of cat and mouse chase\\, while the characters are bland or just insultingly simple\\, irritating\\, pointless. The only interesting character is the newest Disney princess\\, Kylo Ren. However\\, even his character fails in growth with some focal points missing. Rian Johnson failed to deliver\\, pandered to current socio-political leftist views\\, and marvelized this iteration of Star Wars. The jokes are so out of place at times\\, I had to reconsider sitting through the movie. A significant part of the story exists just for the sake of being there - also known as filler. Said filler featuring one previously \\\"established\\\" character\\, and a new one to fill a quota. Said new character is supposedly a main character\\, yet I failed to muster up feelings or care about it.","true":true}
