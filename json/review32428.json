Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars isn't a predictable movie.  That's all it has besides special effects. This movie is drawn out and boring\\, their is so much unnecessary plot that you get lost on it. You won't but you can wait till video on this one. J.J. Abrams defiantly made a better movie. Sorry but the critics are wrong again. It's just nothing special but it will make 2 billion just on hype.","true":true}
