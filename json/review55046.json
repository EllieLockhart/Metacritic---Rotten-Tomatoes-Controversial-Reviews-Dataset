Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"I've got a bed feeling about this\\\"- the line that was missing from this star wars movie and my exact thought from the moment this movie started. It opened with a your mom joke (like why) and continued on with badly placed humor throughout the movie that more resembled the stupid humor of a guardians of the galaxy movie. What a total lack of respect to the first movie in the trilogy- Luke tossing the lightsaber\\, terrible character development on Poe\\, sexual tension between Kylo and Rey??? Almost all interesting plot lines were rapped up badly and the story overall felt very trivial and unimportant. Shame on you Rian Johnson\\, he repeatedly said he wasn't making a movie for the fans and in turn made the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. Somebody please take the next trilogy away from him. JJ Abrams save us!!","true":true}
