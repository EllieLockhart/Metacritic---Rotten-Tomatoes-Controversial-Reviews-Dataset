Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your money on this film. There's no characterization\\, everyone is flat and lifeless. The writing is terrible throughout\\, and Luke's character was totally butchered. I left the theater angry on opening night. It felt like the whole film was set up to sell you stuffed porgs and star wars t shirts. No artistry or love was put into the making of this film. Just businessmen trying to make money.","true":true}
