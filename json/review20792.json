Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie\\, but it stunk.  Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher didn't have the acting chops for their roles anymore.  I get they had to play Luke & Leia but they really held the movie back.  Rey following an emasculated and pathetic Luke Skywalker around for an hour trying to get him to join the rebellion to no avail was boring and hard to watch.  No explanation of who Snoke is\\, or how he was so easily dispatched.  Not one decent lightsaber battle between Jedi & Sith.  Then factor in all the political correctness and agendas with the film and this has to be the worst in the entire Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
