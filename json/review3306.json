Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been waiting two years for this movie.  So disappointed to see how some characters were treated and abrupt storylines.  Some people say it's nice to see a fresh take and new direction; they should have just started another trilogy.  This did not feel like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
