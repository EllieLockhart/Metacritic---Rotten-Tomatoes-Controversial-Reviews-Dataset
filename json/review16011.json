Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a hard core fan of SW. I've been going to watch the movies since Empire Strikes Back. This is by far the worst movie since episode 7. Disney buying the franchise is the worst that could happen. Plot holes every where\\, terrible acting. The director doesnt know what SW is about\\, or the mechanics of this world. Don't waste your time watching this. You\\\"ll end up regretting it and extremely pissed off. Better get a copy Truce at Bakura or Courtship of Princess Leia. You'll fall in love with SW all over again.","true":true}
