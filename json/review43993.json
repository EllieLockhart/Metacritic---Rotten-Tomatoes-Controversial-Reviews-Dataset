Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thrilling. I went in very skeptical from their bad reviews but left wondering why the heck everyone hates it. The best Star Wars since Empire and finally gives the franchise room to breathe on its own.\\n The treatment of Luke wasn't misplaced at all\\, in fact I thought it was quite logical and beautifuly tragic. Go back and watch the originals if you really remember Luke as some perfect dimigod.","true":true}
