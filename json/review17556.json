Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I simply do not understand the hate with this movie. In my opinion\\, Rian Johnson made a beautiful film with multiple themes that makes the audience think deeply\\, which is such a huge positive for me personally. Along with some of the best star wars action scenes in the history of Star Wars\\, this movie dives deep into many characters and challenges them all in such a great way! Way to go Rian Johnson!","true":true}
