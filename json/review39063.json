Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This 5 star is just to equalize one of the half star drama queens. It is an entertaining movie. A weak middle act\\, unnecessary characters\\, and pointless scenes bogged it down. really closer to a 4 star movie.","true":true}
