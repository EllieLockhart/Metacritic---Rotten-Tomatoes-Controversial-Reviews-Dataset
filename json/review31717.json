Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So So bad.  Took an already boardering on bad movie and made that worse.  Not sure why they switched directors.  What they did to all the old cast was terrible.  The new \\\"heroes\\\" just aren't interesting.  The 45 min worthless plot to save alpacas was a huge waste of time.  The fight scenes such as the throne room with snoke if you pay attention are worse than bad.  Kicks 3 guys in 1 kick\\, a enemies weapon straight disapears\\, she stops fighting a sword at her neck so she could drop her LS so she could stab the guy yet he doesn't take her head off.  It was just so bad on 500 different points.","true":true}
