Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had me gripped from beginning to end.  It took all the characters introduced in Force Awakens and gave them so much more depth as well as consistent growth throughout the movie.  Not to mention the presence of actual suspense throughout that made watching this movie a truly gripping experience.  Definitely my favorite Star Wars movie to date.","true":true}
