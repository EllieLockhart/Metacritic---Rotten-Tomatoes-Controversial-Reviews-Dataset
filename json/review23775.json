Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker would never give up on his friends or his family.. this wasn't star wars. This was stupid. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are still the worst of all the Star Wars.. but that's because they actually WERE star wars. Those films at least knew their identity and stayed true to it. I can watch the prequels and still feel as if I'm watching star wars. I've no idea what the hell these last two episodes were. They label it as star wars. They use words like the force\\, and Jedi\\, and Vader's name gets thrown around.. but I feel NOTHING. Absolutely no connection other than having to get dragged through the muck with what is this Luke Skywalker imposter. Everything is a rehash of what already came before. Nothing new is brought to the table. Kylo Ren says to hell with the Jedi and the sith but join me Rey and we'll rule the Galaxy.. yeah that's the dark side buddy. Perhaps if anybody over at Disney ever actually saw a star wars film they'd probably have a fucking clue. The Skywalker legacy is over and quite frankly star wars is over too. What a shame..","true":true}
