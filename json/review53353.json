Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some spectacular visuals and lofty concepts\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi falls short. It continues this new trilogy's trend of deconstructing iconic and beloved heroes. Legends end up feeling like your weird\\, divorced aunt and uncle\\, instead of paradigms of hope. Aside from the awful way they treated Luke Skywalker\\, there were enough plot holes to fell a Star Destroyer. (I won't mention specifics to avoid spoilers) Holdo exists soley as a plot device to generate unearned conflict and represent some sort of agenda. Finn is still underdeveloped and\\, in my opinion\\, misused as the buffoonish\\, comic relief. Here's a man\\, stolen from his family and turned into a child soldier\\, who then has a crisis of conscience. That's a lot to work with if you want to explore deeper themes but instead we got; a drunken Leprechaun\\, Mary Poppins Leia\\, a Poe\/Hux sitcom\\, soft-pilot and Admiral purple-hair. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the last movie in this trilogy that's getting my money. ","true":true}
