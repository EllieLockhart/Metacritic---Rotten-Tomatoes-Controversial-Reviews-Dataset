Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"All around this game was just hard to get through... the writing is something you'd see in some Netflix zombie series\\, the gameplay has some good improvements but over 25+ hours it gets extremely monotonous and predictable. The characters are so poorly developed and feel extremely forced\\, for example Dina and Ellie find a weed farm and decide to have sex all while Joel is about to be tortured (and that's not the only sex scene) they are extremely out of place and just cringy honestly. The developers completely forgot what made the first game so great and that was the dynamic between an extremely closed off man who's lost everything\\, and the girl that was essentially his second chance. They had some of the right ideas for tlou2 but it was executed completely wrong. I don't recommend spending the $80 for how unsatisfying and generally upsetting the game is in the end. If this is the direction they want to go with writing then movies would be the better move\\,  a game is meant to satisfy the person playing regardless of the end being sad\\, it felt like while I was playing everything I was forced to do was out of spite.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
