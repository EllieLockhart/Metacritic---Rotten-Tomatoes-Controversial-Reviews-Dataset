Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a great plot that makes you question everything. The twist are great. People just don't like it because it's different than any other star wars moveie. They're also butthurt that what they expected the movie to be wasn't what the movie was. They also have unanswered questions and are made about it\\, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER MOVIE!","true":true}
