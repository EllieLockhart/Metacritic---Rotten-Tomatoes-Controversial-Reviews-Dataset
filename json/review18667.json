Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It really pisses me off to see that basically half of these audience reviews are negative. Are you freaking kidding me? Who am I to say that you're just trying to get attention\\, but I'll say that: YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET ATTENTION. \\n\\nThis movie was amazing. It was basically the perfect action movie. I don't need to say anything more than that\\, because all any details would do would be to detract from that main point\\, and spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it.\\n\\nIf you didn't like this movie\\, you're screwed. You're never going to be stimulated by a movie ever again. Go home and watch Netlfix. I bet you're the type of people that like that movie \\\"Bright.\\\"","true":true}
