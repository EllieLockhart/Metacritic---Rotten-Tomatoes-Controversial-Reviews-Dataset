Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is actually the first Star Wars movie that made me feel like never want to watch it again\\, after leaving the cinema. Terrible\\, terrible plot\\, filled with nonsenses that defy your intelligence. Maybe that\u00b4s what Star Wars has developed into\\, but that is not good. Not good at all.","true":true}
