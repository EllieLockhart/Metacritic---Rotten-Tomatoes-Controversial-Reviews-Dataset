Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess I'm just an ignorant film goer who doesn't understand the last jedi\\, and that it is a brilliant piece of art. Ryan Johnson likes a lot of really good classic films and has good taste in samurai movies. In no way can his enjoyment and study of those films make this newest Star Wars film a stinker. Last Jedi is bold in pushing Star Wars into more complex\\, nuanced territories that'll really challenge the casual movie goer. It's so funny. Every joke is intentionally placed\\, as to not undermine the dramatic performances by the charismatic Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Isaacs\\, and Adam Driver. Gone is the tongue and cheek sarcasm\\, which may upset the 40 year old fans of the franchise. Speaking of the 40 year old fans\\, screw em'\\, am I right? Every fan of the OT is so blind that they're pretty much incapable of seeing that Star Wars is no longer that first trilogy. As Luke says in TLJ\\, \\\"it's so much bigger\\\". So\\, if a fan tells you that a Star Wars film is a disappointment\\, then that actually means the film is worthy of time\/praise. The Last Jedi\\, in humor\\, content\\, and structure\\, is a complement to the YouTube generation of filmgoers and sets the course for new and exciting storytelling.\\n\\n;-)","true":true}
