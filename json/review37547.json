Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a big difference between \\\"not making a movie for the fans\\\" and \\\"making a movie against the fans\\\".\\nRian Johnson made a movie which is literally a big slap in the face of everyone who knows about Star Wars.\\nAnd he reacted to the backlash saying that the fans do not have the right to say they didn't like the movie\\, and if they do that\\, they are morons with a stick in their asses or right-wing fanboys.","true":true}
