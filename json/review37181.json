Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing Star Wars fans hate more than other Star Wars fans is Star Wars. I liked this film more than FA. Could have used more gratuitous visuals and graphics shots but overall another fun\\, awesome installment to everyone\u2019s favorite space series.","true":true}
