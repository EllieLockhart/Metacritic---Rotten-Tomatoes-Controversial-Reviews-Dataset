Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am writing my opinion for the last Jedi because I keep seeing all these stupid star wars commercials while watching football and every time I see them I say movie sucked so this is my opinion for Star Wars the Last Jedi  The Last Jedi sucked!!!! Besides one action scene I hated everything about it. Was bored and annoyed throughout it. Audience including me had little to no reaction throughout the movie. There was barely any laughs at the parts that supposed to be funny. At the end of the movie one person started to clap but stopped suddenly realizing that no one was clapping with him or her and a woman in front of me as I walked out turned to her friend and said at least someone liked the movie which made laugh more than the movie did.","true":true}
