Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\"\\nYea its a piece of shit. Didn't see that coming. Overly long\\, a lot of pointless subplots and characters\\, and the one liners were the worst! Not a worthy successor to the force awakens and I wasn't even in love with that film.","true":true}
