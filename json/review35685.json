Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a richly detailed movie. At 152 minutes (Theatrical Cut) it's also along one\\, but it needs that time to pull together a veritable basket-weaver's handful of plot threads. Thankfully that running time never becomes an issue\\, because for almost the entirety of the showing\\, the eyes of our audience were glued to the screen. \\n  Disney recently made the seemingly odd decision to throw their weight behind director Rian Johnson and declare he'd be parenting a new (non-Skywalker) Star Wars trilogy. Having seen The Last Jedi\\, that confidence finally makes sense. \\n  Johnson's movie races past with the flair of J.J. Abrams but fewer lens-flares and flashy tricks. The deeper interest in characters and the wider galaxy that we found in 'Empire'. The story isn't afraid to introduce new heroes and villains\\, and to assume our familiarity with what's gone before. \\nWill you miss out if you see it without watching 'Force Awakens'? Yes. Like 'Empire'\\, theoretically you can watch it by itself\\, but it'll make a great deal more sense if you know the context. \\n  I won't go into plot details because there's much to enjoy in the way the story is played out\\, including several nicely handled surprises. \\n  I can say that Carrie Fisher's final role is far more layered and interesting than her turn in 'Force Awakens' (and has a poignancy granted by her passing)\\, her daughter Billie Lourd fits the series like a glove\\, and Hamill never fits into the predictable 'mentor' role\\, keeping things challenging and unexpected. \\n  Isaac's 'Cameron Poe' develops enjoyably beyond his 'flyboy' role into a more rounded\\, more rebellious character. 'Rey' grows in every way - her emotions\\, skills and Force powers all advancing\\, while she remains the emotional anchor of the new series alongside Boyega's 'Finn'\\, who remains the heart. His character is always hugely enjoyable to watch and gets a few truly standout moments. \\n  Nicely\\, everybody gets their share of the pie in terms of great writing; Snoke manipulates with considerable evil\\, Hux drips unctuous zealot glee in his attempts to destroy the Rebellion\\, and Adam Driver's character of 'Kylo Ren' develops and grows in exciting new ways. \\n  It's not all about the characters of course; we get exciting new weaponry and ships\\, an interstellar gambling capital\\, new aliens\\, and new creatures\\, of which some odd Jedi caretakers and the adorable penguin-like Porgs are big successes. \\n  The film is also riddled with beautifully judged comedy that punctures any pomposity in just the right way\\, and leavens the tone between some genuinely dark and threatening moments. \\nThe visuals are terrific\\, the storyline labyrinthine and devious\\, and the scenes endlessly varied in location and tone. In all\\, you'd be forgiven for thinking Johnson had 'managed a Kershner' and created a sequel worthy of the Empire Strikes Back. \\nYou'd be forgiven\\, because you'd be right. \\n  Pacy\\, exciting\\, filled with action and character in equal measure\\, it's a rich experience that\\, like Nolan's films 'The Dark Knight' and 'Inception' will make for a welcome second viewing so your brain can absorb all the things you didn't have chance to register the first time. \\nIt may be The Last Jedi\\, but it's one of the best.","true":true}
