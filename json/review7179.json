Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyed this movie.  The series is really starting to develop the new characters but allowing the old characters to shine and in fact as with Luke\\, did an awesome exit.  The movie has humor\\, adventure\\, drama\\, and suspense everything we as fans of the original trilogy wanted from the prequels.  Only thing I am not liking is the wait for the next chapter.","true":true}
