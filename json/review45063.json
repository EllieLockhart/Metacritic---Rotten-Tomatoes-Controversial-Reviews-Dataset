Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Undeniably a tour-de-force\\, the Last Jedi has a lot to take in\\, with it being clear that there were lots of ideas\\, characters and story lines to cram into this middle movie. Ultimately the movie is crafted excellently and shows the strength of Rian Johnson who directs and films this with amazing flare\\, intensity and skill. The film does tribute to its returning characters brilliantly\\, with Mark Hamill standing out and thankfully gets given a complex and fitting story. New cast members such as Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran do well\\, while Adam Driver really proves his acting ability against others well. This is one area where the film falters\\, Daisy Ridley's theatrical performance often does not fit and some lines and scenes come off as very cheesy and reminiscent of material in the prequels\\, while Oscar Issac seems to spend much of the film running around; stressed out. The story is tense and thrilling\\, but there is so much of it\\, even the most dedicated fans will feel exasperated especially when there's a clear stopping point for the movie\\, with it instead deciding to push on. That being said the action\\, especially the space scenes and a particular lightsaber fight are all incredible. The film brings about fantastic emotion and dialogue between our more historic characters and Rian spins the plot completely\\, resolving many mysteries that are bound to annoy some fans but for the sake of stupidity is probably best off the way it is done. How the franchise continues and ends is now an even bigger mystery...","true":true}
