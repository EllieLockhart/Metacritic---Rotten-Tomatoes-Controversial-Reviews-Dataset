Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was 5 star and the filming was amazing but I could not feel satisfied with how they portrayed Luke's character. He is the hero of the original films and I wanted so much to see more of him and more action! Don't kill him! I walked away from the film confused.","true":true}
