Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things wrong with this film. It starts with failure to follow the basics of film making and story telling\\, such as telling a story that makes sense and isn\u2019t boring. Too long and dull\\, full of contrivances\\, and constantly ripping off scenes from episodes 4-6. Poe commits mutiny??? And everyone is OK with that???","true":true}
