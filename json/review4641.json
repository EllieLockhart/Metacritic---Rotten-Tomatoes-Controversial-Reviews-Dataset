{"101487":113525,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Compared to the 2nd generation of Star Wars movies Produced by George Lucas...this one at least has some humor and a story line\\, albeit an hour too long and waaay to much mystical force nonsense. Half the movie seems to be an elaborate setup for the next movie...and of course the \\\"Last Jedi\\\" isn't either the last jedi or the last movie about the last jedi.","true":true}
