{"101487":113916,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Confusion. That's the only way I could start off this review. I had left the theater with my friend\\, another long time starwars fan and despite him still having a smile on his face... I looked as though I'd seen a car accident. \\n\\nThe movie when it worked\\, worked well.... the problem was that it did not work well often. Do not read ahead if you have not seen the movie. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint with this movie was the characters. The way some of them interacted\\, the lack of accomplishment or emotion some of them seemed... or even the fact that there is more plot armor than any other movie at play in this one. \\n\\nThe Poe scene with Hux\\, the can you hear me now scene\\, brought a forced laugh almost because it felt so out of place. How can you make General Hux such a bumbling idiot but still have him best the rebellion at every turn? \\n\\nYou have Poe who\\, through out the movie grows from wanting to be a character that wants to blow something up to\\, someone that wants to blow something up but a little later. His character seems to have grown the most in the movie\\, which may seem strange due to the movie taking place over two days. Poe also has no regret or even any sympathy at the countless rebel soldiers that die in several of his Fire fights. In space he's the reason for countless deaths\\, in the rebel base he leads an attack which should have just been the rebellion asking who wanted to be culled... but of course Poe makes it back each time. He's the only pilot that can be chased by defense lasers\\, the fighters\\, and not have a gun and still come out on top. There's no fear that we will lose him which is laughable due to the fact we were supposed to lose him in episode 7 but he was written in as staying due to how awesome he actor is. \\n\\nFinn\\, he's still the fight or flight\\, or flight\\, or flight again character. It's hard to love a character that has been trained to be anything but a coward\\, and instead is one. Even his moments of nobility\\, the series takes away from him. In Episode 7 he survives an attack from Kylo Ren\\, fine\\, you can have one... in Episode 8 he not only survives a fight against Phasma and the potential executioners\\, but in the Death Star battering ram (as stupid as it sounds) scene when he goes to sacrifice himself... they take that away from him as well. Finn would have been the talk of the rebellion\\, the guy who saved the base from being cracked open. Instead\\, he's the guy that Rose\\, a character I won't even give her own paragraph to\\, says something along the lines of... we'll stop the war by fighting for love. Not the exact quote but something along those lines... these two apparently fall in love in a scene that\\, wastes twenty minutes of the movie and feels the most out of place. You could have taken the Canto Bight\\, or however its spelt\\, scene out of the movie and not have lost a single moment. You could have shown a scene of them leaving the ship to grab the hacker\\, then show them flying back with him. \\n\\nRey... and Kylo. Let's put them in the same paragraph because most of the movie is spent with them feeling for one another and having long distant Force FaceTime calls despite being a galaxy away. This is a brand new ability that\\, I for one think it took away from the movie. Rey and Kylo have several talks\\, and Rey has even more moments through out the movie where it appears she can be taken to the dark side. I'll sum it up like this\\, Kylo still has good in him. Rey has darkness. Neither of them change sides though. There's an epic fight scene on Snokes ship where Rey comes to see Kylo in hopes of him defecting... instead they kill Snoke\\, kill his guards\\, them the two break up... Kylo goes on to control the First Order\\, Rey goes off to the rebel base where Leia and the rest fled to. Oh\\, and Rey's parents are nobodies. They're just drunks who dropped their daughter off as a kid for money. It negates the \\\"what girl\\\" scenes from the previous movies. Are you mad it was explained that way? That's exactly how it comes up in the movie. Kylo says to her\\, \\\"I know who your parents are. They're nobodies. You're nobody. They're drunks who sold you for money.\\\" And then he tells her she's somebody to him and they should rule together. Rian Johnson should have had the two go off together\\, have both of them give up their ideals at the moment and just escape. Instead\\, more of the same...\\n\\nSnoke\\, as mentioned\\, he's dead. His praetorian guard\\, they're dead but the fight scene was awesome. It is one of the only fight scenes in the movie and\\, that was well worth watching for. \\n\\nPhasma\\, she gets wasted as an opportunity again. The fight scene you saw in the commercials? That's the same one in the movie. She cannot defeat Finns plot armor. \\n\\nLeia\\, is a beloved character and Carrie Fisher will be missed... they had the perfect opportunity to have taken her character out in the movie. Kylo and two tie fighters are lighting up the ship that she's on... the scene in the commercial where he debates clicking the button\\, that's the scene. He doesn't fire but his ties do\\, taking out the entire deck and killing long standing characters such as Raditz and launching Leia into space. Leia however has the biggest plot armor of all however\\, as she uses the force to fly back into the damaged ship\\, and can be kept alive long enough for them to put her on a life support system. \\n\\nThere's many more characters but\\, the one I am most disappointed by is Luke. Luke\\, you find out that he's the reason Kylo is who he is... he debated killing Kylo\\, and of course was fount out by Kylo as he\\, Luke\\, stood above him with his light saber brandished. Luke was going to kill Kylo in his sleep. Luke seems to have taken the largest character change over time... as he is the grumpy old man who hates the force and wants to be left alone... on an island of lizard nun caretakers\\, giant sea manatees with large breasts for milking\\, and porgs. When Rey gives him the light saber\\, he looks at it and throws it over his shoulder. He refers to them as laser swords. He consistently seems like an angry old man and confirms that Rey is powerful\\, has darkness in her\\, and that's it... There is a scene with force ghost Yoda where\\, Yoda seems drunk and they insult the Jedi text that Luke is about to burn down... but here's a bigger let down. Luke never physically leaves the island. They hint at his x Wing being under the waves but\\, it turns out he could use a force ghost while alive\\, project himself half a galaxy away and hold off the first order and Kylo long enough for the rebels to escape. There's a single touching scene with Luke and Leia before he disappears\\, where we find out he was a force ghost. Luke then dies. Luke never physically leaves the island. Luke dies. They kill Luke in the movie. \\n\\nFinally\\, the movie ends with a single boy that we saw on the gambling town that wasn't needed\\, and he uses the force to grab a broom. We needed a twenty five minute gambling scene to set up another scene to set up that there are other force users in the galaxy? No. Kylo is in charge of the First Order\\, Rey and Leia\\, and Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose and the eighteen surviving Rebels are on the falcon with an army of Porgs. Snoke is dead\\, Luke is dead. Phasma better be dead or else they'll waste her in yet a third movie. The movie overall was a let down\\, it felt disrespectful to the characters we've grown to love in previous movies.... it didn't feel like there was any accomplishment in this movie other than Snoke dying.... but then again Luke died so\\, there we go...","true":true}
