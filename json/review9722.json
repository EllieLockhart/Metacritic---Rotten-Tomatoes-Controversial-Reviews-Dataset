Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Star Wars movie\\, still a lot of filler with no need whatsoever\\, as it did not affect the main story. In doing so it could bring the movie down to about 1 hour 40 minutes. Also I was sad with some changes into this or that character\\, completely changing the soul of the person. Mark said it best when he said \\\"he's not my Luke Skywalker\\\". Still\\, more a whole more plot compared to the Force Awakens. Disney is changing SW but not for the better\\, just to make more money.","true":true}
