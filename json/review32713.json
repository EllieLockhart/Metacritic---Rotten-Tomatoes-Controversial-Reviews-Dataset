Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi may have suffered a few flaws like the Finn & Rose storyline which dragged the movie for me\\, but it did had most good elements from its predecessor (The Force Awakens). It had characters you care for\\, action sequences to entertain you\\, special effects to make you go in awe and the amount of twists and turns that were unexpected. With all of that being said\\, this was the best Star Wars sequel I have seen since The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
