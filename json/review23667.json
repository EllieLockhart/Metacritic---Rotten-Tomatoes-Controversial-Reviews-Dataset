Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lowest of the low.  It's as if they pulled some homeless people off the streets to write the story \\, some SJW direct it\\, and chimpanzee's performed the editing.  Another childhood franchise ruined.  This just proves CRITICS CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!  Oh\\, if you do see this movie please let other people know what YOU thought of it.  Just say you've been warned.\\n\\nIf you're still reading this and still confused why people hate this\\, then just go to Youtube and search for \\\" Smack Talk: The Last Jedi \\\" and it should spell it out to you.  And if you still don't get it then look up \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi: An Unbridled Rage\\\" by MauLer on Youtube\\, where he does an excellent job of breaking it down.","true":true}
