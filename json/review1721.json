Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a singular film\\, The Last Jedi works well. It is a personal\\, emotional character drama. As a main story entry in the Star Wars mythos\\, it is very underwhelming. In the end\\, we're left with more questions then we had at the start; and the answers we do get are disappointing.","true":true}
