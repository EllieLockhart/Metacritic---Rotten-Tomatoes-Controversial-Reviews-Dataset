Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, this really sucked. Way to completely destroy what the Star Wars Universe had built. Looks like Phantom Menace is no longer the worst Star Wars movie. I had my complaints about The Force Awakens but at least it was a fun and enjoyable movie with iconic moments. This was just a piece of garbage.","true":true}
