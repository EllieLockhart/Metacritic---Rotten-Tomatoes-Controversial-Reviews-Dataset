Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The prequels are no longer the worst movies in the Star Wars Universe. Luke Skywalker's character is demolished and is now just a sad old man. The subplot with Finn and Rose is completely useless and wastes our time. Leia is now superman and the rules of the Force and Space no longer apply. Kylo Ren is an unsatisfying villain and Snoke is killed off in the most ridiculous way. Not to mention the move is just a copy of the prequels almost as much as The Force Awakens. The film has several continuity issues\\, plot holes\\, and characters not acting like they were in the previously film\\, mainly Poe. As if all this weren't enough\\, new characters like Admiral Holdo and Rose are uninteresting and annoying and lower our favorability towards the new characters introduced. The injection of politics into a Star Wars movies is never wanted and a once beloved franchise is now ruined in favor of a political ideology and world view. The movie looks and sounds good but does not make up for the slap in the face to Star Wars fans.","true":true}
