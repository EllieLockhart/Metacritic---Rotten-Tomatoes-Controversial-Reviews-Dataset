Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is definitely ambitious.....just in the wrong ways. This movie failed to make any of the villains a serious threat if not ignored or killed off. The casino planet was a complete waste of time and Del Toro's character completely useless. I like some of the stuff with Luke. Luke fighting the false perception the galaxy has of him. Hate the saber throw and hate the fact he was killed off in the second film.","true":true}
