Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've changed my mind after having more time to think about it as well as take in other points of view and I can't argue against the dislikes as they are all true. \\n\\nThis movie has killed Star Wars. Thank You SJWs.","true":true}
