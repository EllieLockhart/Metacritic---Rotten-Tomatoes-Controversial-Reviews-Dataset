{"101487":170387,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an incredible film. Not only did it have a beautiful score and stunning visuals\\, but it also had an interesting plot.\\nThe acting was pretty descent. Humour was okay. There was a few laughs here and there. Heroes were heroic and the villains were evil\\, which is a good thing in my opinion. The plot twists made the movie heaps more exciting to watch. \\nTo a person who has watched the previous Star Wars films\\, it would be a good movie\\, but to a person who hasn't\\, it would be excellent. It was a fun\\, exciting and emotional movie to watch\\, but it had some flaws.\\nThe film staisfyed a variey of viewers in a variey of ways by adding\\, bringing back and killing off many characters. The only people the film didnt satisfy were Luke Skywalker fans. \\nThis film ruined Luke's character. They misused him in so many ways.\\nAlso\\, there was some unanswered questions in this film. For example\\, who were Rey's parents? Where did Snoke come from?\\nAnother big flaw was the mission that Finn and Rose went on. It was completely useless and utterly boring. It was not needed in the film.\\nMy last flaw is Kylo Ren's outfit. As much as I enjoyed the scenes of him in this film\\, his outfit was very poorly designed. They should've kept it Darth Vader inspired. \\nIn conclusion\\, I really enjoyed this film. It was fun\\, exciting\\, interesting\\, emotional and overall and amazing film.","true":true}
