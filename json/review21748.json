Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"just awful\\, breaks all the old characters and makes them look selfish or bitter or just goofy. and the new characters is either a mary sue or a space janitor that effectively adds nothing of consequence to anything. no seriously anything he tries to do to help doesnt help\\, he ends up getting captured and gets busted out by movie magic\\, like a code breaker being in the cell next door\\, or a ship going into hyper space as he is about to get killed. but honestly these movies are a huge let down\\, to see there was absolutely no plan whatsoever with this franchise reallly shocks me with how well the marvel universe has been managed.","true":true}
