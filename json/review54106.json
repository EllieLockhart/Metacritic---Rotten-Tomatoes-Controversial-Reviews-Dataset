Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself. I keep saying they'll get better\\, it'll be alright\\, just give it a chance. Then as I sat through this film\\, constantly looking  at my watch to see if it was over yet\\, I realized that there was no hope left in the galaxy. From the cliche one liners to the unbearable puns\\, which in my opinion ruined the movie\\, this film was mediocre at best. The characters had little development and terrible chemistry\\, the plot had mild build up despite the looming danger of the films hero's\\, politics (Actual\\, not the far far away kind and needn't I have to say more)\\, out of place romance\\, I could go on and on. This totaled to be a two and a half hour film that ended with more questions than answers. When the film ended all I thought to myself was what did I just watch. It felt as though the people who were in charge of developing the new Star Wars series decided that there was no way they could continue to build on the story from episode XII\\, so they decided to tie up loose ends. On top of that this was just another cookie cutter Disney bundled film. Now I'm not going to give any spoilers\\, but if you've seen the movies Frozen or The Lion King\\, you'll recognize some of those plots in this film. My only hope is that George Lucas will get his hands really dirty in the coming Star Wars films because in the hands of Disney Star Wars will continue to take a nasty turn to the dark side. Reasons for why I went to this one in theaters over the other two is beyond me\\, but I will stick with Redbox for the next Star Wars films to come.","true":true}
