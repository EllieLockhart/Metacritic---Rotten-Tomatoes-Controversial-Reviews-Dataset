Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A well written and well acted movie\\, I felt they killed off Snoke too early\\, and the pacing perhaps could have used a bit more work but its a great addition to the franchise. The patorean guard fight scene is absolutely amazing. \\n\\nPeople complaining should grow up and realize they wont get the same feeling you did when you first saw the original trilogy. Plain and simple.","true":true}
