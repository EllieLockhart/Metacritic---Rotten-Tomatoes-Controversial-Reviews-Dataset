The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I know people are disappointed about this game\\, but i also kind of feel like those same people are missing the point.\r\rFirst and foremost\\, Joel's death is hard to swallow\\, but arguing that it doesn't fit in with the character or the world is dead wrong.  Joel has spent four years in relative safety\\, and he is journeying with his more optimistic and trusting brother Tommy when he is killed.  He has made a home within a community\\, he himself has become more trusting\\, and the world building makes it clear that\\, while on patrols\\, there are encounters with other survivors who are given shelter.  Joel makes a split decision to trust somebody instead of fighting an entire horde of infected\\, which is understandable in this world.\r\rThis act of violence serves as the impetus for the rest of the story\\, which is in my opinion masterfully told.  You play as Ellie\\, but also for a large portion of the game as Joel's murderer.  Other reviewers are finding this problematic\\, but the story itself is truly two parts of a whole.  Ellie becomes more withdrawn and distant through the course of her majority playthrough\\, and your thought is that it's due to her hollowness as a result of her revenge play.  But\\, after you spend time with Abby\\, the situation becomes more clear.  The vengeance has taken a toll on Ellie\\, to be sure.  But she is also starting to empathize with Joel's killer\\, leaving her conflicted.\r\rHalfway through playing as Abby\\, I began to realize that it is absolutely not a stretch for Joel to be such a villain in Abby's mind.  This story fits with the world\\, and the way Ellie reacts to such a situation is absolutely to honor Joel's memory.\r\rObviously\\, i love this game.  i understand some of the criticism as well\\, but i really think this game needs an open mind.  Everyone needs to take a step back and approach this piece of art with the right perspective:\r\ra) Naughty Dog doesn't owe you anything.\rb) This world is\\, and always has been unforgiving and life hangs by a thread.\rc) There is a very valid opinion that Joel gets what he deserves\\, particularly from Abby's perspective.\rd) Calling something \\\"bad writing\\\" just because you disagree with a plot point is not only childish\\, it's just wrong.\r\r10\/10\\, this game is better than the original and actually enhances the themes and morality present in Part 1.  I'll be playing new game + multiple times.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
