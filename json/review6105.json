{"101487":116229,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney and Rion Johnson did something Vader and the Emperor could never do and that was destroy Luke and Leia Skywalker \\n\\nThe Series is destroyed\\, I wont be watching the next movie.\\nFirst time I walked away from a Star Wars Movie Saying Meh!?\\n\\nSPOILERS! SPOILERS!  SPOILERS! \\n\\n***********I Literally Created An Account To Express My Distaste For This Film\\, Only Film I Felt I Needed To Do This With*********\\n\\nI was able to see The Last Jedi the day it came out.\\nI was excited\\, anxious\\, and really looking forward to it; I just finished up re-watching all of the Star Wars movies and finished with the Force Awakens. While many had issues with the Force Awakens\\, I was much less critical and could understand both points of view but overall I believe it was a solid movie. So needless to say I was really looking forward to seeing the last Jedi......Unfortunately the movie was a mess\\, poorly written\\, and it was all over the place. All in all the movie fell flat on its face and i couldn't help but walked away thinking\\, what the the world did I just watch\\, where the heck did the spark go and what in the world was the company thinking when they approved this garbage!? \\n\\nAll honesty I don't even know where to begin\\, I'll just touch base on a few different things that just made me upset\\, confused\\, and just flat out depressed.\\n\\n*******Exact Copy Of Return Of The Jedi & The Empire Strikes Back.*******\\nWhile The Force Awakens was a rehash of a New Hope\\, it was easily forgiven because it just felt right. \\n- The Last Jedi right off the bat does not feel like a Star Wars movie at all but it literally takes the foundation of two of the previous movies and brings them into this movie but the problem is it doesn't have that spark or magic\\n- It was essentially a really awful version of Return Of The Jedi; In Return of the Jedi\\, Luke senses good in Vader and then volunteers hands himself over to Darth Vader. From There Vader begins to speak with Luke  and essentially says its too late for me and the emperor will show you the ways of the darkside blah blah blah; That entire scene happens in this movie except replace Rei with Luke and Kylo with Vader. They even have the same exact elevator sequence to reach the Emperor \/ Snoke.\\n- In Return of the Jedi; Luke is brought to the emperor and Luke essentially says I was the one who planned this\\, I leaked the location of the Death Star and The Shield Generator to your rebel friends and they will find that this base is fully operational. In The Last Jedi THE SAME EXACT DIALOG is said from Snoke! He explains to Rei\\, it was I who planned this\\, I bridged the connection between you and Kylo\\, your resistance friends are lost\\, we can shoot them from here blah blah blah. The Same exact dialog was said here.\\n- Then in Return of the Jedi\\, Luke is getting his but kicked by the Emperor; Vader then does a triple take between looking at his Son Luke and the Emperor then decided to kill him. Rei is in the same exact situation and Kylo does a triple take between Snoke and Rei then decided to kill Snoke in the lamest way in cinema history. \\n- You want the battle of Hoth\\, they have it they stole literally all of the scenes from it with the walkers\\, the sense of helplessness\\, even to the point where the Rebels....sorry i mean Resistance had to leave.\\n- Same exact plot from Empire; \\\"Yoda doesn't want to train Luke\\, Luke says he wont fail him\\, senses a evil presence on the planet' Boom! \\\"Luke doesn't want to train Rei\\, Rei says she wont fail him\\, she feels a dark presence on the planet.\\\"\\n- Come on lazy lazy writing.\\n\\n**********Ruined Luke and Leia Skywalker ************\\n- I read a number of the books that were extended and many of the books that were now cannon. I've gotta say\\, they ruin and I mean ruined! Luke Skywalker. The moment he takes his fathers light saber and throws it away was just devastating. It felt like a SNL Skit and from that moment I felt very very concerned.\\n- How does Luke Skywalker a Jedi Master all in 40+ years lose in a fight against a girl who has all of 36+ hours of training\\, really? I'm sorry that wouldn't happen.\\n- I understand what they were going for\\, a broken Luke and I was fine with that\\, but I never felt or understood why his reasons for being a recluse. It was poorly explained and when they tried to redeem him at the end it felt very wishy washy. It didn't have heart or soul\\, it felt shoe horned in with no real purpose. \\n- Leia.....Leia.....Leia...Leia. How in the world did you become superman? That was one of the most awkward sequences I've ever seen in Cinema\\, I understood what they were going for but it just came across stupid.  \\n\\nI'm done for now.\\nI'll create a new real review sometime later.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before I understood what they were going for and I really thought long and hard about it but at the end of the day it was so poorly written\\, poorly executed\\, and he was a mess of a film. \\nThis is just a few elements i did not like from the movie.","true":true}
