Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This isn't going to go the way you think\\\" Luke said. And he's right. And the result is -- rather than a story that \\\"rhymes\\\" so much we don't get anything new\\, we got familiar settings with completely different circumstances. To me\\, Star Wars has been life at times. You know what doesn't go the way you think? Life. RIan did really well.","true":true}
