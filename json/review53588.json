Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie! This is far better than I expected. Don't let the 'fans' tell you otherwise. I've been watching Star Wars since 1977 and can say without a doubt that this is the best movie of the bunch. Outstanding acting combined with actual character development (Thank you George for letting someone else run your universe) and of course the visual effects we've all come to expect from Star Wars. The twists and turns were absolutely amazing. This movie felt like it was made to really refresh the franchise and get things moving forward. I can't wait for the next installment!","true":true}
