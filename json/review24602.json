Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie looks amazing. But the faults are overwhelming.\\nFirstly\\, the hope from a NEW HOPE is now nothing but a disgusting green milk slurrying man with no hope. Ryan destroyed Luke's character. Secondly\\, there was this hype over who Rey's parents are\\, he destroyed that too. The Casino planet is pure crap and that entire arc has no purpose and is stupid. Another thing\\, why does she not just tell us what her plans are? It's a stupid reason and she isn't a hero\\, she is a pathetic example of the worst leader the rebels ever had. What the heck is up with Leia Poppins' fly scene? Phasma is under used and the only reason she is popular is because I knew who was under the armour. The Skywalker saga that's been building for 7 movies\\, suddenly destroyed by the worst writing I have ever seen. Episode 1 is gold compared to this rubbish. Hated the movie.","true":true}
