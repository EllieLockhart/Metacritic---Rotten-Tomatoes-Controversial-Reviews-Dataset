Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ANYONE WHO RATES THIS MOVIE MORE THAN HALF A STAR IS EITHER PAID BY DISNEY EITHER A TOTAL IDIOT AND NEED TO SERIOUSLY REFLECT ON HIS OWN INTELECT..... \\n\\nTHIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE\\, DISNEY BOUGHT THE FRANCHISE BUT CANNOT BUY OUR HEARTS\\, WHY THE HELL DISNY WOULD  DO THIS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLES HEARTS THIS IS A MYSTERY\\, A BETTER STORY WOULD HAVE MAKE MORE MONEY ANYWAY\\, RIAN JOHNSON AND KATHLEEN KENNEDY ARE THE SUMMUM OF BAD TAST......WHAT A FAILURE THIS MOVIE IS...I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE OF MY FAMILLY HAS JUST DIED--- FUCK U DISNEY AND FUCK U RIAN JOHNSON","true":true}
