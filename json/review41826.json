Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so poorly written it make the prequels look like shakespeare.  This movie is terrible for countless reasons .  Bad in every single way other than looks .  The story is politically charged and super badly written . Plot holes with every new frame of film . This movie leaves you feeling empty and  feeling ripped off for spending money on such terrible storytelling ! BAD MOVIE ~!!","true":true}
