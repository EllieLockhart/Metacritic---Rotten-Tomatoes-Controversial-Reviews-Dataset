Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing turn out of Luke Skywalker. Lots of inconsequential side missions going on. Also\\, major story questions regarding the background of main characters gets squashed. Not the great Star Wars experience I expected\\, but it was not a bad movie in and of itself. ","true":true}
