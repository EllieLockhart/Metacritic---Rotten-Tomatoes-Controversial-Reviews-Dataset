Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It boggles my mind that anyone can find this movie entertaining.  It's a bad movie in general\\, and an absolutely horrible Star Wars film.  Illogical plot and characters\\, inane dialogue\\, an almost petulant disrespect for the saga it is supposed to be working towards concluding.  A few ideas that could have been interesting\\, but the flopped comedic attempts\\, wasted character interactions\\, and frightfully dumb plot arcs (among other things) propel this movie straight into the waste bin.","true":true}
