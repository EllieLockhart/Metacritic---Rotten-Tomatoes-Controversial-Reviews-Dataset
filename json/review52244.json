Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A \\\"Funny or Die\\\" fan film full of flat characters and uninteresting and inconsequential subplots that throws away 40 years of myth-making\\, character building\\, and audience goodwill. The first Star Wars film in 20 years that I'll not be seeing multiple times in the theater\\, The Last Jedi was also the first Star Wars film that had me checking my watch to see when I could get up and go home. From the first scene (which turns a serious character into a ridiculous buffoon) to the last (which inexplicably dismisses another)\\, the movie jokes and jars its way along for two-and-a-half painful hours until it finally and abruptly ends\\, leaving most questions raised by The Force Awakens not only unanswered\\, but entirely and completely unaddressed. A real disappointment.","true":true}
