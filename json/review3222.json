Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautifully shot and highly entertaining. The Last Jedi takes risks with the mythology of the Jedi and attempts to avoid the standard plot tropes of previous Star Wars films\\, almost to a flaw. I was never bored and was genuinely surprised in many moments. I can see why there is some backlash among the fans because many of the twists almost seem to thumb a nose at the internet theories that have been thrown around for the past couple of years after The Force Awakens. I\u2019m giving this movie 4 stars because it was entertaining and I can respect the risks taken here. I just hope they payoff in episode IX. I think the audience score would have been higher if they would have given some fan service to the plot elements from the previous films that make Star Wars films so fascinating.","true":true}
