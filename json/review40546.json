Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst attempt at a plot I have ever seen in a science fiction or fantasy film. The plot holes are impossible to ignore\\, there is little character development\\, the Ahch-To scenes are as disappointing as it gets\\, the slow chase scene in space that lasts the entire movie\\, the jarring transition from ep 7 where all of the sudden the Resistance has almost no forces and the First Order forces have inexplicably increased\\, the hyperspace weaponization problem\\, the misplaced humor\\, the tone\\, I have no desire to keep going\\, there are so many things wrong with this movies. It's like Rian \\nJohnson had an outline and knew where he wanted characters to be during certain scenes and simply didn't know how to get them there in any kind of believable fashion.","true":true}
