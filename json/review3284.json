Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a fan since opening night in 1977. Luke has always been my favorite character of all time. I've waited since 1983 to see him on the big screen again. Got excited for The Force Awakens and was majorly let down when he didn't even speak a line. Then we get The Last Jedi and again\\, I was excited to see Luke on the big scree. It was worth it!! Luke was FANTASTIC!! However\\, that all got wiped away in the end. There was so much more he could have contributed. I have no desire to see Episode 9 now. I will never forgive Disney for what they've done to Luke\\, and Star Wars.","true":true}
