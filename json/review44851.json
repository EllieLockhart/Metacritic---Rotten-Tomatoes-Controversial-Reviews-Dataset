Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Try clicking on the Users of any 4+ star rating and tell me they aren't fake accounts.  Most of them don't even link to a profile.  The movie was horrible and RT should be ashamed for allowing the kind of paid shilling that is going on in user reviews.  They bought a 94% rating and anyone who doesn't see that is blind.  I hope RT made a lot of money off this deal\\, because you won't be getting any more site visits from me.  Sell outs.","true":true}
