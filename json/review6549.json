Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does not honor the past as it passes the torch.  Finn and Poe are unlikable in this episode.  Many scenes are unnecessary or too long.  This is a bad movie and after watching this I cannot believe they are giving the director another three films.  I will not be suckered into a ticket purchase for episode 9.  It was a bad movie.","true":true}
