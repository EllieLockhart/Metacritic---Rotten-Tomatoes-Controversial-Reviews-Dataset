We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A beautiful and tragic tale of what revenge and grieve does to people\\, I guess that would be the best way to describe it.\r\rOn the technical side\\, is god damn masterpiece. Animation\\, environment art\\, character art\\, design and more. TLOU2 is the result of the most amazing artists\\, designers and programmers working in the industry right now\\, the best way to the end the PS4 era.\r\rOn the story. *sigh* Here we go: I loved it. It made me angry\\, made me feel lust for revenge\\, made me happy\\, sad and much more. It was an emotional rollercoaster that made me stay on the edge of my seat the entire time.\rIt is by no means a \\\"happy ending\\\" game which it what is making people angry! You love Joel and Ellie\\, you want them to succeed\\, to survive\\, to win\\, they are the protagonist after all.  But ND showed us that this world is NOT like Uncharted. At the end of the day is a sad story and that is why is so beautiful\\, is not about \\\"who wins\\\"\\, is about the characters and they nailed that. My appreciation for Joel and Ellie just wen through the roof and the way they handled the relationship between those two was really good.  Also: TOMMY IS A BADASS\r\rNot all is gold of course. My biggest issues are pacing in gameplay and in the storytelling:\rIn gameplay:n it feels anything when you have played and upgraded Ellie for so much\\, to suddenly change to Abby and start all over again\\, no upgrades whatsoever. It feels a big stop to momentum.\r\rIn storytelling: Abby's relationship with her father is not explored AT ALL which makes no sense to me since that would have been a better way for us as players to connect with her and feel MORE her obsession with revenge as well. All we got was a cliche flashback where the guy saves a zebra\\,  kinda lie the game telling you \\\"look\\, he is a very good guy\\, feel bad for him and Abby!\\\"\\, is not enough ND\\, it just isn't.\r\rLast but not least: the game is very long\\, like almost 30 hours or so\\, and the gameplay stops evolving at some point which makes the last part of the game feel repetitive\\, but not boring thou thanks to some great level design that does make every encounter feel almost unique.\r\rFinal words: don't give in to the hate. Buy it\\, is an amazing experience that and an awesome game. Also: probably a great game is you need to relieve stress!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
