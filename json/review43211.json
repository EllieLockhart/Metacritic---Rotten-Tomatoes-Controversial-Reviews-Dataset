Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie absolutely destroyed Star wars as a golden goose which most thought would be impossible to damage yet they certainly did it proving that nothing is impossible. Rey basically destroyed all of the interest in working hard and training to be the best apparently there was no need for Luke to train his butt off with Obi Wan\\, and yoda. All that is needed to become a Jedi master above all is grow up female as a scavenger and have the name of Rey and suddenly you too can go from zero Jedi ability to being a master that can destroy all including Luke.\\n\\nIt's like Star wars is no longer about great star wars storylines and instead is about political leftist brainwashing all into becoming Marxist\\, pedo's \\, and Robot diddlers.","true":true}
