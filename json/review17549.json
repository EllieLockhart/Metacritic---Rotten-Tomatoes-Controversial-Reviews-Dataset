Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up to make this review because I can't for the life of me understand the audience score for this movie.  I grew up loving Star Wars.  I thought Rogue One was a great and The Force Awakens was a good movie.  I am not a fanboy who just loves everything with the Star Wars name slapped on it but this movie is better than OK.  It is a good movie just on the merit of the movie.  Subtract the franchize\\, and the fact that this movie was clearly made by someone who loves Star Wars it stands as a good movie.  There were times I could tell I was being emotionally manipulated but despite seeing the path I was being lead down I enjoyed the ride.   The movie was a fun and exciting ride.  I can see how it may not be what people expected but that doesn't make it a bad movie.  I have looked at the bad reviews and I am not sure we saw the same movie.  Maybe this is a love it or hate it kind of movie but for me I loved it.  There were minor issues I had with the movie but nothing that ruined the fun of the movie.","true":true}
