Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars as a franchise has been ruined by the heads of Lucasfilm and this movie shows for it. All the old characters are turned into meaningless nobodies that they want to get rid of anyway. The social justice perversion that is this film shouldve never been made.","true":true}
