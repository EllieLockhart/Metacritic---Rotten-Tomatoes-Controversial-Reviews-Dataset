Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were many things wrong with the movie\\, but it mainly comes down to a bad story. This installment may have killed the trilogy. The main issue is that the bad guys\/force are not scary at all. They are either having emotional swings or the butt end of jokes. This is not the Empire of old.","true":true}
