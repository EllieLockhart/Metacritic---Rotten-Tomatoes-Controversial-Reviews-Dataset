Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow...what has happened to Star Wars. So much wrong in this movie I can't even imagine how long it would take me to write it all out. After watching the Last Jedi I think it's time for me to put Star Wars away. ","true":true}
