Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has some plot holes and it isn\u2019t flawless\\, but the direction it takes and the twists make it unpredictable and a very enjoyable experience. It won\u2019t please everyone\\, but it definitely makes me excited to see the conclusion of this trilogy. ","true":true}
