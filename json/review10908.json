Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hated what they did to luke skywalker could hardly recognise him cos rian changed him so much and other than that the film just wasn't fun or exciting and didn't feel like a star wars film i suppose the plot was ok ish just for the majority of the film has most of the cast inside a resistance ship and no one is really doing anything exciting. terrible film\\, worst of the saga\\, wouldn't recommend!","true":true}
