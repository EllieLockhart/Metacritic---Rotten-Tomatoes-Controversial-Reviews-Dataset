Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars for the cinematography only.  The plot was so bad... so very very bad.  Heres a better plot I just thought of as I was typing this\\, instead of a chase scene resembling two turtles chasing each other\\, why not have the rebels be captured by the imperials.  Finn and whats her face can then do something useful and help break the rebeles free.  Then they can escape the fleet using escape pods or stolen shuttles to the old rebel base.  Wow... is it that hard Disney?","true":true}
