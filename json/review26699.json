{"101487":159134,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, since I did not put my review yet\\, and I see some people blindly upvoting this piece of thrash  in what seems like an attempt to save this movie's reputation\\, here it is. What are the elements of a good movie? A great storyline\\, one that makes you constantly wonder what will happen next. A story that you don't want to tell your friends abou before they see the movie because you don't want to spoil the exitement. THE LAST JEDI has NONE of that.It is inconsistent with the previous movie\\, full of plot holes\\, and pointless long scenes that brings nothing to the main story. Also there is the obvious SJW agenda forced down your throat\\, shallow\\, uninteresting\\, stupid characters that fills the checklist - Strong Women - check! Ethnic Diversity - check! Stupid men - check! Cheap cheesy jokes that even my kids do not find funny - check! Get rid of the characters that fan love and make sure they don't steal the show from the new ones - check! \\nLet's wrap it up\\, THE LAST JEDI is the worst starwars movie ever made\\, Rian Johnson should not be allowed to touch anything from this franchise ever again\\, The SOLO movie is suffering from Rian Johnson's crap\\, and so will all future starwars movies if Disney don't fire him.\\nIf you want to keep good memories of Starwars and have'nt seen THE LAST JEDI yet...for god's sake\\, don't watch it\\, it can't be unwatched afterwards\\, and it will kill your interest in the franchise.","true":true}
