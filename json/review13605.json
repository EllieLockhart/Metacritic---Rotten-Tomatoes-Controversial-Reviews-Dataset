Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt numb and emotionally dead through most of this film. Afterwards I felt gutted. \\nI love the first 2 Star Wars films. I really enjoyed The Force Awakens and Rogue One and it looked as if things were really looking after 3 an a half decades. But this? It left me cold and disappointed and with the feeling that Star Wars-as ongoing 'saga' films-is finished.\\nI don't know how JJ will pick up the pieces of this one\\, and make the next.\\nWhat a mess.","true":true}
