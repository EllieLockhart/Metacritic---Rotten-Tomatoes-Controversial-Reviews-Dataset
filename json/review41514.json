Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is better than the predecessor\\, as it breaths life into new characters and challenges the status quo of Star Wars films. It was better the second time\\, as my own expectations limited my ability to enjoy the film the first time. Another great installment to the franchise!","true":true}
