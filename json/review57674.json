Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trim the fat to this movie and there's little meat to enjoy.  Solid hour and a half wasted on poorly written comedy and meaningless subplots.  All of your questions from TFA are answered in the most disappointing ways.  This movie tosses out 40 years of solid cannon and almost acts as if the TFA never happened.  I was so excited for this movie only to be left wondering how it ever left the edit floor in such a poor state.","true":true}
