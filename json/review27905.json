Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Piss poor writing\\, idiotic plot holes and needless asinine fluff to pad out the movie\\, Star Wars\\, the Last Jedi seems to have been constructed as a bunch of semi-cool scenes that needed to be tied around a story rather then a good story that is tied around decent scenes.    It's not worth your time\\, and will suck the soul of the casual and intense star war fan all the same.","true":true}
