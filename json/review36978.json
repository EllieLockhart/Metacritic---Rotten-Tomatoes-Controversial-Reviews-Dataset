Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was pretty much a series of very unlikely or stupid actions\/events\/logic that panned out which made the plot boring.\\nLacked a lot of originality in many places. \\nToo much attention to characters no one cares about. \\nMovie had a difficult time keeping track of the number of people who die and are still alive. \\n\\nVisuals were great. \\n\\nProbably the worst Star Wars since Phantom Menace.","true":true}
