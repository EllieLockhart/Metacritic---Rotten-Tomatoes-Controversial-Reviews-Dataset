Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a good movie. Yes there was some plot holes\\, but not that bad of a movie. I like how Star Wars is going in a different direction. Not sure why all the hate towards the movie. Acting was good\\, story was interesting and it leaves room for new adventures in the next movie. ","true":true}
