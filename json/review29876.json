Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rose and fins subplot was lack luster with obvious plot holes like how did the stuttering buffoon DJ even know where the resistance fleet even was and how the hell does bb8 know how to commandeer an ATST ??????? Lea\u2019s portrayal of force powers is a cgi mess \\, and Yoda looked wonky along with not enough time in every scene to let the movie breath needed ( long sweeping transitions between scenes like with ALL other Star Wars movies The rest of the movie was amazing especially when Luke used the force to project himself across the galaxy Rey\\, Kylo Dynamic was on point ","true":true}
