Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Killing of Luke was such a shocking event. The Luke in this film was not the Luke Skywalker\\, Jedi Master we've come to love and admire. Think I'm done with Star Wars. Some change is good but to bring down a beloved franchise for the sake of change. Just wrong.","true":true}
