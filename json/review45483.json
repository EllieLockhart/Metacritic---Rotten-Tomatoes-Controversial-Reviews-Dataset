Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in the movie. Rian Johnson did a terrible job. I hope J.J. can fix the steaming pile of crap he was left with. This was my least favorite Star Wars film. There was no real plot; it was filled with 5 second cheap laughs. The only reason I gave this two stars is because there are three scenes in the entire film that are true Star Wars and not this load of crap Disney is turning it into.","true":true}
