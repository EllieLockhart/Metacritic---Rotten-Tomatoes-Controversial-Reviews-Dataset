Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, could the critics be any more paid off or scared of Disney?! Any other movie and the critics would be ripping it as a horrible piece of dung. I\u2019m so sick of movies where the story is the good guy just running away the whole time\\, in the same setting no less. Luke\u2019s character makes no sense in any way or shape. Finn is a character you shouldn\u2019t even like in any way or shape. Anyone with Jedi Power seems to have some kind of anime character like power up when they are down and out\\, case in point Leia. The super villain is toothless and wears a Hugh Hefner robe\\, actually I\u2019m convinced it was Hugh (rip). There was literally one visually stunning scene\\, it took place in space\\, you\u2019ll know it when you see it because it\u2019s the only one. Oh and right off the bat I was put off because of the hokey dialog between Poe and Hux. I actually cringed at the childish humor they put into that and other scenes. I feel bad for anyone that was waiting with high hopes to go to this travesty. ","true":true}
