Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars the last jedi was a visually a buffet for my eyes. The contrast of colors and the special effects won me over. Plot wise the movie was good. A few scenes that I could have gone without because I felt they distracted from the overall plot. Its a shame to see Gwendoline Christie's character (Captain Phasma) so underutilized in terms of her great acting. Overall the movie was amazing and it just gets better after the 3rd time.","true":true}
