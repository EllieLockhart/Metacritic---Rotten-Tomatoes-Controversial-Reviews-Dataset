Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This chapter is like the force -balanced between the good and the bad. While avoiding spoilers -because this movie has them in spades- this is easily the best directed of the Star Wars movies with some spectacular shots\\, uses of silence and color. And yet  poorly plotted and written. Every time Kylo\\, Rey\\, or Luke or on the screen the movie soars. And every time Poe or Finn take the stage it crashes. Ultimately\\, it's a really frustrating movie because there are so many great moments and ideas and concepts and yet has so many clunkers that keep it from reaching it's full potential.","true":true}
