Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an excellent daring film! Fans aren't happy with the same old\\, but also aren't happy when they take bold risks! The Last Jedi has immaculate storytelling and wonderful visuals. An excellent Star Wars film that I'm sure will only get better with time!","true":true}
