Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"there were some nerdgasmic moments but the main plot with the  Leia's ship was boring finn's side quest was entertaining but didn't contribute much snoke underwhelming it's better than the prequel trilogy if your a star wars fan go see it matinee but don't buy it on home release","true":true}
