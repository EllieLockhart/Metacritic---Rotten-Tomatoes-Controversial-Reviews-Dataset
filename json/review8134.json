Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic gripping film that keeps you engaged the entire time. I even went into it thinking I would genuinely hate the porgs... because seriously.. do we really need to add them to the film just so Disney can sell more plush toys to kids? I can admit when I was wrong\\, they definitely add to the overall experience in a positive way. Great writing\\, and a great cast. Overall worth every dollar\\, and worth every moment of my life I have to watch it. I'm quite sure to watch it again.","true":true}
