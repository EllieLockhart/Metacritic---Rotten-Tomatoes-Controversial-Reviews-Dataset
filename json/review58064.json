Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. The Family loved it. When my wife\\, young son (9)\\, older son (25) and I all enjoy a SW movie\\, you know they nailed it. My wife was not impressed with the last one.\\n\\n2. Lots of humor - much more than I was expecting.\\n\\n3. Kudos to Rian Johnson. Not afraid to make big changes while respecting the original characters and material.\\n\\n3. Shocking moments\\, one within just the first few minutes. Delivering more than shock value\\, they help drive the story. You'll see.\\n\\n4. Heroic moments. And a very special one for me personally... which I won't talk about right now because spoiler.\\n\\n5. A contender for BEST of the series. Better than The Force Awakens\\, which I liked but didn't love. IMHO The Empire Strikes Back still retains the title.","true":true}
