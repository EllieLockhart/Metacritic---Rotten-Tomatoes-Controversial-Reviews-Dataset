Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie in the saga and a massive spit in the face of fans. How could this happen after the great beginning that Abrams brought us.. How could they do this to Luke.. and to us?  Star Wars Wars always supposed to make us happy and hopeful.. not angry\\, torn and frustrated! Omg!!!","true":true}
