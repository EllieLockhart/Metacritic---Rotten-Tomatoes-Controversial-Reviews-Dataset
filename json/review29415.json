Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson does not understand Star Wars. He has his script completed before ever seeing Force Awakens. He is on record to have written The Last Jedi with only JJ's completed script of the Force Awakens. He made many bad choices in this film. He should stick to independent projects as he doesn't respect the work of those who paved the way before him.","true":true}
