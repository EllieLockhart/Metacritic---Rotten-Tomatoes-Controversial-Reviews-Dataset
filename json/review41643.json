Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is incredible! Don\u2019t believe all the reviews that want to pretend that they could have made it better. This movie fired on all cylinders the entire way through. The story was great and the acting was phenomenal. I cannot wait to see it again!!!","true":true}
