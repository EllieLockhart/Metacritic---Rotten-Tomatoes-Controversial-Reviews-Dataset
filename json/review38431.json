Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the worst piece of garbage i have ever paid to see. i will no longer be watching any future star wars movies as long as kathleen kennedy and ruin johnson are attached. i cannot even put to words how bad this movie was or how pissed it made me. amateur filth. you have to have donkey brains to enjoy this trash. i hope ruin johnson dies before he can make his own stupid trilogy. i give it zero stars. i only give it one star on this rating system so my rating appears in the average. half stars dont count\\, cause if they did\\, the user score would be around 24%.","true":true}
