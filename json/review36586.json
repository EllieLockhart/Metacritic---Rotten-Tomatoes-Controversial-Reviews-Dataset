Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has just a handful of nice battle scenes\\, In the force awakens the main  purpose was to find Luke \\, This ner order was powerful and the only hope was to find Luke .so is perfectly reasonable that you expect to see a all powerful jedi master tosing around the at-at's and showing why he is what he is ans in the meantime training Rey...but what you see her is another bad interpretation of what the fans want\\, the Director doesn't have the slightest idea of what the real Star Wars fans where waiting. Is a total disaster!","true":true}
