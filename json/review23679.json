Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luck has no fight scene only a projection where he does nothing and dies. There is no light to light saber fights in the whole movie\\, just a fight with the Snoke\u2019s guards. And that wasn\u2019t much of a lightsaber to lightsaber fight. It was lightsaber vs guards with they\u2019re own type of lame weapons. Leia flies and looks pretty lame. The entire movie the First Order is chasing the Resistance till they run out of fuel. JJ did a much better job with The Force Awakens. ","true":true}
