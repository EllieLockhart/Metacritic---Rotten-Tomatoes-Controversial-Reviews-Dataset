Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i have never been less interested in a star wars movie as episode 9. this movie basically destroyed everything the force awakens builds up. on the plus side tho\\, the prequels are a lot more watchable now.","true":true}
