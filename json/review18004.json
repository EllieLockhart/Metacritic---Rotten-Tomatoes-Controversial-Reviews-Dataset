Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i THINK THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE\\, IRONICALLY IS A SPRINKLE COVERED TURD. aDMITTEDLY IT HAS NICE CGI but that doesn't mean that it's not an AMORPHOUS\\, brown\\, sloppy pile of goo made from digested husk of what was a deliciously rich franchise.","true":true}
