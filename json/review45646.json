Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very easy on the eyes\\, Very hard on the soul... This movie is a spectacle of modern cinema. Very beautifully done by Rian Johnson.  But what this movie sacrifices is way to much to be overlooked by its beautiful cinematography.  Sub plots run amuck\\, sub plots from the first film were dropped or completely irrelevant\\, Lack Luster love interests (misplaced and poorly timed I might add)\\,   The needless killing off of already interesting established characters to add new characters who are incredibly useless.  The writers absolutely botched this one. Sure for anyone looking for a good time then this film is for you. I recommend at least seeing it once. But for those Star Wars Fanboy fanatics and lore junkies such as myself\\, this one is a kick below the belt.  Hopefully you pull off some miracle with the next movie.","true":true}
