The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I see a lot of people in metacritics complaining about the game's history\\, how horrible it is and its the worst ending of all videogame industry. honestly I loved the game\\, I love how you get upset with Abby in the beginning for killing the joel\\, but you start to sympathize with her during the game because even if they don\u2019t accept\\, she had her reasons for doing what she did\\, not only with her but with her friends also mainly with Alice (the dog) when you play with Ellie and you go to the Aquarium I remember that I killed that dog and I didn't have any remorse for it but later on I was very sad when I went there with Abby and I realized that it was Alice that I had killed.At first I believed that ellie was right with her mission but every time I progressed in the story I start to see that it wasn\u00b4t doing her well because she didn\u00b4t care about anything expect her and her mission\\, she didn't care about Tommy\\, Jesse\\, and even Dina\\, she left Dina and her son to go look for Abby\\, we see throughout history how selfish Ellie is \\, and I think in the end she realizes that when she is playing guitar in the empty house. But in summary I think people didn\u00b4t like the game because it didn't end like they wanted\\, they wanted a happy ending but this game is not about that\\, its about explaining to a person that in revenge nobody is right or wrong\\, revenge will not bring you comfort or happiness\\, only more sadness and destruction and i loved the last fight you see ellie completely insane trying to kill Abby and when she is about to do it she has a quick flashback of joel playing guitar and she lets her go\\, you later see that this scene that she remembered was the scene that Ellie forgives joel for what he did and this is such a strong scene that I admit\\, I cried a lot\\, Ellie being able to forgive Abby for what she did its really sad but good \\, she has to live with the consequences of her actions but now she can live in peace . remember its easier to suffer than to forgive \\, Yes i give this game a 10\/10\r\rThanks for reading and have a nice day\u2026 Expand","true":true}
