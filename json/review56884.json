Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a lot to digest after watching it the first time so I needed time to process and watch it again before sharing. The story was filled with twists\/turns and went places that I didn\u0092t think it would go. At least not till Episode 9. But I think the film is absolutely brilliant in so many ways! There were parts of the film that I questioned and little things here and there that one could nit pick about. But unlike The Force Awakens the writer\/director has opened the franchise up to new possibilities while sustaining the integrity of what came before. My favorite element of the film had to do with Luke Skywalker and what was done with his story arc. The wisdom bestowed in certain scenes really spoke to my heart and is reflective to where I am at with life.\\n\\nThere where a few questions that were not answered that I hope that JJ Abrams does in Episode 9. I would personally rate this film a 9.5 and am excited to see what Rian Johnson does in the new Star Wars trilogy that Lucas Films gave him to write! I know a lot of people are not feeling The Last Jedi\\, but I find that it takes time for great art to grow on you. What Rian Johnson did was original and out of the box. He could had played it safe and produced a regurgitated piece of shit (like most Hollywood Blockbusters)\\, but he didn\u0092t. He followed his heart and created something truly special. If you are a fan of the franchise and are not feeling TLJ\\, I urge you to watch it a few more times\u0085 it will grow on you. May The Force Be With Us <3","true":true}
