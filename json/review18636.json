Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It only gets a half star because the actors did their job but the writers and director were out to lunch. Literally the worst drawn out pointless plot I have ever witnessed in a movie history. Too many wtf moments to count. ","true":true}
