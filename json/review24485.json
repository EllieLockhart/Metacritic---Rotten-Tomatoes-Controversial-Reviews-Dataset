Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most disappointing SW film ever made. Luke Skywalker is made into a coward and weak.  Rian Johnson made a plot hole mess of this movie. Finn and rose with a awkward forced romance and got many people killed. Nothing learned about snoke. Apparently PETA made this film by saving space horses\\, but not freeing the slaves who were taking care of them?? No knights of ren. Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson should be ashamed of themselves!","true":true}
