Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is far better than people on here are giving it credit for.  It is spread a little to thin in spots and had a little too many storylines happening. But worthy of much more than 1 star.","true":true}
