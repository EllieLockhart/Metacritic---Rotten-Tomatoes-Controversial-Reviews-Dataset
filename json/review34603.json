Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The casino\/horse racing planet must be one of the laziest pieces of science fiction cinema I've ever seen. Star Wars has a rich history and precedence when it comes to gambling and Rian threw that away in exchange for a thinly veiled Monte Carlo reference. Feel like this is applicable to the whole film. Very lazy story telling and poor dialogue. Star Wars fans are very used to using their imaginations but this film took the piss.","true":true}
