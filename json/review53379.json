Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dropping bombs in space? Gravity? Too much comedy\\, too much social issues like empowering woman\\, slave children\\, animal cruelty and the 1% have no place in Star Wars. Do a documentary about those issue but don't use Star Wars. Finn and Rose adventure was pointless\\, boring and useless\\, so the Holdo and Poe fights. Just tell Poe the plan like Leia did and he agre\\, waste of time. Leia Superman\/Mary Poppin moment was a disgrace and a joke. Killing Snoke wasn't bold just stupid and made his character pointless. Adding force powers that contradict the otherd movies is just wrong. Skype and hologram wasn't need it. Chewie and Phasma didn't even had anytime. The Knights of Ren? Rey parents no one? So she was powerful 'cause the light match the dark. I guess Yoda was stealing money 'cause those younglings didn't classes to become Jedi.","true":true}
