Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One was A LOT\\, I mean A LOT\\, better than this movie. It was too long\\, had too many subplots. Luke Skywalker's character was totally unlikeable\\, which I think is disappointing to any fan and the heir to Darth Vaders character was confused\\, weak\\, and stupid. Way to much princess Leah. The whole thing was confused and long. I am being generous giving it 2 stars.","true":true}
