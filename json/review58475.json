{"101487":101450,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people gave The Force Awakens flack for essentially remixing A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi should not be given a pass for it's debatable more original plot. Setting the movie immediately after The Force Awakens did not do The Last Jedi any favors\\, with the driving conflict of the story coming out of no where. Did the destruction of Starkiller base have no effect on the First Order? Seems like it\\, as they now have fancy tracking technology and seem to be as in just as good shape as in TFA. In retrospect making the actions and sacrifices in the last movie feel meaningless or for nothing sets a good tone for how the rest of the Last Jedi plays out. This movie seems to reveal in hopelessness and it's own cynicism\\, showing the actions of our heroes to be ultimately meaningless and futile as death and destruction is dragged out over a 1 and a half hour movie that some how was dragged out for another hour. Most of the characters seem out of character for the sake of the movies 'jokes'. This movie feels like a tonal disconnect from all the other star wars movies. All the characters are sidelined for a really weird story telling choice on focusing on Kylo Ren\\, in a unneeded story line that repeats and prolongs what was already covered in TFA. While the characters of color are technically given the same amount of screen time as everyone else\\, their plot lines could be cut from the movie and it would remain relatively unchanged. Worryingly the plan that Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rose spend the movie trying to achieve\\, is shown not only to fail\\, but also to have been meaningless and ends up getting a lot of people killed that wouldn't have happened if they had just listened to the nice white lady who wouldn't tell them what was going on. In the end the film seems like a very long filler movie\\, that ultimately only serves as a depressing tone deaf dredge that adds nothing of value to the overall Star Wars story.","true":true}
