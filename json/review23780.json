Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke's personality rewrite: atrocious. The main characters are forgettable. The military tactics are both inconsistent with previous movies and just ridiculously bad. Watching this movie convinced me that their entire cast of writers need to be fired\\, and that Disney has neither understanding nor appreciation for the star wars franchise. Lucas screwed up with bad writing and poor acting on the prequels\\, but they doubled down on the worst of his mistakes and added on too many more to count.","true":true}
