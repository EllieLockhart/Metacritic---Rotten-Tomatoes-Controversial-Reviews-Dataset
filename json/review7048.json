Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Eek ok so this movie was \u201cdecent\u201d but honestly it felt more like a Disney movie than a Star Wars movie. It made me upset to see a movie apart of one of the best franchises of all time be NOTHING like the others. There were so many parts that just left the audience confused and many anticlimactic scenes. If you are not a hardcore Star Wars fan but a fan of cheesy gags and cute animals\\, this would be perfect for you. But if you live and breathe Star Wars like myself\\, I would pass seeing this movie.","true":true}
