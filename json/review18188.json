Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was incredibly intense and entertaining. It was a great way to transition the audience from focusing on our heroes of the past to the new new hope. The battles were climactic and exciting\\, it answered a few questions but left us wanting more. There will definitely be a lot of hype for the 9th episode.","true":true}
