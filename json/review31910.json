Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"spoiler free Don't go in with any of your own theories\\, you will be disappointed. This movie takes the saga in a whole new direction\\, and in my mind\\, is filled with surprises. This is the Star Wars movie you are looking for.","true":true}
