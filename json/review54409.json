Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know some people are going to hate this\\, but it's my opinion and they're welcome to disagree. This was purely an average movie. And this is disappointing because it had the potential of being so much more. First off\\, I'm not a whiney fanboy who misses the original trilogy (although I am a huge fan). I personally am OK with the new character arcs in this movie\\, my concerns are over the mechanics of this movie. In my opinion\\, the movie misses the mark in overall tone\\, a purely written plot\\, silly and often misplaced humor\\, and some wasted characters. The movie is OK\\, and does the job\\, but with a few changes\\, it could have been one of the great Star Wars movies. I'm concerned over what Rian Johnson will do with a new trilogy.","true":true}
