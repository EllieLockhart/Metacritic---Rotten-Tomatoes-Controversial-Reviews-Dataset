Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\" -Luke Skywalker describes The Last Jedi.\\n\\nI think this was a great movie.  To avoid spoilers\\, I'll leave it at that.  See it in theaters\\, it is worth it.","true":true}
