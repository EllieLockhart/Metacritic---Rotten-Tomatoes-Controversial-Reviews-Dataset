Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved that that is movie broke the mold for a Star Wars movie. I am a big fan of the franchise\\, and I read the books and comics too.  I think that Rian Johnson told the story he wanted to tell\\, and I am a fan of it. I have seen the movie three times. The second time was most enjoyable -- after I had been relieved of my expectations going into the first viewing. The third time around I saw many of the flaws people have pointed out in other reviews. What I like:  The movie does something unique and puts all of the main characters through some kind of failure. The movie is about failure and also turns the typical hero trope on its ear.  While during the arc of the film we see several characters learn from their mistakes\\, every major character experiences failure at some point during the movie. Failure might make the trip to Canto Bight seem like a waste of screen time. But the ultimate failure of Finn and Rose's mission and what they learned was kind of the point. Certainly\\, the Resistance fails in a massive way by the end of the film.  I love this unique theme for a film. It is not a perfect movie. But I have no problem with how it treated Luke\\, Snoke\\, etc. Better than Rogue One. Not as good as Force Awakens. But a great new direction for the franchise.","true":true}
