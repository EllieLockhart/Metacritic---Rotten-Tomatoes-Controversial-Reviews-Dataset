Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tells a very bad story. Let me explain... I grew up with the first trilogy and it taught me so much. I learned to stick to my sense of being good instead of giving into hate and evil. This movie has none of that sense of honesty or vulnerability. It seems fabricated by Disney to cram as much things into 2 hours to try to sell toys without making any effort into telling a story. There is no depth to this. Everything happens in what seems like 24 hours. It is so weird. And also they way the women talk to men always putting them down. I don't get it. Where is the sense of adventure and truth that the original trilogy had? Why are all the men dumb? It's a sad state of film making and Rian Johnson should never have made this movie.","true":true}
