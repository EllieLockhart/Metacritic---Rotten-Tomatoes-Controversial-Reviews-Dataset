Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly writen\\, not a fanboy feeling like i didn't get what i wanted\\, the movie bored me with flickers of interest then quashed with a totally misfitting scene\/storyline. Critics love the film as they see it as a brave new way to tell a star wars story\\, but where is that really? Join me and we shall rule the galaxy! Already done\\, fleeing a rebel base as the the empire\/first order advance\\, already done\\, master reluctantly teaches student and fails\\, already done! Sub plots pointless\\, main plots pointless. No one cares for the resistance in the galaxy\\, and by the end neither did I.","true":true}
