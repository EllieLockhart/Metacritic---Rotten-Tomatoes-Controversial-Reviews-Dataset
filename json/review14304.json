Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I greatly enjoyed this and felt good during and after the movie. Are there some issues? Yes. Is the movie highly entertaining and setting us up for good future movies? Yes. I think many people are giving low scores here because there are some departures from Star Wars norms. ","true":true}
