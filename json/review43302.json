Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good movie cinematography was excellent acting has gone down a bit but the CGI was off the chain and also I like how it left you hanging for the last movie ","true":true}
