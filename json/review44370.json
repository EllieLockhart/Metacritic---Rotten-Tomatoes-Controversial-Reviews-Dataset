Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes\\, unappropriate humor in many of the serious moments of the film\\, unnecessary and dull Canto Bight sequence. Many of the characters are inconsistent with the previous films. Dull new characters (Rose and Holdo) and don't even get me started about the Leia scene. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley's Rey are the only redeeming qualities of this film.","true":true}
