{"101487":167526,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-07-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So after waiting a week for the crowds to die down\\, and avoiding all reviews on TLJ\\, I finally got to settle in and watch the movie.  It was a mixed bag to say the least.  Sadly the positives are mostly technical in nature. Sound\\, visual effects\\, and the music are all what you have come to expect from one of the originators of THX and immersive sensory moviegoing experience.  Before I get into a more critical review\\, I want to first say that I am not married to Star Wars Canon\\, and generally have no issue with director's and screenwriters taking well established franchises into new directions.  We have seen it with James Bond\\, Star Trek\\, Jurassic Park and other long running  movie chapters that are not bound by pre-written material (such as Harry Potter).  In fact\\, there are well over 30 easter eggs\/nods to Star Wars canon  scattered throughout this slog of a movie.  My main issue is that it breaks the fundamental tenet:  Effects and action sequences should be used to advance the story\\, not the opposite.  \\nThe opening of the movie starts with the traditional narrative crawl up the screen\\, but there wasn't any continuity to the ending of TFA.  The one thing the original trilogy did well\\, is that the previous movie set up the anticipation for the next\\, and the next picked right up where the previous left off.  In TLJ\\, yes we meet up with both Luke and Rey staring at eachother\\, but the opening scene has Poe staring down a dreadnought class destroyer\\, with three other flanking Star Destroyers.\\n  \\nThe sole objective of the first order is to destroy (take no prisoners). So why do they sit there with Poe off the bow and engage in a ridculous comedy skit?  Poe is not Han in the detention center in ANH engaging over the intercom while Luke rescues Leia. This was embarassing and just dumb.  Aside from that\\, this 4 destroyer fleet only has a handful of tie fighters to protect them?  The Dreadnaught\\, while clearly vulnerable to close-up engagements only has 6 turrets across it's massive structure?  And those other three Star Destroyers that shoot so accurately to hit tiny asteriods (in ESB) can shoot Poe?  Regardless\\, once again the Empire\/First Order is easily defeated.  Snoke's time would be better spent holding his engineers accountable for designing such vulnerable military equipment time and time again.  \\n\\nLuke's story was just disappointingly drawn out. He teaches very little to Rey\\, and that is the problem. Luke came by his way of the force thru lengthy training and real life experiences that severely tested his beliefs.  Rey\\, who we eventually find out apparently comes from nobodies\\, not only has raw strength superior to Luke\\, but has much more control over it.  Nice nod to JRR Tolkien \\\"even the smallest person can change the course of the future\\\".  So\\, after all this canon and 40 years of filmdom\\, anyone can be embued with the force (spoiler - pretty sure you will also find Poe has some force in him as well).  But that isn't even the egregious part.  Despite Obi Wan living as a hermit\\, he still came forward to fight his former student when called upon.  Here\\, Luke has severed ties with everyone\\, including his sister despite knowing how evil his student\\, and nephew\\, was?  He felt no responsibility to try and prevent the deaths of millions (remember\\, multiple planets were destroyed by StarKiller in TFA).  He didn't \\\"sense\\\" any imbalance in the force\\, didn't foresee Rey\\, didn't sense his sister being sucked out into space and apparently having her own Jedi moment - ala Mary Poppins?  I get that he shut himself off\\, but seriously\\, what is the point of having him as a hermit in the mode of Obi Wan\\, but no sense of duty when called upon?  I kept hoping to see him \\\"raise\\\" his X-Wing from the water (like Yoda in ESB) and join his sister to once again fight against the dark side.\\n\\nLeia was commanding in her screen time\\, but was still less than expected.  I hope they have a fitting end to her character in the next installment\\, because it would be a shame to have all three of the original heroes go out in lame endings...\\n\\nNow to the new cast.  Two movies in\\, and none have grown or expanded as a character. Rey still has powers with no sense of how or why. She doesn't know who her parents are. I still have two WTF moments with her I am trying to figure out. How did she end up back on the Falcon after fighting Snopes guards\\, and where the heck did her and Chewie disappear to after leading the tie fighters away from the battle on Crait. They were absent during the whole Luke \\\"projection\\\" battle with Kylo\\, but somehow came back just in time to rescue what remained of the rebels from the back door to the cave.  Was she summoned by Leia? Was Poe calling to her (like he did Maz - who he never met before? - I won't go there) with what seems to be an attraction at the end (hello Joey Tribiani).  \\nWithout going into Poe and Finn - suffice it to say - nothing they do in this movie matters - they just fill screen time doing things that have no bearing on the story except Poe's opening assault on the Dreadnaught.  They don't grow as characters\\, nothing new is revealed about them.  Like most of this movie - the men are all weak and ineffective\\, and the women are all strong. I am fine with women leaders - but some balance would be nice. \\n\\nSnoke was a waste of a good villain. Though imaginative\\, it was disappointing how easily he went out. And then we have a drawn out battle between arguably the best light saber wielders in the galaxy against 8 guards.  Couldn't they have used the force on them to disarm or distract them?  Yes\\, I get it\\, the battle was top notch in terms of choreography\\, but again\\, the story was there to service the effects and action\\, vs the other way around.  \\n\\nThe whole jaunt to Canto Bight by Finn and Rose made no sense\\, made no difference to the story\\, and again was a \\\"hey - we need some more action and effects here\\, so put something in the script so we can showcase some space camels our effects guys came up with\\\" and \\\"wouldn't it be cool to have parking violations for space ships?\\\"  Which\\, apparently\\, is a jail sentence. Regardless\\, the rebels own actions and lack of faith in their leaders (in this case Holdo) actually end up killing more of their comrades.  They had a plan all along\\, and only because Finn goes on the stupid \\\"code cracker\\\" mission does benicio's character find out about the plan and inform Hux\\, which leads to escape pods being blown up.  No remorse by any of the rebels as their comrades are continually killed by their own actions.\\n\\nKylo is like Will's mom in stranger things.  Weirdly entertaining but on the verge of crying in every scene.  His \\\"projections\\\" to Rey were interesting and would have liked to explore those more.  But\\, was an odd twist that despite the obvious \\\"Kylo is leaving footprints in the salt and Luke is not\\\" should have easily be noticeable by Kylo. After he projected into the \\\"hut\\\" with Rey where Luke saw them\\, why would Kylo not think Luke can do the same?  This was a redux of the infamous masks in Tom Cruise's mission impossible.  It was original in MI2 and then got overused in subsequent movies.  He ends the movie right back where he started\\, but this time without Snoke. Rey is stronger than him\\, he is still tormented\\, and I am confused.  What is his \\\"grand plan\\\" since it is clear Rey won't turn to the dark side.\\n\\nTo get some emotional attachment to this story\\, I was so hoping Finn would sacrifice himself into that cannon. Even if he wasn't successful\\, maybe he would have been \\\"the spark\\\". Instead we have Rose save him for no reason.  (by the way - how the heck did she get to the falcon? nobody was dragging her unconscious body through the caves. she just ended up in the sick bay with Finn suddenly in love (because she kissed him)....\\n\\nOK\\, this ran longer than I thought\\, but there are so many plot holes and lazy storytelling here that it is frustrating.  I don't understand any of these 5 star reviews.  If it was any other movie\\, it would be passable.  But if you are going to pick up a story on a universe that has unfolded to us over 40 years and 8 prior movies (including Rogue One)\\, you can't just switch it all up and defy the laws that have been established without some creative setups and backstory.  It's not like Disney isn't committed to cranking out a SW movie every year\\, so why destroy not only the flow of this trilogy\\, but it's progression as a chapter in story that has already been unfolding in front of us.  Rian has a whole new trilogy he's been given the reins to that he could have taken new characters and battles in any direction he wanted to.  \\n\\nI have no clue what JJ has up his sleeves for Episode IX.  There was very little left undone - not at all like the end of ESB like this movie is continually being compared to as their best SW movie.  To me\\, this is one of the worst of the movies\\, and it's all due to the lazy writing and nonsensical subplots that just prolong the movies but added very little to advance characters or overall story.  This movie is clearly written for a newer generation (As Hamill said - this is not my Luke).  The new generation has less desire for story continuity in multi-chapter epics\\, and are more awed by the visuals than the narrative.  On that level\\, it hits its mark perfectly.  You would almost forget this was a SW movie except they overuse of \\\"Rebel Scum\\\" every 10 minutes.\\nThis was the first SW movie I have ever been to where NOT ONE person in the theater applauded at the end\\, or stuck thru credits hoping for something more.  They all walked morosely out of the theater wondering WTF they just watched.","true":true}
