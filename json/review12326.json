Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so sad! All you saw and loved in the originals was meaningless. All the strong men turned out to not be strong. Everyone cut and ran once it got hard except Leia! The original cast never were together. Rey just magically can do everything better than everyone else. Disney apparently has a new agenda to use it for some other message.","true":true}
