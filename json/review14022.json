Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you like a slow moving\\, horribly paced\\, space ship chase this film is for you! Unfortunately that's not the Star Wars I think many fans were looking for. So many of the choices made in this film were just poor.  From Luke's character choices\\, Finn and Rose's pointless sub-plot\\, flying Leia\\, to completely dismantling the story arch started by J.J. Abrams\\, this film completely missed the mark.","true":true}
