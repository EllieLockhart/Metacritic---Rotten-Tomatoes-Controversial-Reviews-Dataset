Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been so disappointed by a Star Wars film.. I love the franchise and the ledgands extended universe. This film has destroyed any hope for it. \\n\\nSnoke wtf\\n\\nKylo wtf\\n\\nKnights of the Ren wtf\\n\\nLuke wtf\\n\\nRey wtf\\n\\nEVERYTHING WTF...\\n\\nSo many missed opportunities to create an amazing addition to the franchise. The attempt at the humor in this film was cringe worthy and every time they tried to be funny just took me out of the world. \\nThis was the least starwars feeling movie ever.","true":true}
