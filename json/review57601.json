Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was such an utter disappointment for this life-long Star Wars fan who saw the original in the theaters back in '77 and every one since.    This film is a slap in the face to SW fans from previous generations and made it very clear that Disney was getting rid of the old and starting over new (yes\\, we heard it reiterated in the film again and again).  The character development was nill\\, the persona of Luke Skywalker was assassinated as was that of just about every lead character in the film who wasn't a female.  Oh\\, yes\\, and the force-feeding of the SJW mandate was nauseating - is there nothing that isn't sacred these days?  The film was filled with pointless scenes and gaping plot holes.  The main villain was easily dispatched with the flick of a switch and let's not even begin to discuss the disturbing lack of realism in some of the scenes (frozen Leia\\, bombs in space\\, etc.).   Oh\\, and the worst of all - the inane humor that doesn't fit Star Wars in any way\\, shape or form with the opening prank call scene being absolutely cringe-worthy.  Who wrote this script anyway - Beavis and Butthead?  But seriously\\, the story was badly written\\, the character development non-existant without homage to the original trilogy at all - but was beautifully filmed and scored\\, which made it visually and aurally pleasing enough to get a passing grade.  I won't likely go to see any more of this story-line in the theaters after seeing this - I'll just watch it at home.  Sorry Disney\\, but you dropped the ball with Rian - better give JJ back the keys to the SW kingdom before it all goes down in flames.","true":true}
