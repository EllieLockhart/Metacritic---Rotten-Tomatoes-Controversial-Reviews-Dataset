Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is kind of a mixed bag. There are a few great moments marred by some not so great moments.\\n\\nThe movie starts off with the Rebels already under attack by the First Order\\, following the destruction of the Starkiller base in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe crux of the movie is split between 3 different parties; Rey with Luke\\, Finn and the Rebels themselves. Finn's arc in this movie is personally\\, the low point of the movie as a whole. His arc serves no real purpose and it was not at all enjoyable to see him go through them. His mission was ironic\\, in that it ended up doing the exact opposite of what he was trying to achieve going in.\\n\\nThen we have the Rebels' side\\, with the focus on Poe Dameron and their struggle to keep the last remaining bit of the Rebels alive. There is a conflict between Poe and another character in this arc that I felt was unnecessary and could have been handled better.\\n\\nUndoubtedly\\, the most interesting arcs in the movie are the ones related to Rey and Luke\\, and by extension Kylo Ren as well. Many of the lingering questions that stemmed from The Force Awakens have been answered here. The pay off of Rey's arc in the movie is worth the price of admission\\, in and of itself\\, culminating to a very awesome action sequence. Easily my favorite moment in the movie.\\n\\nAll the character arcs eventually leads to the finale which is where the movie really shines. There is an entire moment in the finale that is just as amazing as the one I mentioned above\\, involving a certain character. The revelation of it was nothing short of amazing. Possibly the greatest use of the Force I have ever seen thus far.\\n\\nSo as a conclusion\\, was The Last Jedi a worthy sequel? Yes\\, kind of. The movie have some really fun and great moments but also elements that I am not particularly a fan of. The movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes\\, by the way. I would probably watch the movie a second time\\, just to make sure but The Last Jedi did not manage to be my 5\/5 movie of the year.","true":true}
