Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a large disappointment. The big space chase was tragically slow and boring\\, none of the characters seemed to have direction\\, and the major plot actions that happened to Leia\\, Luke\\, and the First Order capital ship we're so absurd that it pulled me out of the story to think: what were they thinking? A waste of time that would be hugely improved if edited down to just an hour long.","true":true}
