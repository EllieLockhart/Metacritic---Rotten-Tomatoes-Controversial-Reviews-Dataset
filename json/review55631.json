Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not terrible\\, but definitely an unworthy sequel.  Approximately a third of it was compelling (and in fairness\\, some parts of that third were very compelling\\, including some of the best writing on The Force since Empire and a welcome return to its overtly spiritual beginnings) but the central plotline was a slog\\, and relied entirely on in-universe plot holes and multiple protagonists who were a joy to watch in the last movie suddenly vacillating between villainous and childish solely to contrive conflict.  \\n\\nYou could really feel that it was a different director than the last one\\, as literally dozens of established characters and plot threads from the previous movies were unceremoniously swept off the table by being killed offsceen or ended with a single line of clunky dialogue.  It felt petulant\\, like a child intentionally breaking toys because they knew their sibling wanted them when they were done with them\\, and I don't know where a sequel could possibly go from the ashes this movie leaves the franchise with.\\n\\nReally\\, it comes down to this movie not being very fun.  It's a depressing slog contrived and maintained by nonsensical character decisions and melodrama\\, culminating in an uninspired return to status quo sans almost all of the characters that could have been used to create something else.  There are scenes between Rey and Luke that are very good and worth watching\\, and the charisma of Finn and Leia is so strong that it does occasionally shine through the morass of the other plotlines\\, but you'll have to dig through a lot of garbage to find the gems\\, and ultimately I was left feeling simply tired.","true":true}
