Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did questions posed by The Force Awakens keep you intrigued and exited for the past 2 years? Well prepare to hate the answers when finally unveiled. This film has poor pacing\\, stand still character development (for most)\\, and jokes that land as rarely as the movie exites. All while giving an underwhelming end to new and old loved characters alike. There is nothing to look forward too in it's next installment\\, and that's a major problem.","true":true}
