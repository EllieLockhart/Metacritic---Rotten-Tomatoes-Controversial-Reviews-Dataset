Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie. There was a lot going on in it. I did like how they went back and told us what happened with Luke's apprentices. I enjoyed the fight sceens very much. I wished they wouldn't of thrown away Snoke. Who is he? What is he? I get where they are going with this but they could of touched a little more on some characters. I am glad certain ones did not die right away. I was also very pleased to see some old faces return and in a very fitting manner. Overall\\, I enjoyed it. I can't wait to see where they take this in a galaxy so very far away.","true":true}
