Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is hot garbage juice. Pretty hot garbage juice\\, but garbage juice nonetheless. Nonsensical character arcs\\, pointless characters\\, pointless story-crushing \\\"twists\\\" and a truly short-sighted view to the franchise by the director\/writers pushed purely to help push an agenda. 1 star for the visuals\\, 1 star for the truly fantastic performance from some of the actors in the face of their terrible script.","true":true}
