Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi's worst flaw - though there were many - is that it failed to regard the Star Wars universe with consistency. Characters used the force in incredible ways that directly contradict what was implied to be remotely possible in the entire history of the franchise. The fact that the film puts no effort into in-world consistency and instead bends the Star Wars reality to its narrative has severely damaged the within-universe realism of Star Wars as a whole.","true":true}
