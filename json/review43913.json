Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though the Force Awakens better captured the feeling of the original Star Wars trilogy\\, The Last Jedi opens up the franchise for more possibilities. I'd suggest multiple viewings since the first time around you are so caught up with the film's many unexpected turns that you miss what's great about. This film will keep us talking for years to come.","true":true}
