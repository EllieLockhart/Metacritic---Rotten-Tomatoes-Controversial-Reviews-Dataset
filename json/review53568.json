Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extraordinary visuals and astounding soundtrack is not enough to save a movie. Featuring both unconvincing villains and heroes\\, a terrible storyline\\, lack of respect for Star Wars lore\\, this movie is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent times. Also\\, the attempt to push politics came off\\, at best\\, as plain silly\\, at worst extremely cringeworthy. But one fundamentally good thing. It will serve as an example for decades to come on how NOT to make a movie\\, and as such\\, serves a purpose. Avoid at all cost\\, unless you are a student of movie-making learning how NOT to make a movie.","true":true}
