Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is enjoyable for non-star wars nerds. This film is apparantly not worth a star wars film for those fanatical nerds. If you are not one of these\\, you will enjoy this film like I did.","true":true}
