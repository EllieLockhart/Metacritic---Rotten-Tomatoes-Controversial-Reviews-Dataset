Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi was not only a lazy piece of cinema\\, but a failed attempt to combine the problems of our reality with the wars in the stars. Rather than working with the masses of lore within the star wars universe--riaan johnson decided that 2017 slap-stick humor and plot confusion was a better fit. Sad to see star wars sink to the status of the sub-par yearly marvel movies. You had the gift of working with star wars\\, and made something forgettable with it. This movie is bantha fodder.","true":true}
