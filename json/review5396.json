Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite criticisms it was still a fun movie. But there were a few things that left me puzzled but it was fun to watch with my wife and she loved it. Enjoying Star wars with my non-fan wife was the best part of this movie. However this movie pushes its boundaries on the star wars universe a little bit....both with success and not so much success.","true":true}
