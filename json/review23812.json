Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke wasn't Luke\\, The Jedi and especially Luke woul'd never\\, ever\\, ever act like that. That's something that even Mark Hamill hinself said.\\nThe director gave us the mittle finger on the question \\\"who are Rey's parents?\\\"\\nspoler alert - The super-mega-master villain Snoke was killed like a newbie and absolutely nothing was revealed about him either.\\nThe strategy of the rebels is a Joke and invoque 2 Deux Ex Machina to work and\\, were is the rest of the galaxie? After all the 1st Order did a direct atack in the republic's core!\\nThey wasted Captain Phasma... Again!\\nAnd to finish\\nMary Poppins Leia!!!!!!!
