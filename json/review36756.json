Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie misses lots of opportunities to tell more of the story and add depth to the characters. It does not seem to find the right balance between humour and solemnity\\, and often times shows utter disrespect towards the prequels. While it is eager to fade out the old heroes (and their legacy)\\, it fails to make us attach to or care about the new ones. Eye-candy was okay though.","true":true}
