Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics are on Disney's payroll.  This installment is THE worst Star Wars movie ever.  Forced laughs with the story-telling consistency of an Alzheimer's patient stoned out of his\/her mind.  This thing is a big pile of garbage.","true":true}
