{"101487":122106,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the point at which Luke takes the light saber held out for him by plucky young Rey\\, and throws it into the water behind him\\, it's plain to see that the creators have 'Let the past die'. More than that\\, they killed it.\\n\\nAt the crux of the successful original trilogy\\, and to a lesser extent the prequels\\, there was a unique seriousness about the films. This was effectively written off as something of history\\, as even the most serious characters found themselves reduced to mere comic relief in certain scenes. Take for example\\, Luke drinking milk from a hideous alien beast\\, throwing a lightsaber passed down through generations into the sea. Leia's quibbling with Poe\\, and even (unintentionally comical) transforming into superman ever so briefly to fly back towards the ship\\, stopping her from having a poignant meaningful death in the films.\\n\\nBetween cutting short the suspense of the origins of Snoke\\, the somewhat meaningless introduction of Benicio Del Toro's thief character\\, the anti-climactic death of Phasma and the lack of fanfare with the deaths of series stalwarts such as Admiral Akbar\\, we see no care at all taken towards people who enjoy the original series or even storylines that were introduced by The Force Awakens. Add to this\\, any storylines introduced in the Last Jedi hold no interest leading into the next film.\\n\\nThe message at the end of the film is clear; the old resistance is dying\\, it's up to a new resistance to take up the fight. It's only unfortunate that with meaningless deaths to original and recognizable characters\\, and the removal of Snoke as a mysterious and interesting villain\\, I do not care too much for this new resistance or its fight.","true":true}
