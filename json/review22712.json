Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like three movies. Only one of them good. The most boring of the three is basically ships chasing each other slowly for an hour. The only good story has Rey and Luke and some Kylo. Elements here\\, including a fight scene\\, are simply thrilling. The rest is basically lifeless and devoid of the snark that laced the first one of these three. Must be the loss of Han.","true":true}
