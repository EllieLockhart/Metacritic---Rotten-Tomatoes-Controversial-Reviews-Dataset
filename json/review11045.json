Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hello\\, \\n\\nMy name is Marcel and i am a mysagonist\\, racist and i hate women... oh sorry... thats wrong.
