Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic! The real essence of Star Wars comes back here! Absolutely the perfect sequel and bridge in story that was needed. It puts a lot of pressure on episode 9 to make it all come together in the end though. The biggest missing link is how and why snoke came to power. Rey was a little too quick to learn her lessons\\, but that can also be remedied in episode 9 with more context","true":true}
