{"101487":127485,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here are the problems\\, in no particular order as they are all pretty severe:\\n\\n1.\tThe so-called writing and plot:\\n\tThe story on its own merits was stupid.  A slow-speed chase through space in which the First Order should have easily been able to flank the rebels.  Also\\, what does it matter in a vacuum with no gravity if you are running out of fuel? It doesn't\\, and your speed will not change when you do. Finally\\, if Vice Admiral Gender Studies had such a great \\\"plan\\\" why not just tell everyone?  I mean aside from by not telling they were able to make Poe look like a dangerous and unstable male (which of course is exactly why they did it)\\n\tThe subplot on the casino was even worse! Even if you ignore the over the top leftism about animal rights and evil rich people\\, what exactly did this part of the story offer?   It could have NOT BEEN IN THE STORY AT ALL and nothing changes. And it ruined Finn's movie\\, who was at least somewhat of an interesting character in the last movie. \\n\tMary Poppins Leia\\, bombs \\\"dropping\\\" in zero G\\, the aforementioned misunderstanding of basic Newtonian physics re: momentum and inertia\\, making Chewie a damn vegan\\, etc an numerous other ridiculous things.   Oh\\, and the humor that just wasn't funny. At all.\\n\tMost importantly in this section\\, disregarding all the questions set up in the LAST MOVIE?!  Who are Rey's parents?  Oh\\, never mind they were nobodies. Who is this badass Snoke?  Oh never mind\\, we are just going to kill him off lamely (and Phasma too)  Where did the First Order even come from? No answer.\\n2.\tDisrespect to the original Star Wars\\n\tWhat they did to Luke was criminal.  The hero of the entire saga.  The boy who through much pain and trials finally becomes a wise Jedi master. The master who walked into evils lair and risked everything to redeem his mass murdering father\\, and who saw the good in his father when no one else did. The hero who constantly risked his life for his friends.  THAT GUY is now a bitter and cowardly old hermit who pisses on everything he ever believed in and is AFRAID to join the fight.  Oh\\, and he tried to kill his pre-teen nephew in his sleep.  Yeah\\, makes perfect sense. Oh\\, and his death was pointless.\\n\tThe \\\"deconstruction\\\" of the Jedi through Luke's aforementioned pissing on everything they stood for\\, AND bringing in Yoda to essentially do the same!  \\n\tThe \\\"deconstruction\\\" of the entire ethos\/ pathos of Star Wars.  Self sacrifice\\, self denial\\, loyalty to friends\\, loyalty to family\\, striving for good\\, fearing and respecting evil\\, knowing the difference between good and evil.  All of that basically pissed on too.\\n\tMarginalizing Chewie\\, C3PO and R2D2\\n\tMary Poppins Leia\\, who never before showed Force acumen.  Girl Power I guess. \\n\tFinally\\, the episodic movies (i.e. all but Rogue One) have focused on the Skywalker Family. Eps 1-3 were Anakins story. Eps 4-6 were Luke's. Eps 7-9 SHOULD have been his children's or other relations.  I guess that's still sort of intact with Kylo but not really. And makes the lack of Rey backstory all the more frustrating (at least could have made her a Kenobi if not a Skywalker).  And now the character of Luke is dead and the actress who plays his sister is too.  There's nowhere to go.\\n3.\tProblems with new characters\\n\tCore characters\\ni.\tRey simply isn't believable or relatable at all.  Not without a family backstory.  She is a master of EVERYTHING (flying ships\\, weaponry\\, astral projection\\, light saber duels\\, the Force) less than a week of story time after even hearing about the Force!! REALLY?!  How can anyone relate to a character who has no arc at all?\\nii.\tPoe has been reduced to a buffoonish sort of white male who needs correcting from stronger females.  You cannot have emasculated male heroes\\, it just does not work.  Or villains for that matter (see kylo and hux\\, below)\\niii.\tFinn started off promising but didn't develop AT ALL in this movie.   He could have at least had a meaningful death if Rose (who is the most pointless character ever) had not fucked it up. And they might as well kill off either Finn or Poe as they are basically the same character\\, and there is not room for two rebellious Han Solo types.\\niv.\tKylo is not intimidating at all. He is a confused and angsty millennial who whines all the time.  And he is now the leader of a fear based organization in the First Order?  Really?  \\n\tOther characters\\ni.\tHux-  even more of an unconvincing villain than Kylo.  Cartoonish at best.\\nii.\tRose-  the most worthless semi-main character in SW history\\, and most annoying since Jar Jar Binks.  And again\\, how does a fucking janitor learn to fly all these ships?  Plus denies Finn an awesome death which would have at least have been one good scene in the film. Girl power.\\niii.\tVice Admiral Gender Studies-  don't get me started.  Shitty leader and pointless character\\, except to use as a device to go male bashing in the person of Poe. Girl power.\\niv.\tSnoke and Phasma-  sigh.....  we hardly knew ye.\\n4.\tPolitics. Movies are supposed to be entertaining.  Star Wars was a cultural icon which should be shared by everyone\\, not reduced to a SLW propaganda hit piece. \\n\tRampant and obvious misandry-   Nothing wrong with a strong female lead but that doesn't make all men weak and stupid.  Tell me one male in the move which was not weak\\, cowardly\\, stupid\\, reckless\\, embittered\\, or some combo thereof.  There weren't any.\\n\tVegan Chewie and other over the top animal rights sermons\\n\tAnti capitalism-  Seriously\\, Disney?\\n\tGeneral millennial nihilism.","true":true}
