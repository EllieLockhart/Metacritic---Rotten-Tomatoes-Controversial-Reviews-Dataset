Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Script: 3\/5\\nPerformances: 4\/5\\nVisuals: 5\/5\\nMusic: 3\/5\\nPlot: 1\/5\\nCharacters: 2\/5\\nCharacter Development: 2\/5\\nVillians: 3\/5\\nHeroes: 3\/5\\nPacing: 1\/5\\nEffects: 5\/5\\nPorgs: 5\/5\\nOVERALL SCORE: 6.3\/10 or D\\nPros: Amazing Visuals\\, Great Effects\\, and Decent Acting (also porgs)\\nCons: Terrible Plot\\, Obvious Plotholes (to anyone with a brain)\\, Bad Character Development\\, Pointless Scenes\\, Rey IS a Mary Sue\\, Way too much Comedy which Sucked\\, Bad Pacing\\, and God Knows how many more Problems with this Movie (also porgs)\\nMoney Acquired: OVER 9000\/10 (F**k Disney)","true":true}
