Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I\u2019ve been waiting years for this game and I avoided all the spoilers and leaks the best I could but after finishing the game\\, I now understand the anger of those people got from those.

The game itself is amazing\\, gameplay is very pleasant and it\u2019s almost an upgrade from the first game\\, also the graphics are very much an improvement\\, impressive to look at. It feels like an open world\\, so sometimes\\, especially in the beginning it feels a bit overwhelming but soon you\u2019ll get the hang of it and it\u2019s really nice. The game menu has an accessibility feature and it has a lot of great things for people who are not that good at the game\\, it helps. What ruins the game is that Ellie almost looks like a man\\, yes she is lesbian\\, fine we get that\\, but why make her LOOK like a man? I don\u2019t get that\\, even her voice\\, it\u2019s like this rough sounding lesbian woman and okay that maybe fits a lesbian woman but it\u2019s too much and it\u2019s simply not the  Ellie I remember.... And then Joel suddenly dies by the hand of this woman?... man... woman who looks like a man? Yes\\, a woman who looks EXACTLY like a man! And then you HAVE to play as HER HIM! For almost the rest of the game\\, and I would get that if she\/he was a lovable character but she\/he isn\u2019t\\, I hated her\/him for the entire game\\, so that was absolutely awful\\, playing like that. The story ruined the whole game. The music wasn\u2019t good either. The first game left me with this deep feeling inside when that last music started at the credits but this... there was NOTHING... music was bad\\, ending was meh...I completely forgot. they promised we wouldn't have to kill dogs but guess what... we have to kill DOGS! So unacceptable!!! And why the lies??!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
