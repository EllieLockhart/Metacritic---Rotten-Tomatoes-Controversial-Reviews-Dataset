Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Force Awakens was a conventional take on Star Wars for the fan who loved the originals\\, Last Jedi is on the other end of that spectrum. It takes chances by looking at new aspects of the force and challenging what we think we know about this galaxy. I appreciate it for that.","true":true}
