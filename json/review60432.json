However I personally think the story it self is boring\\, it has it\u2019s moments of course\\, but most of the time you are running from A-to-B chasing the next objectives. As the journey itself is fun\\, exploring this stunning world feels pretty good\\, the story behind is pretty boring. Naughty dog tries to catch you with emotions during the cut-scenes and dialogs (by the way you don\u2019t see any graphical cut between gameplay and cut-scene \u2013 superb!)\\, but for me the game feels to long\\, the story takes to long to unfold. I had to force myself to finish the game\\, due to hard times and boring parts. And frankly I\u2019m glad I finished it\\, the end is pretty rewarding! At least I liked it\\, because it was kinda unexpected. 15hrs would have been perfect for that story\\, so it feels like the time you need to finish is way to long for the story. And usually I enjoy playing games for hundreds of hours (RPG are my favorite genre\u2026)\\, but here if just feels wrong. Well this might be just my opinion. However\\, for me this is a 7\/10 game. Unfortunately\\, it isn\u2019t a must play\\, like the first last of us was.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
