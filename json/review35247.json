Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Good:\\nIt is a visually stunning movie that many scenes are very well shot and breathe taking. This film indeed is a emotional roller coaster and some scenes will give the audience a chill because they are unexpected. Battle scene is very intense. This film also explores the concept of force in different perspectives. \\nThe Bad:\\nI agree with most of the comments that The Last Jedi just disregards the cliffhangers established in The Force Awakens such as Snoke's identity and Rey's parents. Finn and Rose's arc at Casino is not well executed and can be a drag. Film's overall length can be shortened by providing a more focused story.","true":true}
