{"101487":138222,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short\\, it just feels wrong like a too small t-shirt. \\n\\nwhat was good?\\nonce again the craftmanship of the movie was great. The setting felt like a Star Wars movie. Even Yoda felt good\\, as he was the original one. \\nAlso the young actors did a great job. This time Kylo was better\\, Finn got somewhat wasted here.\\nI like the porgs. They are not overdone like the trailer could have suggested. Just a nice addition.\\n\\nWhat wasnt good?\\nStory\\, Luke\\, Holdo\\, Ackbar\\, Logic errors\\, Leia\\, Canto Bight (Politics)\\, Snoke\\, Gen. Hucks dismantling...\\n\\nHucks:\\nWhy is he made a pathetic puppet? One had the hope to see a successor of Tarkin\\, instead you see a Spaceballs version of Lord helmet.\\n\\nSnoke:\\nRanting about how inexperienced Kylo Ren is\\, a kid with a mask who can hide nothing from Snoke... Snoke was build up to be a big big mystery and so strong that even \\\"the immense power Luke was fearing in Kylo\\\" was too weak compared.\\nAnd then Snoke is taken out like an inexperienced Storm Trooper.\\n\\nCanto Bight:\\nWhy! Why bring in politics again? Wasnt Part 1-3 enough dry content with politics? Ok I get it in Rogue One. Showing that the rebels take drastic actions as well and kill an informant. But bringing in Canto Bight feels like the way Star Trek usually tries to mirrors society. And that feels so wrong with Star Wars. If you must bring it in movies like Solo or Rogue One\\, but leave Star Wars out of it. \\n\\nLeia:\\nCarry Fisher died sadly. While i am happy to see her a bit longer\\, the Marry Poppins way she survived was pathetic. Using the force to re-route those torpedoes would have looked less pathetic. \\nThey will have a hard time having her in part IX without let it look stupid.\\n\\nLogic errors:\\nThere are sooooo many logic errors. First\\, why not jump ahead with 2-3 star destroyer?\\nRey\\, beats Kylo\\, even though he scared Luke and was in an academy with Luke to train?\\nAlso a 3rd DeathStar was just destroyed which cost at least 1 million First Order lives. How can the First Order still be on the brink of victory?\\nOnly 400 people left in the \\\"Republic\\\"? Poe is speaking in the name of the Republic. But thats only 400 \\\"Resistance\\\". No one is answering to the calls. The resistance aka the republic is by now weaker than the comic version of \\\"Rebels\\\". They even have 2 Jedi at their side. But 400 people in the whole galaxy fighting for the cause of the republic? Common\\, 400 people on one planet would have been pathetic\\, but in the whole galaxy? \\n\\nHoldo & Ackbar:\\nHoldo is the most disgusting display of arrogance and bad leadership i have seen in a while. While it is displayed in real life all to often. \\nHer way of treating the most distinguished pilot leads to the death of about 300 of those 400 people. In her arrogance she did not include Poe into her plans. In fact she did not tell anyone of her plans. Instead she is provocating even more by not taking Poe serious. So\\, concerned as he is\\, believing there is no plan he does something in which course the hacker learns of the plans to evacuate and is than able to tell the first order. \\n\\nNext to all this\\, she is taking the place of Ackbar\\, which is dishonering the character of Ackbar. It would have to be he who should have rescued the lot.\\n\\nLuke:\\nMark Hamill already said he is not happy with the way his role was treated. Basically Luke Skywalker is denying to do his part. When he came to the caves on the salt planet\\, one had the hope that he is now over his erratic behaviour. That powerful as he is now\\, he will force crush 2-3 of those walkers. Instead he dies?\\n\\nStory:\\nThere has been soooo much good content known from the books. Instead they continue to repeat stuff instead of developing the know Star Wars universe. After Han & Ackbar are dead. R2 barely playing at all. Now Luke is gone. Leia cant play a big part seeing Carry Fisher is dead... This is a freaking reset.\\nHow can 30 years after the victory of Endor\\, the Republic be so small\\, so weak? Hell this is worse than a failed state in Afrika or near East.","true":true}
