Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great film. I was born in 1973 and have seen every Star Wars film in the theatre. I have been an enormous fan all my life\\, however\\, I also realize that this is simply a movie. I rate films on the experience I have while watching them. Did I experience emotion? Was I moved by the story? Etc. These are questions I ask. I do not impose some random plot I have concocted in my mind and then give a negative review if the director doesn\u2019t happen to read my mind and fulfill my childhood hopes and dreams. This is a fun movie! Go see it and don\u2019t base your life on fiction. ","true":true}
