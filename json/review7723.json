Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent cinematography\\, a great score\\, and strong performances by Del Toro and Driver could not save this corporate trash that barely passes as a Star Wars film.\\n\\nHowever\\, if you like movies that constantly shifts tone to the point of confusing the viewer\\, massive plot holes throughout\\, failure to build on the intrigue of episode VII\\, character decisions that are absurdly unrealistic\\, and a complete 180 from the original trilogy that made the franchise iconic\\, you'll enjoy this film.\\n\\nThe backlash for this film is absolutely warranted. I understand that Disney is well within its rights to lure in Star Wars enthusiasts with promise of new epics in the same galaxy we grew to love\\, only to pull the rug out from underneath them by completely turning the franchise on it's head. But they shouldn't be surprised when the public rejects the new movies and stops buying tickets en masse.","true":true}
