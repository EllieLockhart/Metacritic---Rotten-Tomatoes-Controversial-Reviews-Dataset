Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not fit with Star Wars as a whole. All of the answers we waited for from The Force Awakens were either not given\\, or were given what I consider to be lazy answers. \\n\\nMany moments feel forced and out of place\\, like a certain love story between two characters\\, or someone flying through space after basically dying. \\nDecisions about Luke's character are questionable and his end is unsatisfactory. \\nBasically\\, after seeing this movie\\, I have the feeling that I no longer care what happens in this story moving forward. This movie is so disjointed and feels so much like a solo movie that I have no idea what could possibly happen in Episode 9 that I would even be interested in watching. \\nIt was a decent and very well-shot and pretty movie on the surface\\, but underneath it is filled with plot holes\\, lazy and forced writing\\, and story decisions that just disappoint you. This does NOT feel like Star Wars\\, it does NOT fit with the new trilogy\\, and it is NOT a good movie overall.","true":true}
