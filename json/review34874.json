Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The \\\"fan backlash\\\" is not real\\, people. There are several trolls on here who have bragged on other sites that they have posted 1000's of negative reviews with different accounts on here\\, imdb and metacritic. They usually mention some hate for Disney and they may not have even seen the film. Its a really great SW film\\, talk to someone in real life who has seen it because you can't trust this site.","true":true}
