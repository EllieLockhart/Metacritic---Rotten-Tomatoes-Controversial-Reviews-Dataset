Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok.\\nI felt as if it was inconclusive\\, snoke still baffles me with his existence.\\nI liked the comedy parts and alien casino stuff but it just felt out of place.\\nIn conclusion i would enjoy a series( tv show) with world building etc Fin's and rose's adventures.","true":true}
