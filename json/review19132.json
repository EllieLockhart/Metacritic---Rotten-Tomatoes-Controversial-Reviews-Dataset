Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's incredible! Made me feel like a kid so over again. I got sucked in and lost in the film for most of the movie (except the middle that drags a bit). It was an incredible experience. I fell in love with Star Wars again. It breathes new life into what was once my favorite film franchise\\, and now is once again.","true":true}
