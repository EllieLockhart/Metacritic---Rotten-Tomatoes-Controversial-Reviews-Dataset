Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson dares to take Star Wars into a whole new direction in which he tries to explores different and new sides of the force and how it can be used. Some parts turn out great and really elevate the characters and there stories(also backed by the stellar acting of Adam Driver\\, Daisey Ridley and Mark Hammil) where other parts fail to add anything and just subtract from the total experience( YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE CANTO BLIGHT)\\, if the movie would have been half an hour shorter fans would have loved it.","true":true}
