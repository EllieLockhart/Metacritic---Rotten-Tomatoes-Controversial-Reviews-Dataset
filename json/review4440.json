Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Certainly not the worst Star Wars film. Cough cough....Attack of the Clones. Still had a number of plot holes\\, things that just didn\u2019t make any sense as well some really poor choices by writer\/director Rian Johnson. At the end of the day this is really the first film in the entire series that doesn\u2019t get you excited for the next movie in the series. ","true":true}
