Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible.\\n\\nThe plot is completely riddled with holes and they completely betrayed the characters and any previous plot lines established in earlier movies. Numerous scenes should have been reworked or cut because of issues with the script. \\n\\nIt seriously is like this director never bother to watch any of the two preceding movies. Don't waste your money on this. Don't support this practice of complacency. It's how every single year we end up with flashy garbage like Jurassic World. These movies are great if you really don't care about any kind of real plot or character development\\, and just want to vegetate in front of mindless explosions\\, inconsistent timing. Most of the movie is an 18th century naval sea chase. \\n\\nWhat an absolute slap in the face to anyone who ever loved the previous movies.","true":true}
