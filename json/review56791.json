Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The pacing of the movie was quicker than the Star Wars tradition. The length of the movie was longer than the Star Wars tradition. \\nGiven the evolution of Luke Skywalker's philosophy and approach to responsibilities\\, the director is lacking the most important psychological knowledge of a personal character's development. First\\, once someone realized that no one should kill the own father\\, meaning\\, that violence is not acceptible in any way\\, that person would not yield a (light)saber on a child\\, nephew\\, anyone younger and considered to be an apprentice. \\nThe Jedi would seek for answers. Luke appears to ignore this - what is a contradiction to his former character. \\nIt appears like the director is obsessed with timeloops. Seeing a possible future is not what a good Jedi would look. As Yoda explains it\\, careful Jedi must be when sensing the future... This is a big big mistake in the movie story. \\nThe battlefront events depicts the First Order as a joke. Making jokes on the main leader\\, General Hux\\, is just a mistake. Ridiculing the enemy is never a good feature of any fighter.","true":true}
