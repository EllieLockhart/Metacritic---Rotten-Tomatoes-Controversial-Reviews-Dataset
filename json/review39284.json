Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has traditional bombers...in outer space. Enough said.\\n\\nThat one braindead element aside\\, the film as a whole was overly long\\, boring\\, convoluted\\, and just plain stupid. I was a big fan of The Force Awakens\\, despite it's over-reliance on similarity with prior entries in the saga. The Last Jedi\\, however\\, tries to be too different\\, changing the rules of the galaxy (and physics) that were previously well-established.\\n\\nSeveral new characters are introduced that amount to absolutely nothing\\, bringing nothing of value to the story. Entire plot points are played out\\, slowly\\, with no payoff.\\n\\nThe action scenes\\, however\\, looked incredible (even if one features fighter pilot flying at high speed without canopies to protect from the wind\\, while their hair remains perfectly in place).\\n\\nOverall\\, just a really disappointing film that tried to cram in as many pointless twists as they could\\, none of which working out.","true":true}
