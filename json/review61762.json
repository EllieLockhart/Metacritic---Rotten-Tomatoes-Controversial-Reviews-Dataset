We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First I like to talk about its gameplay\\, The gameplay of this game is extremely good\\, it is aesthetically pleasing to eyes  the sound quality is great and the visual looks good\\, the stealth mechanic and all the other aspect of this game regards to gameplay mechanics  is simple one of the best.\rbut when it comes to story this game is nothing but a blunder and because of this I am rating this game a 0\/10 because a game like last of us in which it feels and looks like a tv series or a movie\\, Story is all that matters and if the story sucks then the whole game is just trash.\rnow where should I begin there are so many flaws i like to talk about but I want to keep this review as short as possible\rFirst I'd like to talk about Joey\\, the main character of Last of us part 1 In which he was portrayed one of the intelligent  character but  in last of us 2 What The Hell happened  it became a duffer of some kind and a character as great as his dies just like that? thats not acceptable. now coming to the revenge part of this game\\, After joey death Ellie wants to take revenge on every single person who was responsible  for Joey death\\, so what she does? she goes  on a hunt kills everyone who was witness to joey death and were responsible\\, she even kills  a pregnant lady but when it comes to abby the main culprit behind Joey death she chooses to forgive and let go because revenge is bad?\rI mean what? did I miss something? all that buildup only to push a cliche narrative(revenge is bad) that does not even make sense  in this scenario since she has already killed a ton of people even a pregnant lady at this point. this is Dog******* story design.\rNow I'd like to address the politics  this game has how it looks like just a SJW propaganda\\, when you add too much content based on gender identity and sexuality in a game thats when you ****** up because games and comics are a way to escape from real word problems  and to relax\\, so when you start adding gender politics  in games and comics thats when you will face  extreme backlash because nobody gonna like these things in comics and games especially when it is  against their narrative and you start shoving it down to their throats. It was a post apocalyptic  world\\, there was no need to add such things  you could cut these things  and  the story would  have been better and maybe just maybe  you wouldn't receive  a backlash and a permanent stain to your franchise. I don't know why you felt the need to add these in the first place? was it to please the LGBT community or to piss off the gaming community and laugh at their faces?\rIf it was to please LGBT community then it sad to say you've done a pretty bad job because this game is getting a backlash even from people who identify as gay or lesbian.\rand if it was to piss off the gaming community then i'd say you've done a fantastic job because you sure as hell pissed us gamer and it never ends  well I mean just look at the score we gamers have given.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
