Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin. So Disney corrupted the essence of Star Wars with their numerous Marvel-esk timed jokes and shameless addition of kid friendly monsters so they can market toys for profit. Not a big deal at all. It's Disney\\, and we all saw that coming. But the massive plot holes and lack of character development with a inconsistent (with episode 7) story is what killed the movie. If anyone comes to the defense of this poorly directed movie then please comment on these bullet points. \u2022Numerous Forced jokes \u2022Carrie fisher alive in the vacuum of space \u2022why a 1.5 hrs of slow moving star ship chase \u2022No back story on snoke \u2022why more powerful AT-ATs can't hit a target moving in a straight line \u2022How Yoda can use the force when he's dead but hasn't...ever \u2022Why the rebel commander waited until half the fleet was destroyed to do a final do a kamikaze run. \u2022Or how the imperial commander had an entire conversation with an x-wing pilot at the beginning of the movie.
