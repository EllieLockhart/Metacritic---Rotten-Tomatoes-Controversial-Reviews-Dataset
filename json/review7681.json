Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Exactly what I wanted from a Star Wars film. It was great to see Luke as a much more developed character\\, instead of the cookie-cutter hero from the original trilogy. Johnson took a major risk making Luke flawed\\, but in the end\\, the SW universe will be much better in the future because of it.","true":true}
