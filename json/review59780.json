To top it all off\\, the gameplay gives you more liberty on what you can do and how you approach things\\, letting you create your own playstyle and making each situation feel unique. The only things I didn't  like about this game were some minor gameplay issues and the way they poorly handled the marketing by misleading and even lying to the public. Overall\\, I think this is one of the best if not the best game of the generation and definitely the best way to say farewell to the PS4 console. I give this game a rating of 9.8\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
