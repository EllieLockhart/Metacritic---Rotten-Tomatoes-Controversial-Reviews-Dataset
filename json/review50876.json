Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About the only thing that was really difficult was they crammed too much film into too short a period of time.  Honestly i think it would have served a greater purpose to make the Last Jedi a 2-parter so viewers didn't feel so rushed.  Having said that it was crazy SYFY madness along with subtle reminders of how and where it all began.  I for one loved it.","true":true}
