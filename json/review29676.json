Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson takes Star Wars and is able to add something fresh to it while still maintaining the Star Wars feel. Most engaging film I've seen since the Original Trilogy. It is not entirely perfect\\, but it's a fun movie that has a lot of meaning and purpose behind it. \\n\\nOne of my favorite quotes from the film\\, \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you must. That's the only way you can become who you're meant to be.\\\"","true":true}
