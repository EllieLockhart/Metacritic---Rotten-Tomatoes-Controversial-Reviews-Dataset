Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately\\, Rian Johnson pissed on the plot from The Force Awakens and disrespected the iconic characters of Luke and Leia\\, I don't even want to get into details and talk over massive plotholes and lack of logic in some scenes... Such a shame I have been in love with Star Wars for so many years...","true":true}
