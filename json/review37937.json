Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These movies are supposed to be epic\\, which is all about the hero's journey\\, character development and arch. In other words: good writing.\\nUnfortunately\\, this is not the case. Great photography and prod design are ruined by poor writing and awful ideas. All new characters are found pretty much in the same state\/condition which they were at the beginning of the film. Old characters are mistreated in many ways. This movie is a complete fail\\, and no surprise it's the lowest RT score ever for a SW movie.","true":true}
