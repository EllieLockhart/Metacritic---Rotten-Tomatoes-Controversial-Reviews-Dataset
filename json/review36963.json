Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn\u2019t bad\\, but it was very disappointing. So many of the plot lines established in The Force Awakens were just cast aside. Luke flipping his light saber over his shoulder was so anticlimactic. The whole Finn\\, Rose\\, Master Hacker angle was completely stupid. Snoke going out like he did was also a huge waste of a character. So many characters and plot lines were just thrown away. ","true":true}
