I have no idea why people hate the game so much. It\u2019s genuinely awesome. The storyline was brilliant. The graphics are brilliant. The music is brilliant. The voice acting is brilliant. I get some parts of the story make you roll your eyes a bit but what video game doesn\u2019t have some slightly strained plot devices? Yeah sure occasionally a character will do something a bit weird just to get the story moving along but it\u2019s not a reason to give the game such harsh reviews. I can only guess people are upset that Joel dies so brutally and so early in the game but it\u2019s just a video game for gods sake! Another guess is probably because there is a hench woman as main character working with a transgender character but so what? It was done tastefully and didn\u2019t feel overly politically correct at all. My main issue was the searching for loot mechanic felt a bit tedious\\, running around rooms looking for bits got a bit dull but that was my only complaint.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
