Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an honest character study rather than a movie that relies purely on plot device and the wish fulfillment of its \\\"fans.\\\" (Spoilers ahead) I was firmly of the opinion that Rey's parents were Leia and Han\\, and kept pointing out pieces of foreshadowing throughout the film that would indicate I was right. When Rey reveals that her parents were nobodies\\, I all of a sudden found myself hating that I needed her to be part of the story in this way\\, as if the only thing that made her legitimate were her celebrity parents. The same goes for Luke. What an honest depiction of a real and flawed human being who has to contend with his ego and his mistakes as an old man. Most of the criticisms I've seen stem too much from an alt right \\\"I don't want to see POC's or women in my franchise\\, so I'm gonna burn my t-shirts and pummel Rotten Tomatoes with my Facebook bots\\,\\\" that I have little respect for the audience score on this thing. Johnson\\, keep doing what you have been\\, and J.J. Abrams\\, take note of the brilliant story he's set up for you. The Last Jedi manages to be both timely and a perfect addition to the Star Wars universe. I'm ready to watch it again.","true":true}
