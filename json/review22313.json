Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is definitely one of the best Star Wars movies\\, right up there with Empire and A New Hope. While the SW fan in me\\, is somewhat disappointed in the direction the writers chose to go with certain plot threads; it's a fresh version of Star Wars\\, showing us that nothing stays the same forever and even our heroes are imperfect and have weakness to the dark side.","true":true}
