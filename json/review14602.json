Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a star wars fan since a little kid. I remember camping out for the prequels and going to midnight showings. I was sickened  and depressed after seeing this flop. The political and feministic overtones made me want to vomit. The lack of a coherent plot and with so many details being overlooked compels me to leave a review. Management and director ruined this franchise. I'm a Millienial and not an old school generation 1 fan. Yet I had to leave a review about how ruined this film made me feel about future Star Wars movie endeavors.","true":true}
