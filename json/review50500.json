Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"171225: It's amazing how my opinion on a film can fluctuate. I saw this movie first on the 15th and left disappointed. It seemed political correctness and liberty with humour had spoiled the franchise. Then I returned with family on the 25th\\, a friend on the 28th\\, and found myself blown away; and excited for the future of Star Wars. I managed to overlook the silliness and focus on the battle between good and evil\\, light and dark. And what a battle it is becoming. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) appears to be slipping into the dark side further than even Vader did. And\\, it looks like Rey (Daisy Ridley) will be representing the light for a long time to come. It's a good rivalry with a lot of power and hatred. So\\, let go of your thoughts and reach out to feel the force this franchise can bring. Finally\\, I highly recommend the Leduc Theatre if Cineplex gouging has driven you away. They don't even charge for layering. Long live locally owned businesses.","true":true}
