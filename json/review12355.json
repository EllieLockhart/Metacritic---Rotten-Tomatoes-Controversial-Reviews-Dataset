Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am very sad about what this movie has done to star wars. It turned an epic story into a slap stick money maker with a horrible plot.  The acting was good but this movie had so much potential and fell completely flat.  I almost wish that I had not seen it.","true":true}
