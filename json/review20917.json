Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed. Neither the new director nor the screenwriters could cope with the task. Yes\\, the film turned out colorful\\, visually pleasing. There are some good solutions. But superman-Leah\\, degraded and stern Luke\\, a rag Kylo Ren and Ray\\, who is put on a pedestal of moral and physical achievements without doing anything for this\\, look comical. What infuriates me the most is the complete ignoring of the previous part. None of what was presented in it was adequately addressed in the \\\"continuation\\\". And don`t get me started about the story with the Casino planet. I'm afraid for the fate of the next film of the saga.","true":true}
