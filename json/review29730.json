Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian \\\"Round Head\\\"  Johnson ruins a franchise by writing one dimensional characters and a terrible story. Then attacks the fan base for not liking the movie cuz they're biggots and sexist. No dude....your movie just sucks. There's been a ton of great movies well received with female and minority leads. How about Wonder Woman and Black Panther for some recent examples. I'd rather watch a three hour long Jar Jar movie with a migraine than watch this movie again.","true":true}
