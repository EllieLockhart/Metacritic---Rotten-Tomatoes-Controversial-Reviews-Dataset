Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute crap of a Star Wars movie. Is it an \\\"ok\\\" movie\\, yes\\, IF you didn't take into account there are 7 movies before this in the series to account for. The good is obviously the visuals\\, and that's about the only positive. The bad is the plot\\, the plot\\, the plot\\, and the mythos... and did I mention the plot? It makes about as much sense as a football bat. You will however love this movie if you believe the only way to have strong women in a movie is to make all the men retarded\/the bad guys. \\n\\nIn closing\\, I wouldn't piss on this dumpster to put out the fire.","true":true}
