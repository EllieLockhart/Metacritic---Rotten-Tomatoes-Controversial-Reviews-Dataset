Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i think this one is the most compelling and interesting story in star wars franchise. so many challenges comes upon in this film.. and i think overall it justified it perfectly. some twist are quite interesting but with incredible amount of loopholes.. still i think the whole story tells a journey.. and i believe there should be a new generation past skywalkers and it finally started it!! i think this is the new beginning and the upcoming movie with JJ directing will give us a perfect end... i liked it a lot!!","true":true}
