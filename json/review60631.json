So yes\\, the decisions they made regarding those characters hit us where it hurt.\rThat does not mean that the reasons for making this story came out of thin air.\rThe story and its decision gives this world a bleak outlook. Wich ads to the immersion of the world.\r\rGameplay feels more tight\\, but the aiming is still as blocky as the first game. You can opt for a auto aim setting if you like.\rThe dodge button works great and at times makes the fighting feel really cinamatic in al its bloddy glory.\rIt is brutal\\, it really is and i LOVE it. Reviewers judging that it is to real and make you feel sorry for taking a life is complete bs. Its a game and all the trailers prepares you for it. If you have a soft heart and cant handle it than dont play it after watching the trailer.\r\rGraphics and sound. My word they nailed it. The sound is so realistic\\, guns actually sound loud like a gun should. Wich most games fail to deliver.\rAnd the rain\\, wind and voices al sound so good. Especially with a surround headset.\r\rThis game got such an unfair score\\, both by users that hate the story decision and reviewers that gave it nothing but love.\rIts not a perfect game. At times the story is to drawn out. End the ending should have ended a couple of hours before the real ending. (you will know why if you play it)\rBut the gameplay\\, sound and graphics alone makes this game a solid 8.\rAnd if you feel like the gameplay is too repetative\\, than you yourself made it that way. The game gives you many ways to end that npc\\, fire\\, bullets\\, fists\\, arrows\\, bricks\\, knifes and al kinds of melee weapons. Not to mention you can stealthly take them out or go b*lls to the walls ham on people. Dont blame a game being repetative when you cant open your mind to other ways of play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
