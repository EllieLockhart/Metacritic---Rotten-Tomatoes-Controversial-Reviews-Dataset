Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand\\, under new ownership\\, the Star Wars Saga was to be revamped with the aim to seek new audience and gain interest from a new generation. My opinion of this movie is that this direction is at cost to all previous generations\\, those who'd enjoyed Star Wars for decades. Yes\\, there will be lots of positive reviews as I'm sure children will enjoy and the movie sets up for new ideas moving forward\\, but Star Wars: The Last Jedi certainly does not satisfy existing fans and actively destroys everything that the previous stories were created for. The Legacy is not to continue\\, fact. Star Wars is now new and purposely uninterested in historic popularity or hold any value as to why Star Wars grew so big. To anyone undecided\\, I would say watch this episode of the saga but with a view that it will leave a bad taste if you've seen any of the original movies. If you want much action\\, irrelevant short-lived characters\\, poor story with no larger picture to consider or have interest in\\, then this is for you. It does have some nice comedy moments\\, it does set up lots of merchandise ideas for your children\\, buts thats the only positives I can offer. It is a traditional Disney film\\, not traditional Star Wars\\, and actually I'lI expect future episodes to have music\\, dancing and singing too.","true":true}
