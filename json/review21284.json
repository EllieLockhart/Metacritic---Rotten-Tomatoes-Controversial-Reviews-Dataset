Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with high expectations\\,I came out puzzle and crushed.All of the built up storylines from TFA so poorly handled here.The plot twists were also poorly handled.\\n\\nThe First Order is treated like nothing more than a bunch of bumbling baffoons....This is the feared successor to the Empire?They were portrayed as a legitimate threat in the original trilogy.Here they are treated as a punch line.Why do we need an episode 9 with these easily defeated morons as the enemy?\\n\\nSnoke.....Why kill this character off so soon?Why not keep him around as a threat?I was really getting into his character and then he's just killed off.\\n\\nThis wasn't a \\\"bad\\\" movie\\,however it wasn't good either.Had they made a few different choices it couldve been a great film.Like why not have Luke fight Kylo Ren or Snoke for real?That would've been a bad ass way of closing out the film and Luke's story arch.....But what we got instead....Smh","true":true}
