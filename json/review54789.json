Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think its funny that people that liked the movie insist that the reason people hate it is it didnt give us what our desired theories. Really it was just a poor movie from a pacing and logic perspective. If there was no Force Awakens and no other Star Wars films ever\\, there would still have been idiotic characters in questionable positions of power\\, side quests that are nothing moremthan a vehicle to give characters something to do and logical inconsistencies within the same movie. Add into the mix the vast Star Wars universe canon that they decided to change and retcon\\, the movie is lucky to be getting two stars from me.\\n\\nAnd am I a bot? Well\\, no. But the 5 star reviews sure look like bots with many of them no longer than 8 words.","true":true}
