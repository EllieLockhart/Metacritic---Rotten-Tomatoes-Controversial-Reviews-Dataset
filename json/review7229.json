Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, but what they do with the old characters ( Han\\, Luke\\, Leia) leaves a lot to be desired. I don\u2019t like the direction the franchise is going. Easily could have made Luke a modern Yoda or something. But we are killing off the characters that MADE the franchise in ways that are borderline disrespectful! I can see Hans death to develop kylos character but I don\u2019t understand Luke\u2019s at all especially the way he went. Not a great movie ","true":true}
