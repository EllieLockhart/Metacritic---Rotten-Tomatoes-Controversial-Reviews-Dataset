Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was amazing\\, don't listen to the butt hurt reactions. As a movie alone it was solid\\, a bit slow in some parts but more than making up for it with a powerful climax that rocks you.\\nAs a Star Wars continuation\\, it goes in a different direction from the Extended Universe (Wasn't that the point of throwing out the material to begin with?)\\, which is fine because the Extended Universe did a fair amount of dumb out of character stuff. So they're starting from effectively Square 1 which is perfectly fine\\, setting up to rebuild the Star Wars Universe without... well... George Lucas being an idiot.","true":true}
