Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see that it's currently trendy to bash this movie because Luke did not live up to someone's 2-year long wet dream that he would train Rey and come back to fight with the Rebellion. Time will tell where this episode ranks in the saga - it's not the best but it's very far from the worse. This is a thinking person's Star Wars\\, the true fans will appreciate the depth of the characters and dialogue and actually pay attention to what they would otherwise miss in there\\, which there is a lot of.","true":true}
