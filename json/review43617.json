Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't Star Wars.  I am an old school fan and know Star Wars when I see  it\\, and this wasn't it.  Mary Poppins Leia\\, a casino with people in tuxedos\\, class warfare\\, \\\"Godspeed rebels\\\" from the purple haired Holdo\\, the list goes on.  This was worse than the prequels!  A sad day omsee what they've done to the most beloved franchise.","true":true}
