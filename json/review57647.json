Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To quote YouTube's Mauler\\, \\\"WTF?\\\"\\nI'm only a casual Star Wars fan\\, but even I'm aware that there is no coming back from this one. Killing off the most legendary and favorite Star Wars figure\\, while SIMULTANEOUSLY and miraculously and inexplicably saving his sister--the actress for which actually DID die in real life--means there is no reason to return for episode 9. It's like Disney thinks they can make back their $4 BILLION investment because people are interested to see if they can possibly find a way to do worse in the next film.\\nWas there even a discussion in editing about stopping the scene before Carrie Poppins god mode? It would have been a great deleted scene and a good way to let Fisher go. \\nNote to JJ Abrams...the Episode 9 trailer better START with a new\\, mysterious character rushing Rey off \\\"to meet her father\\\" at planet Not-Jakku. To which she says Kylo said her \\\"father was a drunk on Jakku\\,\\\" then the new character says\\, \\\"Why would you believe him!?\\\"\\nTIME TO PUSH THE RESET BUTTON ALREADY!","true":true}
