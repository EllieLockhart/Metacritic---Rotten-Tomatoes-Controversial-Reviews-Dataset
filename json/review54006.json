Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I buy the front row of premier seats for the first midnight showing of every Star Wars movie. So I had all my friends there ready to watch this. Solo was the first Star Wars movie I haven't seen on the first night since Return of the Jedi because of this movie\\, not a boycott\\, just apathy. This movie has damaged the magic that Star Wars had. I don't think it'll be easy to put the genie back in the bottle. We've seen behind the curtain\\, Star Wars is now lead by people who do not care about it at all. It's a plot hole filled mess. An insult to Star Wars fans. It's such a shame because this movie lost us the casual fans we need to keep Star Wars alive. I couldn't convince my casual Star Wars fan friends to see Solo\\, they simply didn't care anymore. \\n\\nWhy\\, why did they do this. Did nobody watch this movie before it launched. It isn't devisive\\, it's just bad. It is the best looking bad movie I've ever seen. \\n\\nSpace Mary Poppins\\, space Mary Poppins!","true":true}
