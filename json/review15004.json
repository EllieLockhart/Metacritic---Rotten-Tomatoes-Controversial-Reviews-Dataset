Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I knew Disney would mess up this franchise and they did. Hey Disney I do not accept your lame cannon. The Luke Skywalker I knew was not a coward on the run who only fights as a hologram.This movie sucks.","true":true}
