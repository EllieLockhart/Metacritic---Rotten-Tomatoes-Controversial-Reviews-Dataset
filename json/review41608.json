Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is good\\, different than what we're used to out of a Star Wars film\\, but this fresh revitalizing take is just what we needed. Even if a lot of the fandom's feather's have gotten ruffled\\, the critics agree that it's a great film and so do I. Put aside what you imagined Luke Skywalker did after ROTJ as a kid\\, and what you theorized coming out of the force awakens. Instead focus on this movie and it's characters as they grow through adversity. It's not perfect\\, no movie is. But surrounding a few minor issues is a great movie and a fresh look\\, feel\\, and pace. Deep meaning and symbolism paired with some of the most stunning and emotional visuals we have ever seen in Star Wars await you. Watch for yourself and feel the force!","true":true}
