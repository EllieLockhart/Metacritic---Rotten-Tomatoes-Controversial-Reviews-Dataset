Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of Star Wars\\, the Last Jedi was a disappointment compared to Rogue 1 and The Force Awakens. The plot dragged a bit and the ending was not so climactic. Spoiler alert - Do Not Read Beyond this if you have not watched movie....!!! The sinister Snoke who we saw as a formidable \u2018bad guy\u2019 was quickly wiped out with Kylo Ren using the Force to move a lightsaber counter clockwise and he (Snoke) did not sense this? After the Original trilogy of learning the force as a lifetime training is now a lesson of philosophy?! There are definite awesome fighter battles although it lacked climax and fights that we were used to. Would have preferred to have Luke battle it out with Snoke than to see him finish the battle in a hologram. ","true":true}
