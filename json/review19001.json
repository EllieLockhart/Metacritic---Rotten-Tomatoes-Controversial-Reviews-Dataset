Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's definitely the worst star wars film\\, I couldn't even finish it in one sitting. If it was an indie movie I would've rated it higher\\, but this is supposed to be an entry to the star wars saga yet it spits in the face of everything that came before it.  Like it wants to be its own thing\\, but it wants to benefit from having the star wars franchise audience.","true":true}
