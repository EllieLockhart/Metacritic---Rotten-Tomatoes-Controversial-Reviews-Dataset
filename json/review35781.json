Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is for the most part a well designed film\\, that completely ignores the fan service demands of the masses in order to tell it's own story. A deeper dive into the more human aspects of the realm itself as well as a more human perspective on what a galactic war truly means. But the biggest surprise? A complete reversal on a theme that has been enigmatic through every Star Wars film with the ironic exception of Rogue One. Destiny.\\n\\nSimply put\\, these characters aren't drenched in the idea of fate like other Star Wars protagonists and antagonists. I would even go as far as to say the rejection of this as a defining character motive\\, one might say a rebellion against it\\, is a major theme of the story. Something which on it's face seem antithetical to the franchise itself\\, but works perfectly in this story if you just follow Luke Skywalker's advice\\, and breathe. Just.. breathe.\\n\\nOn the negative side\\, there were a couple of odd\/awkward scenes and pieces of dialog that seemed much too meta\\, and were jarring enough to momentarily pull viewers out of the story. There were also many plot points from the previous installment that seemingly could have been addressed in the 2 HOUR 30 MINUTE run time\\, that were either simply ignored or abruptly settled anticlimactically. But the latter doesn't hinder the story being told as much as leave an overall feeling of dissatisfaction in it's afterglow and put an awkward amount of pressure on PART 9 and it's director J.J. Abrams to deliver on these promises when the final installment of THIS trilogy is completed two years from now.\\n\\nFINAL JUDGMENT: The force is strong with this story\\, it's director's vision\\, and the talent of it's ensemble cast. It's by no way perfect\\, but as a movie on it's own it shines. As part of a larger saga with a very strong lineage and on the heals of high expectations left in the wake of it's last installment however.. it is a black sheep that may leave some superfans wanting much much more. But as someone who can enjoy a film on it's own merits\\, if you are like me\\, I would recommend it.","true":true}
