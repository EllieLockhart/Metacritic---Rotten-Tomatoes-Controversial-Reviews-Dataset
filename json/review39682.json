Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a derivative\\, uninteresting\\, politically driven hollow of what Star Wars used to be. The characters are written lazily and Rian Johnson's complete disregard for the legacy of Star Wars permeates the entire film.","true":true}
