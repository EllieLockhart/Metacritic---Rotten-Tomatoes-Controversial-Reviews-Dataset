Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly\\, everyone has an opinion on The Last Jedi. I enjoyed it. I was in my early 20s when the original Star Wars Trilogy came out. I remember the reviews then\\, and it's hilarious that people put so much weight to what some stranger says\\, myself included. I was glad to see Luke up there again\\, period.","true":true}
