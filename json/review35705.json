Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a Triumph of modern filmmaking. It is one of the best Star Wars films to date every issue that addresses is done so the storyline will progress is not bogged down with trying to Fan please which is a great thing it takes the force and Star Wars into new and exciting directions this movie truly shows that Star Wars is everlasting.","true":true}
