Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad to see the franchise destroyed in this latest victim of the SJW movement. All preceding films and characters are reduced to meaningless non-entities. Yes we know Hollywood\\, we're all special and being rich and powerful is bad. The fact that this message comes from the exact people in society who are a special caste and are the gluttons and aristocracy of our day makes it all the more hypocritical.","true":true}
