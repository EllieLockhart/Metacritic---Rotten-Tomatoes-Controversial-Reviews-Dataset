Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account because after being labeled everything under the sun. Bot\\,Sexist\\,Fan Boy etc i\u2019ve had enough! This film was not good. It was horrible. In fact it was cheap story telling. And i\u2019m done with Kathleen Kennedy\u2019s Star Wars. Let me know when they let her go. ","true":true}
