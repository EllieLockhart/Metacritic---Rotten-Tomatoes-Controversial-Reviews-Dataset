Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe I\u2019m being a bit harsh\\, but honestly I was really disappointed. It also surprised me\\, because every pre-release review was \u201camazing\u201d\\, \u201cfantastic\u201d\\, yada yada\\, so I thought maybe it was just me. Then I went on FB after the movie and went straight to the comments section of some Star Wars related posts... seems about half of people love it and think it\u2019s the best movie since Empire\\, and the other half hated. It\u2019s definitely a polarizing film. I need to watch again\\, maybe I was tired or not in the right mood\\, but I think it was definitely the worst of the Disney SW films... Barely better than the prequels. And that\u2019s only because the prequels were frustrating and annoying\\, this one wasn\u2019t \u201cfrustrating and annoying\u201d\\, it just sucked. I mean\\, some stuff was good\\, but that\u2019s it. \u201cSome stuff\u201d. Same with the prequels. Some characters and locations\\, some battles\\, etc were good\\, but overall\\, not. Not impressed with Rian Johnson for SW. I felt the primary plot line was weak and boring\\, and did little to advance the saga. The dialogue was scattered\\, much of the humor fell flat\\, holes in the plot were patched with thoughtless fixes\\, many of the reveals were incredibly lackluster\\, and the ending was anticlimactic. Just couldn\u2019t get into this one at all. ","true":true}
