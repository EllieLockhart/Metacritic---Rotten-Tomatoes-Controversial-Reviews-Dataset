Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\\nI have now seen this film three times: with my younger brothers (11 & 14)\\, with my parents (late 40s) and with my girlfriend (21). All of us loved it and it got better every viewing. The action was exciting\\, the cinematography was beautiful\\, the humour was funny (a lot of complaints about this\\, I didn't find it to be the case at all)\\, and the story continued the journey well.\\n\\nMany complaints are about Luke's character\\, I found him to be engaging\\, more so than the original trilogy in which he was relatively boring character-wise. He is different\\, but why is that a surprise considering all that has happened? All of the characters have been progressed and enriched by this film. The plot holes are easily explained and are no more significant than in any of the other films.\\n\\nTo conclude\\, The Last Jedi was a thrilling ride from beginning to end\\, moving the Star Wars universe forward in an unexpected\\, but necessary\\, direction. Everyone I've spoken to loved it\\, don't dwell too much on internet opinions. One minor qualm is that a subplot was extended dragged on slightly\\, but aside from that\\, it was great.","true":true}
