Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing. As a huge Star Wars fan (EU included)\\, I always try to have high hopes.  I wasn't the biggest Force Awakens fan\\, but I understood why they choose the story they did and I like Rey's character (and Finn's and Kylo's\\, for that matter). \\n\\nThis movie was SO SLOW. The pacing was downright awful. The first payoff of any kind happened about 90 minutes in. Too long! The side stories were myriad and I found myself trying to figure out what to care about. When things finally started to get interesting and a few payoffs seen\\, I was tired. They could've trimmed 30-40 minutes out of this movie and made it better.\\n\\nHere's hoping for Episode IX... or SOLO\\, for that matter.","true":true}
