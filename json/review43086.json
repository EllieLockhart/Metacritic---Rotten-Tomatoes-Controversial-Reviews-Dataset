Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This new version of the 'Star Wars' saga is absolute garbage. The story continues to take a backseat to push identity politics\\, which is why the plot\\, characters\\, & story are all over the place in trying to format this messaging. The story & continuity makes no sense. The characters are awful. The writing is incredibly lazy. The only redeeming quality of this film is the visual effects. The story & plot is crap. I could have written a better and more deserving story\\, of this beloved franchise\\, in a few hours than the load of tripe this film took months to deliver. ","true":true}
