Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slightly more original than the Force Awakens but still ripping whole scenes from earlier movies. Once again I like the characters\/cast but their story is just lacking. It's like Disney doesn't have a plan but they have to start making their 4 billion back\\, it's like they want to hit all the notes from the earlier trilogies but they're tone deaf. NOT a horrible move just not great. A solid Meh.","true":true}
