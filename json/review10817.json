Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hard to understand the decisions Rian Johnson took for key characters such as Luke and Leia\\, as it ruined what should have been spectacular conclusions to their stories and instead made them both seem feeble and unimportant. The way the First Order is shown as bumbling fools instead of scary and efficient antagonists also does the story no favors. Overall\\, a very disappointing movie in so many ways for the hard core fan\\, especially considering how much high praise this director was given leading up to this release.","true":true}
