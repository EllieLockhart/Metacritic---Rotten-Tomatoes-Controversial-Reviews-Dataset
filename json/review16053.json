Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm all few new directions but not for destroying an entire saga because you can't come up with a decent plot. It's a 2 and half hour version of the famous SNL skit where Shatner lectures Star Trek nerds to get a life. This is not a good film by any measure. It's boring\\, unoriginal\\, preachy\\, ham-handed\\, and insulting to the audience. I hope there are protest marches at Disneyworld and Rian Johnson comes nowhere near another Star Wars film. Don't even let him near the Star War section at Toys 'R Us. It's bad... real bad.","true":true}
