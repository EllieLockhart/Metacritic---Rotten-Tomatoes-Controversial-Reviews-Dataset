Yes the art and music is fantastic (when it's not being ripped from a different creator without credit)\\, however the story itself and the murder (both figuratively and literally) of beloved characters is just terrible. Let's start easy. Joel was **** in this game. They changed his entire way of thinking in order to get him in the position for Abby to kill him. Remember back when Joel got mad at Ellie for using her real name when they met Sam and Henry? Yeah none of that comes to play when he gladly gives his name to Susan Strong... Ehem I mean Abby. Next\\, the massive plot armor that Dina AKA \\\"The Nose\\\" and Abby have. It's beyond unreal. There is a scene in the game where The Nose shoots someone and then falls through a window. The other enemy holsters his weapon and goes over to strangle her instead of shooting her. There is no reason for this aside from giving Ellie a chance to stab him. The same thing with Abby surviving all those infected and somehow Joel showing up to save her. Even worse is the scene of Abby killing Joel when Ellie walks in. She stands and watches for many seconds. This isn't what her character would do. We saw it plain and simple when she saved Joel's life in the hotel in the first game. They even reference it in this piece of garbage but for some reason she can't rely on those lighting reflexes when Hulk Hogana... Ehem I mean Abby\\, is at the end of the barrel. The writing in this game is lazy at best and just plain stupid at worse. Another nitpick of mine is that this is not a romance game. Never was never will be. This game is about survival and the (very sloppy) romance that the writers try to add in doesn't help the game at all. It makes it feel rushed and unfinished. Much like the rest of the game. The story and plot armor aside the mechanics have not really improved. You can dodge\\, you can lie down\\, and She Rah... Ehem I mean Abby\\, can break your neck like a toothpick. That is the only improvement to the mechanics. It's still  just the same animations over and over throughout this empty world and with a story that can't even hold itself together without pulling a GoT \\\"let's kill beloved characters\\\" it doesn't work.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
