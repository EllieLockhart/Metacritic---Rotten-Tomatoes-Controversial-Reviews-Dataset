Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My post on Rotten Tomatoes. I gave it one star out five. \\n\\n   Disney has found their greatest platform upon to stand and wave their banner of leftist\\, feminism rich\\, anti-everything masculine and anything to do with the true story of Star Wars. \\n   Ryan Johnson is a yes man to the true villian of the galaxy in Kathleen Kennedy and was rewarded for his destruction of the franchise with a new trilogy for his loyalty and his deplorable script and nothing short of a parody that slaps Star Wars fans in the face. \\n   Ryan Johnson you are no friend of Star Wars and no friend to the Star Wars fan base. It is clear and undeniable\\, in my opinion\\, that little Ryan was tasked with destroying roying the film\\, the story\\, potentially the franchise and did so I with extreme predjudice. \\n   The franchise is dead in the hands of Disney as far as I'm concerned. It would take two more films minimum written and directed by Gareth Edwards with no interference\\, rewrites\\, and reshoots to put this scattered story back together and put the WAR back into Star Wars and squeeze the story free of every last drop of the political venom that little Ryan and his momma (Kennedy) has had injected into and poisoned the story and soured the most dedicated fans.","true":true}
