For me this game gets a 8 \/10\\,it wasn't perfect and it's really different from the last game in terms of narrative\\, they wanted to change the story and it didn't succeed as they wanted but I didn't find the story bad\\,just average but all the other elements are a 10 \/10\\, this game doesn't deserve the review bombing it gets\\, I understand if you wanted a different story but rating this 0\/10 is just pathetic. I rate this 10 on metacritic to help with the review bombing\u2026 Expand","true":true}
