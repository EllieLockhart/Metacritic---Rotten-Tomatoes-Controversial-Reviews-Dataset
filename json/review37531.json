Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There a tons of plot holes\\, reused material\\, and Marry Sue characters. Mark Hamil delivers really well on his acting\\, unfortunately the movie entirely disregard everything we've known of his character up until this point to fit with Lucasart's SJW agenda. \\n\\nDont see it.","true":true}
