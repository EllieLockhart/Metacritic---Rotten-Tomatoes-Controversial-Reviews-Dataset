Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came out of this viewing a little confused and a little uncomfortable. After sleeping on it and discussing it with friends I've come to believe TLJ shares more in common with Mel Brooks' Spaceballs than any other film in the Star Wars collection. One error of judgement I can forgive\\, but there were at least half a dozen moments that felt out of place and incredibly misguided. Other than Ridley\\, none of the characters established in TFA were allowed to shine. Poe came across as brash and gung-ho\\, a loose canon but in the worst possible way. Finn was given a weak subplot that went nowhere\\, and Luke seems to have become a complete arsehole\\, who cheats at being a Jedi! So so sad and disappointed. I won't be buying this when it comes out\\, and that's a bad sign for me.","true":true}
