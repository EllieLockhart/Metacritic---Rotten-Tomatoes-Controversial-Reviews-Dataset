Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before reading this please note that there is a possibility of spoilers\\, and I do not wish to ruin the movie for anyone intending to see it. That said\\, here goes. \\n\\nStar Wars the last Jedi was an unmitigated disaster\\, the film had me an hour into it feeling as though I wanted to check my phone. (An experience I did not have in Thor Ragnarok\\, The Hateful 8\\, or several other longer showtime films.) This in itself was a huge disappointment\\, as I sat there\\, gazing up at what I had spent months hoping would be something that would bring delight and joy\\, instead turned into a mournful encounter. \\\"The hero's are useless.\\\" Is the overall theme of the entire first 2 acts of the movie. Culminating into a final showdown in the 3rd act where we see some semblance of the main characters getting their act together.\\n\\nThe Dialogue felt forced\\, the kiss felt forced\\, the deaths felt forced. Nothing felt like it was supposed to happen. Everything about this movie felt as though it was being pushed.\\n\\nAll in all\\, I was severely disappointed and am saddened by the direction this film took the star wars universe. I can only hope that we have a serious change\\, come episode IX.","true":true}
