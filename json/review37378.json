Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The primary plot with Rey\\, Luke and kylo is just about perfect\\,. The secondary plot with the escaping rebel fleet is ok\\, third subplot with fin and Rose is no good and borderline train wreck\\, but the primary story makes up for it so it still gets four stars.  Listen to the professional critics not the super fans that held it to unrealistic expectations","true":true}
