{"101487":173594,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The blatant copying\/recycling of scenes from Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back is an insult to our intelligence as fans.  We gave a pass to TFA for it's recycling (Starkiller) and similarities in plot to A New Hope\\, but this was taken to another level in TLJ.  Seriously Rian Johnson\\, where's your originality.  Pointless plot\\, did nothing to advance the story.  Lots of cheesy scenes\\, bad attempts at humor\\, too many predictable\\, cliched deux ex machina moments\\, botched characters (Benicio del Toro?)\\, etc.\\, etc..  I could go on and on.  The movie could've been 1 1\/2 hours long instead of 2 1\/2 and nothing would have been lost.  Destroyed all the momentum The Force Awakens had gained.  Why was it Rian's decision to determine who Rey's parents are\\, as he has explained in interviews (not that I care much who they are or aren't)?  Is this story being made up as we go along? If this is the case\\, then Disney may be partly to blame for not having a preconceived story for the entire trilogy for directors to follow and adhere to.  The lack of cohesion with TFA is evident.  Please JJ\\, save us from this disaster in Episode 9!","true":true}
