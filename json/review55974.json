Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined Legacy characters.  Deliberately followed Han being a run away father with Luke being a failed burnout. Hamill was right to say that he didn't approve\\, nor does this make sense --this is not the Luke we knew. Pacing\\, plot\\, Dialogue all dull\\, with little to no motivation or character development. No intensity\\, no real stakes\\, or memorable lines\\, wasted new characters\\, and huge reset with a major slap in the face to what made Star Wars what it is without really knowing that what it hoped to \\\"fix\\\" was already long a part of the old cannon. So far none of the major characters in the past have been given a proper in character send off. It's a big never mind the older generation\\, the newer one if better\\, less fearful\\, more balanced\\, and the true heroes that the Galaxy needs. The older ones just need to die off\\, \\\"kill them if you must\\\" so room can be made for newer characters. Your daddy's star wars was \\\"lame\\\" and ineffectual is the message. Buy into the newer\\, far stronger\\, characters. Puns where badly timed and not funny.  Given what has been said in the press by those in charge they did not take seriously the promises given to the FANS or to Lucas.  Because of all this and more this IS the worst so far of all the films.","true":true}
