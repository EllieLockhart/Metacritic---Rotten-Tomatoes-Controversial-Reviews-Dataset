Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney continues to take away from the seriousness the the original series had. This movie is about war and good versus evil\\, but every time it's start to feel serious another corny joke is thrown out. Fin is the jar jar binks of this series.","true":true}
