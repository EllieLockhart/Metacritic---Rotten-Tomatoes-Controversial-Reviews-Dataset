Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful\\, impeccable look where every scene and frame is made to impress and impress\\, the landscapes are beautiful\\, the visual care is perfect. As for the story tried to deepen the new characters after \\\"the force awakens\\\" and succeeded. Inserting new characters also works. Rose fits well in this new phase ... to demonstrate the courage and bravery of those who do not have \\\"the force\\\" .. of those who do not have a legitimate hierarchy of power search\\, are ordinary people fighting for survival and peace\\, and this helps to be seen on the screen ... puts you inside the story. It works for me. The Kylo \/ Rey relationship narrows and insinuates the indecisiveness of both sides which way to go and this generates a lot of tension in well-constructed scenes. Adam Driver can be Kylo at the same time insecure\\, dissimulated\\, cold and angry\\, but it is not Vadder and I do not see it as something negative\\, new times new villains\\, new types of psychopaths. The metaphorical passage of Saber continues\\, the relationship Luke and Rey resemble what was once seen in the franchise but here Luke is reluctant to pass the Jedi precepts..qualified by failure and neglect with his nephew. And this leads to good scenes both with Rey ... while others in which the past visits him to walk again with the rebels. The movie walks fast and nostalgic\\, the scenes with Carrie thrill for everything that happened ... but without the loaded humbug ... it's just simple and beautiful. The film carries the visual beauty but also the emotional one that sticks to you in the chair\\, which makes you feel excited to experience this fable again .. maybe here it fails because it is not so round\\, as in \\\"the force awakens\\\" bring new elements\\, still takes many and many fans to theaters. Be the ancients behind any small reference that takes you back to the original trilogy with its remarkable moments. Like the new ones who seem to respect what's been done before\\, but look forward to how the very talented film Rian Johnson does. Great !!","true":true}
