Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson missed the entire point of the Star Wars movies. Completely failed to connect force awakens and  to last Jedi. And at any point that should have been a highly climatic point in the movie is met with huge disappointments. There is no excitement to see the next one","true":true}
