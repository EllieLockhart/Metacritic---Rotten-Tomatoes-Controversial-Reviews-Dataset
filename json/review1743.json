Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan from the beginning I thought the plot was lacking direction and especially didn't like the characterization- the depiction of Luke Skywalker was not accurate to the franchise- the ultimate hero who was going to sacrifice himself to save his father now has a momentary contemplation of killing his nephew??","true":true}
