Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came in with some moderately high expectations\\, and had the unusual experience of those not being on base\\, and me being pleased with the results. As a piece of engaging entertainment\\, and a story with stakes and ideas I could get into\\, I had a surprisingly good time\\, and was more engaged than I expected. I now care about Kylo Ren in a way I didn't in the first movie\\, and the rebellion has become more than a mere background assumption and a few murky sets.\\nI may need to re-watch\\, to figure out if I can make any more sense of one character's command decisions\\, but I can invent a small paranoia to explain it\\, and it's the only story flaw that stood out (being cautious of spoilers here).\\nI had such a simply good time on the face of it\\, I'm at a loss as to the cause of the hate brigade; only a small portion of it seems political\\, at least directly\\, which is sad noise that I can filter out. I'm not seeing things that make sense to the film I saw\\, at lest as a source of hate\\, yet.\\nI didn't even mind the pacing at all. It progressed every segment significantly with every scene. My time and attention were not wasted. I wasn't in a rush to get anywhere\\, which seems to be what had other people complaining? Where\\, for goodness sakes? The story was doing something at every moment\\, if you just watch\\, from what I could see.\\nBut in any case\\, I was delighted\\, and am more of a fan of Star Wars than I was before I saw this.","true":true}
