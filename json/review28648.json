Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: \\n-Space battles are freaking awesome!\\n\\nCons: \\n-Directionless\\n-Plot holes\\, Ye gods the plot holes that a three year old would notice\\n-Lore\/Information given from The Force Awakes is tossed aside like trash\\n-Some acting is plain awful\\n-There was about thirty seconds of light-saber action in the entire film with 0 Jedi vs Sith battles.\\n-Boring\\, in a 2hr 30 min starwars movie there is about fifteen minutes of action\\n-Bad jokes and out of place humor that had about three people in a packed theater snickering\\n-Pointless fluffy critters to promote merchandise sales","true":true}
