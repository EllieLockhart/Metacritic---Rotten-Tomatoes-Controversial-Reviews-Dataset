Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is pure garbage and trash. They had a full cast of SJW's and liberal art feminists. Every one in charge is a woman\\, the only good main character is black\\, all of the white men are shown as \\\"the devil\\\" or impotent like luke. What the crack? Snoke? Plot lines? Any cracking person who knows something about any type of combat... I mean 150 million dollars and they couldn'd find a fod damn cracking ex-military colonel to make all of the battles AT LEAST reasonable? At least LEAST LEAST STAR_WARS GRADE reasonable? Snoke\\, for cracks sake... what up with him? This is utter crap.","true":true}
