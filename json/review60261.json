There! I said it! The fact that his death was so abrupt and unceremonious makes  the flashback scenes and the fact that Ellie didnt get to forgive him all the more tragic. Abby is a great character that I liked and rooted for not because her killing Joel is justified by the fact that he killed her father but because playing the game you get to experience her arc from being a traumatized ruthless killer with tribalistic ethics to becoming a friend and a mother figure to a kid who she thought was the enemy. She was lost in the darkness and she searched for the light(like the Firefly motto goes)\\, the light her dad represented\\, the light he found with Lev. To the people who hate the ending because Ellie doesnt kill Abby: Are you seriously saying that all the other killings were pointless because she didnt kill Abby? The theme of the story was about learning to let go and stop holding on to hate. The point of it all was not  \\\"Good guy kill bad guy\\\" but  for Ellie to finally let go of the hate that destroyed all of these lives\\, the hate  Abby also had for Joel and that ultimately  lead to the death of all her friends. Hate\\, eve if  its justifiable\\, will only destroy you and turn you into the monster you were fighting against. The best thing you can do is to let go and forgive even the most unforgivable acts. Just think about how much better things would be if Ellie hadnt walked down that path of vengeance. Think how better things would be if she had forgiven Joel earlier. She was too late on forgiving Joel but not Abby. If she had killed her she would be forever lost in the darkness and there would be no turning back. With that last act of forgiveness she just barely saved herself. By the end of the story Ellie knew the cost of resisting forgiveness. By learning to forgive Abby she finally forgave Joel. Even if it was too late  its was nice knowing that the last time they spoke to each other she gave him hope that one day she would finally learn to forgive him. That day tragically never came for him but he died hoping and in the bleak world of The Last of Us you take what you can get.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
