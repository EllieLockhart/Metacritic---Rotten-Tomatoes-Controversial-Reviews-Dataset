Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This felt like they were dragging out the story\\, nothing new happened.  No victories or losses really.  I usually love JJ Abrams but this was a major disappointment.  Not sure who the writers were but how could they finish this and say \\\"ah-ha\\, yes that's exciting.\\\"","true":true}
