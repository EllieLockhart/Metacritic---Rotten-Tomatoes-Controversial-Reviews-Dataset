Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I regret paying money to see this.  Kathleen should be ashamed of herself.  You gave Rian a whole trilogy after this fiasco?  He must have executed Order 66 to your liking.  Way to take a modern myth and turn it into every other ho hum franchise\\n\\nI see a lot of people calling out negative reviews as trolls.  We are not trolls\\, just dissatisfied customers with opinions.  Are the gushers paid Disney employees or fanboys that can't comprehend that their favorite franchise has cr@pped the bed this time?","true":true}
