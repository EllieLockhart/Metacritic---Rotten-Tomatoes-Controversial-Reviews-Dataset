Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed bag of great visuals\\, bad script\\, and controversial character development. I found it a relatively poor follow-up to The Force Awakens\\, undoing a lot of the set-ups made in the previous film and going out of its way to surprise you in the most illogical ways it can\\, but it does have great moments and thrilling action.","true":true}
