Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After DC\\, Star Wars to be another franchise where there is a stark contrast between critics and audiences. Really came out of the cinema disappointed. Not the movie I wanted. Not worth the time and money.","true":true}
