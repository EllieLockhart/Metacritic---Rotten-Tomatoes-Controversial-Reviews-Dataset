Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an odd beast for the Star Wars series: a direct sequel with no time lapse\\, and a movie where whatever your expectations are\\, forget them on the way in.  On first viewing\\, there were things that I loved\\, and things that\\, as a Star Wars nerd\\, I was peeved by.  On second viewing it all became clearer\\, making The Last Jedi a much better film.  It lacks the thrill-a-minute blast that was The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jedi's utter refusal to play things straight and challenge everything that we knew about the Force and the galaxy far far away makes it a stronger film overall.  Sure\\, 90% of its set pieces are recycled from the original trilogy (as it was in TFA)\\, but this trilogy\\, as the OT\\, is a hero's journey\\, so there will always be a familiarity to source material. (The Hero's Journey is the most prevalent of storylines in fiction.). When it comes down to it\\, I believe the backlash will recede in time\\, as we've begun to see for the Prequels","true":true}
