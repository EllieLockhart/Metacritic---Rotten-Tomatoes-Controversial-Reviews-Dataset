Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic\\, best of the Star Wars movies.  Action scenes were fantastic.  And really liked that they didn't take the easy way out with the characters.  Complex and thoughtful way they handled Luke.  Can't wait to see where they take it from here!","true":true}
