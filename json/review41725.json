Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not what I was expecting at all\\, but I'm okay with that. It was surprising and kept me guessing\\, which isn't an easy thing. It wasn't perfect\\, and it certainly was not Empire Strikes Back\\, but it didn't need to be. The character driven moments were amazing\\, and there was some real development in the characters. There were a few things that bothered me\\, like the absolute waste of a character that is Captain Phasma\\, but for the most part I was happy with the general theme of failure and learning from mistakes. There were also some absolutely gorgeous shots\\, and the entire fill was visually stunning. It throws out a lot of the Legends continuity\\, but I'm okay with that. That was always expected\\, and I can't wait to see where this series goes.","true":true}
