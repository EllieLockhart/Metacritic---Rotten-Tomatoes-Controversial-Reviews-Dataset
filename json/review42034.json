Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes a statement of the political ideology of its writer but he alienates many with the poor treatment of its most beloved characters. We previously had to endure this with Han Solo and now Luke Skywalker. The misguided\\, impotent Finn is another victim of this. One doesn't have to diminish a sex or race to elevate the other but in today's liberal extremist environment it does.","true":true}
