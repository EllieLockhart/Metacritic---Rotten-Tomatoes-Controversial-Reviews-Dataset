Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect movie - nothing is - but I highly enjoyed Mark Hamill\\, the Porgs weren't the new Jar Jar but instead were just there to sell the kids a few toys\\, and it led us in a new direction that Star Wars movies haven't seen before. Initial kneejerk reactions may leave some confused\\, I personally was still processing my feelings two days later. But all in all\\, it's a good middle movie that makes me both confused and excited to see what comes next in episode 9.","true":true}
