Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold risks elevate the film to directions that have never been seen before in this universe\\, couple that with the heart and drive of all the characters and it makes for one of the best Star Wars Movies\\, as well as a movie of the year consideration.","true":true}
