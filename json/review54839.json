Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is nearly impossible to please everybody. Especially with one of the most beloved movie franchises in the history of film. So many overly critical wannabe screenwriters trashing this movie. Here's the truth. This movie isn't what I expected. There are many things that could have been done differently. Some things that could have been done better. However\\, this movie really does make a nice addition to the franchise. The audio and CGI in this movie are top notch as you would expect from a Star Wars film. One of the things this movie really delivers on\\, is the reality of what the resistance is. During a revolution\\, there are many casualties of war. But hope\\, and ideas are something that can't be defeated. Which was done very well in rogue one. I also really enjoyed the conflict within both aren't and Ben solo. The tone of this movie was dark enough to satisfy me\\, but light hearted enough with sufficient comic relief to keep the tone of the movie balanced. Overall\\, a solid movie. Don't listen to the salty critics who can't be entertained","true":true}
