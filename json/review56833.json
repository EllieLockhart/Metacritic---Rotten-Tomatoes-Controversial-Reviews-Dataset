Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some good things going on in this movie but I am giving it a one star for really one reason\\, but it is an important reason. I like Rian Johnson and I really enjoyed Looper. You can see he had themes here he wanted to explore. \\nBut this isn't just his film. There are a lot of fans that are invested in this series. There is real attachment to characters like Luke Skywalker. There is real attachment to questions that were posed in the first film. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? Why did Luke leave that map to himself? \\nThis movie says\\, \\\"screw all your expectations\\, I'm doing my own thing.\\\" \\nIf you are not a fan of Star Wars you may enjoy this movie\\, despite some odd seeming plot holes. If you are someone who feels invested in this universe you'll probably still see this movie but you might be disappointed with some of the decisions and abandoned subplots.","true":true}
