Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan since the original film\\, I wanted to love this film. I only liked it. I felt like a small bit of my childhood has been killed off with these new movies. I prefer the continuity of the older novels and the Dark Horse comics to be totally honest. Not excited for episode 9 at all.","true":true}
