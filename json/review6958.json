{"101487":117629,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the Top 5 movies in the franchise!\\n\\nNOTE: I am purposely trying to minimize spoilers in this review\\, however there are some references to specific pieces of the movie that could qualify as spoilers to some people who have not watched the movie. Please continue with caution if you don't want any preconception of the content of The Last Jedi.\\n\\nFirst\\, to deal with some of the controversies: \\n - I would have liked to see Carrie's death dealt with in this movie. There was at least one major opportunity to have Leia die in a significant scene. We could have avoided some controversy by changing this scene.\\n - The slow speed space chase wasn't as suspenseful as it could (or should) have been. But it was explained sufficiently within the movie itself. People may not like the explanation\\, but it still works to move the story forward (although slowly).\\n - Luke is a broken hero through most of the movie. I would have liked to see him come around a little quicker and to play a bigger part\\, but I can also see the larger vision for this trilogy and the new generation of hero's are being put in place to carry the franchise forward. Time to change Luke's role in this saga. I fully expect that he will contribute to the story in Ep IX.\\n - Rey's lineage was foreshadowed nicely in The Force Awakens. From the movie title itself\\, to Maz's scene with Rey\\, and Han & Leia's scenes with Rey. Take away all of the fan theories and re-watch TFA with the perspective of TLJ's revelation\\, and I think everything fits together very nicely.\\n - I would like to know more about Snoke\\, but feel like we know enough at this point. He's an extremely powerful dark force user who rose to power in the vacuum of leadership following TFA. I hope that we learn more about him in other story arcs\\, but as far as this story goes\\, he is explained well enough.\\n\\nThere is very clearly a theme that runs through the movie concerning arrogance. From Luke\\, to Poe\\, to Hux\\, Snoke\\, and Kylo\\, arrogance leads to some major mistakes in judgement. This flows through even the discussion that Yoda has with Luke. The old Jedi order fell prey to it as well. The story writing brilliantly threads this theme across all of the subplots of the movie.\\n\\nRey is quickly becoming a leader herself. Up to this point\\, she's been trying to search out who she is\\, where she comes from\\, and what her place is in this whole thing. She even asks Luke to help show her where she fits in. By the end of the movie\\, she has decided where she fits in and now she is learning what her role is in helping to defeat the evil that is taking over so much of the galaxy.\\n\\nIn my opinion\\, TFA and TLJ have surpassed all of my hopes and expectations for the franchise. The let down I experienced with the prequels has been reversed here. Lucasfilm is going a much better direction\\, and is making far better movies than anything we've had in the last 20 years. I'm excited for the release of Episode IX and the continuance of this saga.","true":true}
