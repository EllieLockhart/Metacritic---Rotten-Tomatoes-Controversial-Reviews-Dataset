Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"After 24 hours I finally completed the game and I must say it's just as good if not better than the first game. My only complaints is that maybe you play as Abby for a little too long and gameplay got monotonous\\, specially on day 2. I understand that some people dislike the choices the writers made but I think they pulled it off in a way I didn't expect\\, I even played the game having read a lot of spoilers but that didn't take anything away from me because I believe you really have to experience this game and play it for yourself till the end to understand the choices the characters made.\r\rI see some people say that they don't like the game because they don't like abby\\, but in my opinion the game doesn't really try to make you like her\\, they make you see that her motives are just as valid as Ellie's for doing what she did and puts thing in a different perspective\\, and to be honest Abby has some of the most intense and fun parts of the game.\r\rMy only issues with the story are Abby's motivations to save Lev and his sister and MAYBE some issues with it's structure\\, it may have been better to mix up playing as Abby and Ellie a little more but\\, I get why they didn't do that but still. When seeing Abby's side of the story I really liked all the new characters they introduced and they all felt so fleshed out\\, specially Owen\\, I even felt terrible because I already knew what Ellie did to them (this is why I think the game is structured how it is).\r\rNot to mention gameplay was fun and devastating as **** it's the best looking game ever\\, the soundtrack is so beautiful and push the important moments of the story and the environments have so much detail and love put into them.\r\rMy expectations with this game were as high as they come and it met them. I do feel really sad for how divided the fan base will be now and I really wished everyone enjoyed this game as much as I did\\, but come on people\\, it's not even close to a 0.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
