Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is\\, and i say this with all sincerity\\, an absolute slap in the face to long time Star Wars fans. Horrible writing\\, horrible plot\\, bland characters\\, and the complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker.  It feels like a blatant and purposeful execution of all things from the original Lucas made films. It seems incredibly mean spirited and deliberate. Don't waste your time on this one.","true":true}
