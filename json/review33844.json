Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible on carrying on the storylines and characters. Multiple plot holes and parts that ruin the lore of previous saga films. \\n\\nThe trilogy story seems to have stalled and there's not a lot to look forward to for Ep 9. \\n\\nSuch a shame. This movie and trilogy have so much set up with new stories and characters that the Star Wars fan base wanted to know more about and they got nothing.","true":true}
