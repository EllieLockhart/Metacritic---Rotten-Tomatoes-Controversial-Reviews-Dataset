Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It covered the range from great effects\\, action\\, humor\\, touching moments and surprises. Yes\\, there  were a few things that could have been done better or tightened up a bit but what film doesn't have some flaws? This segment in the saga again explored the pull of the dark side and and how enticing power can be versus using the force for good and altruistic purposes. Is the strength of the force within a person due to lineage or can it be found in anyone regardless of parentage or station? Old and new fans need to remember that the Skywalkers were not the only powerful Jedi. Although I felt great sadness with the passing of such huge figures\\, how can the Force continue without new youngsters with the \\\"gift?\\\"","true":true}
