Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst SW ever....\\nI thought they won't create spacenazi characters.... The uniform is exactly the same. And not those characters were the only problem.. OMG. Soooo terrible\\, so trite.\\nThe plot had more potential\\, but they did not use it.... The view was amazing of course\\, but it is not a Star Wars movie. Its something completely different....","true":true}
