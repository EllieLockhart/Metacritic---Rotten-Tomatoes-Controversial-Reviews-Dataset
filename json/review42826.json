Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't as good as TFA\\, by not answering the questions about Reys parentage\\, or why she's so strong with the force leaves a bad taste. Also all powerful snoke is killed to easily. Leia doing a superman. Luke is completely wasted. Finn and Rose waste of screen time. Too many holes in plot. Just a disaster. Not sure how critics can rate it so highly. JJ Abrams should've directed this for continuity sake.","true":true}
