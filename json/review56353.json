Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie\\, but the bigger issue I have is the backlash to the fans that are perpetuating the backlash to the film.  I've heard disappointed fans called everything from \\\"fanboys\/girls\\\"\\, crybabies\\, sexist and racist.  Can't we just voice our opinion on this clunker of a movie without being labeled something derogatory?  \\n\\nI just saw this movie and it really stunk.  I've been following reviews for a few days because I had a bad feeling about this movie and the more I heard\\, the less I cared about spoilers.  \\n\\nWhat is interesting to me is that the majority of the reviews I read on this site are not complimentary.  It isn't a large majority\\, but my point is\\, how can RT still be giving it a 51% audience review???  I would imagine it to be MUCH\\, MUCH Lower.  \\n\\nAnd\\, 91% favorablility from critics??  Please.  I wonder how much each were paid for their total bunk reviews.","true":true}
