Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This had all the problems I forgave 'Force Awakens' for in the name of re-setting the franchise (predictability\\, unanswered questions\\, cliches\\, superficial original trilogy callbacks with no developed purpose) PLUS moments of prequel-like slapstick\\, abandonment of the rules of the Force\\, and significant scenes that were clearly meant to mimic the beats of a Marvel movie. This film leaves open the Force Awakens plot holes I expected it to fix\\, and threw in huge ones of its own. There are scenes that are absolutely right and awesome\\, but you get there through cringe-inducing dialogue\\, baffling decisions\\, and lots of deus ex machina.","true":true}
