Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disgrace to Star Wars franchise.  Plot holes\\, weak writing and low quality acting (in some cases) does this movie a disservice given it fantastic visuals.  It is disappointing a movie studio can green light such a script \\, unfortunately i can no longer support as this was truly a chance to make an epic movie.","true":true}
