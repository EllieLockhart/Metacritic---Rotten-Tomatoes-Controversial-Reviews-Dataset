Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall this movie was amazing. I want to see it again. There were parts that I kind of thought were unnecessary or didn't fit with the particular character. Even though I wasn't entirely happy with some of the decisions the decisions made for an entirely terrific movue that I want in my personal collection and fit with the Star Wars legacy.","true":true}
