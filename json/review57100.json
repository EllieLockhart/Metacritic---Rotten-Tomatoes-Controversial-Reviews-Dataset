Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a pointless film. Or perhaps\\, it simply implies the rest of the franchise is and has always been pointless. The Force Awakens invalidated the entire saga up until that point: the Empire\u2019s gone\\, but it\u2019s back... the Rebellion is gone\\, but it\u2019s back... the Republic is back\\, but it\u2019s gone... the Jedi are back\\, but they\u2019re gone... the Sith are gone\\, but they\u2019re back... The Last Jedi carries on this tradition by invalidating the entire plot of The Force Awakens. Who\u2019s Snoke? Who cares! Who\u2019s Rey? Who cares! Want a story about the Skywalker family? Who cares! In short\\, the mysteries posited by The Force Awakens were always going to disappoint some people... I guess I just wasn\u2019t prepared to be disappointed by the answers to every single question I had. At the end of the day\\, the biggest heartbreak of this movie comes in the sense of failed completion at its end. No victory is earned\\, no \u201cpeace and purpose\u201d achieved\\, yet it tells us this is what has arrived. For the first time in my entire life\\, I have no further questions for Star Wars - nor do I care to see where the franchise goes next.","true":true}
