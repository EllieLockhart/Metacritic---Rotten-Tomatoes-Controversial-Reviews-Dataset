Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen this three times now and it gets worse very single time! I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.  Half the things that happen don't make sense.  Rian Johnson is probably the worse writer and director I've ever seen.  I can honestly say that this movie has ruined my view of Star Wars. To me nothing after Return of the Jedi is canon.  The force awakens was acceptable\\, this is not!  Disney doesn't care about fans Disney is using a beloved franchise to do nothing but milk the Star Wars name without any thought to the quality of movie they are putting out.  I hate you Rian Johnson and Disney!","true":true}
