Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The eigth episode of the Star Wars franchise is definitely the one I consider to be the most suspenseful\\, dramatic\\, and nail biting experience in the franchise. Everybody has acted well. The visuals of the worlds in a lot of scenes are beautiful. John Williams' score always fits the mood. It expands the Star Wars lore in a way that not only does it keep you theorizing on what's to come but always has moments that will blow your mind. The story behind this episode is always interesting in a surprising manner. You have to see it for yourself if you haven't. The action is also well done\\, especially with Luke. It shows how much he still has after many years of being gone. I am excited to see what they will do for the next film (which is possibly the last unless they wanna push for ten) and I will say after Carrie Fisher's tragic passing\\, I'm glad that this was the one to end her career on. Star Wars Episode VIII is an 8\/10","true":true}
