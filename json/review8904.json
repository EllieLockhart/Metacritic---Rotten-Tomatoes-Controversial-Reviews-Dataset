Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Found it frustrating that the film decided to ignore the story threads the previous film laid out. In there place we got the slowest car chase ever and a pointless sub plot. But Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamilton and Adam Driver were amazingly good.","true":true}
