Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to rate this movie. It tries so hard to be different that it becomes precisely that: not a good Star Wars film. The plentiful amount of conflicting messages spread throughout the film is favored over good story telling and it scraps whatever payoff was expected from TFA. Do not see this movie if you don't want your characters' story arcs to get butchered.","true":true}
