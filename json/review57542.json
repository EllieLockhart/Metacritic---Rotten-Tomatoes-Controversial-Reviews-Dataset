Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was  good movie......if the other movies did not exist and set a bar. This film was completely underwhelming\\, and the Finn character needs to die immediately! \\n\\nThey have done little to nothing to build secondary villain characters\\, as the originals did with Bobba Fett\\, they have made the main villain weak and he gives you NO threat to the story-line. Where as I like Adam Driver as Kylo\\, I think the character has been poorly written.  He is\\, at the end of the day\\, an emo villain who gets out witted and out maneuvered at every turn. \\n\\nWhat a waste! I loved the originals\\, and liked the prequels\\, giving them credit for originality despite some\\, at times\\, shoddy acting and over use of special effects. \\n\\nThis trilogy is\\, so far\\, an underwhelming mess with a confused and lost story-line\\, often selling out by copying the originals for any sense of  excitement. \\n\\nFinn is garbage\\, Snoke is garbage\\, and so is what Disney is doing to these films. Yay\\, you are banking in on the Star Wars name\\, but shame on you for how you are doing it!","true":true}
