{"101487":169358,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS AHEAD* Before I start I should say I'm a huge Star Wars fan\\, I really am\\, but I have to admit\\, watching this movie\\, I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong\\, it's still a fun ride\\, but I've gotten to the point where a fun ride isn't enough to make a good movie. Let's start with what I liked: The space battles were some of the best I've seen\\, comparable with Rogue One\\, the Canto Bight setting was cool\\, the performances of several actors\\, most notably Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, were very entertaining\\, and the cinematography is amazing. However\\, there's still quite a few negatives: Despite what people are saying\\, I'm still getting a great sense of deja vu with this film to Empire and Jedi (Though not quite to as much of a degree as TFA)\\, including the entire setting of the Resistance fleeing their base and spending the majority of the movie being chased by the First Order\\, the Rey\/Snoke scene being an almost perfect copy paste of the Emperor scene (at least for the majority)\\, and the whole side story to a fancy planet with a seedy underbelly. I seriously thought that the codebreaker was going to be Lando... what even was that guy's name?\\nI had a major problem with Laura Dern's Admiral Holdo. Initially\\, I was okay with her\\, I had been waiting for a corrupt Resistance\/Rebel leader villain character for so long\\, and it was cool to finally get one\\, but the film just decided to pull a 180 on us and reveal she was only pretending to be a bitch. Not only was this a failed attempt at redeeming the character (I still hated her by the time of her death) but it also presents a plot hole by asking: Why the hell didn't she just explain her plan? Oh\\, I know\\, marketing and B plots. On the subject of the Resistance\\, I REALLY wanted to like Rose's character\\, but she really felt like a plot device for Finn's progression\\, and the create an unnecessary love triangle for Episode 9. There's a scene towards the start of the film where a Resistance fighter sacrifices herself to destroy a dreadnaught. When watching this scene I thought: \\\"This is great! We're getting a peek into the life of a Rebel fighter\\, and how their lives can be compromised at any moment!\\\" Too bad this was ultimately turned into a plot device for Rose\\, which ultimately ruins the aforementioned scene.\\nOn the subject of ruined aspects\\, let's talk Snoke. After SO MUCH excitement over who he is\\, the character was killed before he could prove himself to be any more than a poor copy of the Emperor. Admittedly\\, it was interesting that they did this\\, at least it was different I thought\\, but this turned one of the biggest mysteries of the last two years into a plot device for Kylo's character arc. If there hadn't been so much excitement around who this guy was\\, I would've been fine with this\\, but the problem is that it was incredibly unsatisfying and came off as a joke. The same can be said for Rey's parents\\, after so much excitement over their identity\\, what's the answer: \\\"They were just some nobodies.\\\" The two biggest mysteries of the last two years were turned into a joke and a let down. Admittedly\\, they can still fix this in Episode 9\\, but it doesn't change the fact that this movie made the mess to begin with.\\nI won't carry on\\, there's more I wanna say but this isn't really the place. So I'll close with\\, \\\"If you're a fan of Star Wars\\, this movie is still worth seeing\\, but don't expect great quality story telling.\\\" Plot threads and characters were wasted to tie up loose ends quickly\\, even though there's still another movie\\, Rey is still a complete bore of a character (I'm actually more interested in Kylo's story than her's) and there's just too much repetition and unnecessary aspects that either should not have been created in the first place\\, OR introduced in TFA.","true":true}
