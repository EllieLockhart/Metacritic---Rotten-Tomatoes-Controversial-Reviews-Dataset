The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game play is fine\\, voice acting is fine and it looks fine visually. The previous characters\\, Joel and Ellie\\, characters Neil Druckmann said is the heart and soul of the game\\, are pooped all over and sidelined for very awfully written characters that no one wants to play as. Joel and Ellie are very different than before and make bizarre decisions that are out of character. The story is what you get when you pander\\, and hire people like Anita Sarkeesian and have an idiot game director such as Druckmann.\rIf this wasn't a sequel and you didn't know as much Joel and Ellie\\, i could see it being rated a little higher than it is.\rI would give it a 4 max for having fair game play and visuals. But i have to subtract from there. Neil Druckmann\\, after **** on everything to pander\\, decided to put himself in the game\\, twice like a douchy narcissist.  One is in the form of an extremely cringy collectible card titled Dr. Uckmann. The card talks about how he was ostracized from the 'scientific community' for pushing human limits. The other is literally a sex scene that was apparently mo capped by him.  So that brings my score down to a 2.\rAnything that involves Anita Sarkeesian is going to be a point lost and what they decided to do to the characters\\, ill combine that.\rSo that brings it down to a 1.\rExcept all of the 10\/10 ratings that people know are paid off that are running rampant is going to bring it down to a solid zero. Seriously watch any gaming stream and judge peoples reaction when they play the game. It's garbage and any fan of the original last of us knows this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
