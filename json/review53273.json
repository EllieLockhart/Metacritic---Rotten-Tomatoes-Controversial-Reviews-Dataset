Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematography-5 stars\\nCGI-4.5 stars\\nStoryline-1 star\\nCharacter depth or backstory-0 stars\\nCharacter development-0 stars\\nPacing of the movie-0 stars\\n\\nRian Johnson had claimed to be a huge fan\\, but I'm left wondering if he had ever actually seen a Star Wars movie. Before this Rian had only directed 7 movies\\, and I'd only heard of one of them. His inexperience in movie making really shines through in this epic failure. In the previous movie JJ Abrams did a great job of setting up his \\\"mystery boxes\\\" that left us wanting\\, so all Rian had to do was answer those and add in a couple more. Instead\\, the movie became a comedy that fell flat at every turn and was often met with silence from the audience. All the old characters were disrespected\\, all the new characters became bumbling idiots who couldn't do anything right\\, and of course the only competent character\\, Mary Sue\\, continued to be as we expected.","true":true}
