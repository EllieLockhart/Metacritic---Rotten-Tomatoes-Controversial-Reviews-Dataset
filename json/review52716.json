Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the Star Wars cliche and Easter eggs that fans are hoping for. Enough of its own plot to stand alone for the non-fans that get drug along. Cute new characters like the porgs and a high-roller casino scene and a new whimsical layer to the Star Wars universe. A female Jedi and several important multi-racial characters makes the film feel more relatable to a wider audience the the historic nerdy white fanboy base that\u2019s the critical base of the franchise.","true":true}
