Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am big fan of Star Wars. Love this universe. And this film was awsome. Story\\, characters\\, actions all this at the highest level. Looked at one go. My favorite film! So cool! A lot of their ideas and innovations\\, courageous moves. The original trilogy is felt\\, but the Last Jedi surprises with its plot turns and what is happening. It was unexpected and interesting.","true":true}
