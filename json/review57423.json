Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a serious disappointment. The musical score and performance by Mark Hamill were truly it's only redeeming qualities. I am not even sure Rian Johnson watched The Force Awakens. He threw everything out and answered no questions about anything people cared about. I am not even sure where they take the next movie and not even sure I will care. There was no character development. Snoke was a perfect example of a character fans were dying to know about. How was he involved with Darth Vader etc? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Rose got more screen time than most of the characters I would love to have seen developed. The whole Leia flying through space looking like Mary Poppins was totally insane. The whole premise of first order and resistance ships flying at the same speed and being out of range to be destroyed was also utterly ridiculous. Rose showing up on the Millennium Falcon after being on the battlefield was stupid. I am not sure which movie the film critics watched\\, but a true fan of Star Wars cannot be thrilled with the direction this movie took the franchise.This movie franchise is in major trouble and will need to be reinvented to earn my respect and money. It's honestly my least favorite Star Wars movie out of the nine that have been made.","true":true}
