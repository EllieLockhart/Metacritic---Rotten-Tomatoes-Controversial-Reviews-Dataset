Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've waited a bit to write this\\, well... a lot more than a bit\\, a year and a half. I have come around on this movie. Upon further thought\\, it is a good star wars movie. If you dislike it\\, I recommend you watch it again\\, and really analyze what you're watching.","true":true}
