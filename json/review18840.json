Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an awesome film and I highly recommend you go. Awesome character development\\, great special effects\\, and a plot that leaves you guessing until the end of the film. The only reason it loses a hall Star is because of how the movie treats Luke's character. I felt like some of the choices were wrong for him\\, but great job by Mark Hammil as always. You definitely need to go!!","true":true}
