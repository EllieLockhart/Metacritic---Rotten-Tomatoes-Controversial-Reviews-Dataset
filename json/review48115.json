Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie wasn't without fault\\, including the seemingly unnecessary casino plot and an unfortunate waste of potential for the development of Finn\\, this is easily one of the most beautiful movies in the Saga\\, is built around an incredibly strong theme (failure being the greatest teacher)\\, and features the best dynamic between light and dark characters in any of the Star Wars movies.","true":true}
