Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adds to the list of recent Star Wars movies that have finally put some effort into blurring the line between good and evil. Hopefully\\, the franchise will eventually realize less is more\\, and tones down the CGI. Had the right number of weird goofy references to previous movies\\, with plenty of new canon.","true":true}
