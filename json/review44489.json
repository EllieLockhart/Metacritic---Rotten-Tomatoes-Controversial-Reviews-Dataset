Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To paraphrase Hans Solo: \\\"That's not how how Star Wars movies work.\\\"\\n\\nSo many WTF moments in TLJ that is seems like a parody more than canon. \\n\\n> Spoilers < \\n.\\n.\\n.\\nLuke tossing his light saber over his shoulder\\nPrincess Leia force flying through space\\nSnoke's 1960's disco studio\\nHorse-like creatures running wild through a cassino\\nAll powerful Snoke's trivial death\\nThe downer of an ending\\nuggh.","true":true}
