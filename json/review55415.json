Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many people defending this movie rationalize it by believing that people who don't like this movie are just unhappy with the direction that Rian Johnson took the story. That isn't necessarily true.To be clear\\, some of us are open to killing off Snoke\/giving Leia force powers\/making Luke anti-Jedi. What we do care about is poor storytelling to set up HUGE changes like these\\, and plot holes\\, contradictions\\, and compensating for a lack of character development by trying to throw in \\\"twists.\\\" Case in point: Killing off Snoke was pointless because his character wasn't developed in the first place\\, and even if he was developed\\, it's not believable that Kylo is powerful enough based on the script writing(he got beat by Rey\\, who had no training). Issues like this appear everywhere (i.e. how is Rey able to be that strong with the force in literally minutes\\, Snoke is portrayed as one of the most powerful force users we have seen in the movies but can't see the lightsaber turning\\, Leia uses powerful force powers but never uses them the rest of the movie\\, Luke hating the Jedi is not believable based on the storytelling and what actually happened\\, Luke isn't interested in redeeming Kylo from the dark side and that is literally his thing (and its pretty much his fault\\, so he should be even more committed)\\, setting up Kylo as powerful and intimidating for the next movie by beating Snoke isn't believable because Kylo has childish tantrums\\, doesn't appear that committed to power\\, the dark side\\, or even ruling the galaxy\\, and\\, once again\\, got beat by Rey.) I guess making Star Wars \\\"new and different\\\" is synonymous with poor directing and story-writing.","true":true}
