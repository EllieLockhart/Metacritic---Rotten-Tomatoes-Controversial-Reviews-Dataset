Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was terrible. It made me feel physical pain. \\nthe characters are just jokes\\, caricatures of themselves. \\nthere's no epic at all. \\neverything is narrated quickly and without feelings. \\nall the good things from episode VII are like non existent. one of the biggest questions from VII about Rei parents is resolved like it was nothing and it looks like they had no idea of how to do it. the movie leaves you without any curiosity to see a sequel\\, which I'm pretty sure IS NOT what a franchise should do.\\nthe direction? Rian Johnson was able to do wrong almost everything\\, especially in filming the dialogues (they're like a lousy series from the 80s).\\nthe writing? well\\, there was an idea in it\\, but it was developed poorly and without professionalism.\\nthe comedy scenes are just there to entertain the audience and to distract them during that 2 and half hours\\, but they don't have an actual use. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at the start of the movie. by the end I was praying for it to finish.\\nthis cannot be saved.","true":true}
