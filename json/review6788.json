Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't read if you don't want spoilers. Disney destroyed the franchise with this movie. Destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker. He would never try to kill his nephew in his sleep. They Killed Snope without ever telling his back story. I think they want a fresh start with their new actors and new stupid fuzzy creatures that they can sell in the Disney stores. I will never watch another movie in this series. It's done. It's a hot mess of special effects with no story\\, and no character development.  And the beginning with the Poe and the fake phone call? Seriously?  We're not 8 years old! All of the campy jokes were way out of place without Han Solo telling them.","true":true}
