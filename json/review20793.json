Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie but was again underwhelmed with this Rey trilogy. Overall\\, it was a \u201cgood\u201d and much better than TFA; however was not even close to Rogue One IMO. This Disney trilogy has felt patched movie to movie and seems to be lacking a broad vision. On a positive note\\, TLJ did a much better job with Rey\u2019s character this time and gave her much more depth - even Kylo seemed a better fit this time. However\\, much of the story was borderline boring and the ending just felt lazy and very unsatisfying as a long time Star Wars fan. ","true":true}
