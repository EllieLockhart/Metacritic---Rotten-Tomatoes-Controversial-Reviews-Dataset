Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films. Subverts your expectations at every turn\\, takes risks\\, great hand over from the old heroes to the new. Smart film\\, impeccable visuals\\, breathtaking action\\, quality drama and adventure.","true":true}
