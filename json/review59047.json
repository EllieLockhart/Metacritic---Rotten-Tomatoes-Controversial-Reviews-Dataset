We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I just finished the game and I actually really love it. It was amazing\\, sad\\, brilliant\\, savage\\, heartbreaking\\, like should be an apocalypse story. I'm not even mad for Joel death\\, I really loved this character and his death was maybe brutal\\, but I will remember this character forever\\, how much he was important for Ellie as a father-like figure\\, but he wasn't a perfect human being\\, he made mistake too and the end of his life came\\, paying for his actions. He's still unforgettable. I can understand why you can get mad and sad about it\\, but no need to cry like a baby just for it (or anything else in the story or in the characters\\, come on\\, grow up). It's a apocalypse game\\, what you excepted ? A fairytale story where everything and everyone are kind and gentle and perfect? People die\\, people get revenge\\, it's normal. LTOU II is a great game about the apocalypse and everything what's involve\\, even if it's shocking. The characters developements was correct and credible\\, playing Abby was suprising and interesting to see her point of views and what she's did was totally understable (I personnaly think)\\, her character came with some interestings choices. The end is maybe not 'a perfect ending story'\\, but it's impacting\\, killing Abby won't bring back Joel\\, I think Ellie made a good decision\\, even after all she came trought\\, she realise something. Now she need to find peace in her mind and move on. The first game was about family love trought the end of world\\, now it's about something crual\\, revenge\\, anger\\, and it's perfectly coherent and realistic. Anyway\\, Neil Druckmann and his team still made an incredible game\\, you can disagree about some things that you don't like\\, it's correct\\, but no need to be an **** like some people here. The story\\, voice acting\\, musics\\, ambiance and gameplay was incredible and I will remember this game for long time. Congrats.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
