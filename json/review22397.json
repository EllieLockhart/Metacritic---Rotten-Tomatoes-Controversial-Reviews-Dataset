Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Least favorite of all the Star Wars movies.....The good ...Last 40 minutes was epic!....Great Action and a few surprises! The Bad: The story as a whole was badly organized.  New characters were not memorable or original.  The Frustrating: They took the easy way out and gave us no back story on the two biggest mysteries from the first movie....who is Supreme Leader Snoke? Who is Rey's parents? I can not believe they are giving Rian Johnson his own Trilogy.  Wow after the negative User reviews that is a grave mistake! It will be the first Star Wars movie that I won't go to the Theater to watch....Very disappointed!","true":true}
