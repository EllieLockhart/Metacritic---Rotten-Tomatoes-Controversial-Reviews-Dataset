Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know what personality type hates this movie but it\u2019s strange to me that ratings are so profoundly split between great and horrible \u2013 not many in-between. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The frantic survival of the rebellion\\, unpredictable plot twists\\, and incredible effects\\, and cinematography\\, and humor make this an excellent movie and on par with Empire Strikes Back. The producers didn\u2019t force Star Wars nostalgia and developed this story well. Someone wrote\\, \u201calmost every plot-line was a pointless misdirection\u201d. Yep\\, and that\u2019s one of the things that made the movie great!","true":true}
