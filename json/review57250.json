Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had the potential to be one of the best movies in the series. Episode 7 had so much unanswered questions and interesting characters with (potential) mysterious back stories that could have been reveiled in episode 8 with an interesting story. i.e.:\\n\\nSnoke's history\\, Luke training Rey\\, Phasma's character development\\, Rey's prarents reveal\\, Fin and Po's integration and impact on the plot\/storey...\\n\\nThey could have used all of the above to formulate a epic movie\\, but instead decided to discard the above factors and rather do a Pirates of the Caribbean type movies where I felt exhausted half way into the movie due to horrible pacing\\, stupid plot holes and dumb character decisions.\\n\\nI love the origional trilogy and even defend the prequal trilogy because I think they are nder rated\\, but this movie...sigh...this is the first time I felt empty after watching Star Wars movie\\, where I walked out of the cinema feeling empty thinking: I dont care what happens next in SW\\, in fact\\, I think It is best that it rather just ended happily in Endor","true":true}
