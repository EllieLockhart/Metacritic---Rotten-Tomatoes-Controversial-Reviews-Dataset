Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. This is a movie of great moments\\, but overall busy with nonsense. I was constantly entertained but hate the direction. SPOILER ALERT! How can this movie end so optimistic when the rebels are now down to 30 people on board the Falcon??? So many lives have been lost including Skywalker\\, why is everyone smiling and hugging during the finale? The tone of this movie was totally wrong\\, I don't blame Johnson\\, he's dealing with a super studio.","true":true}
