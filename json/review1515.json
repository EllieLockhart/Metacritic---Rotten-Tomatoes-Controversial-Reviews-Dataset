Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Jewish person. I feel violated from watching this movie.\\n\\nI asked for my money back from the movie theater manager. YES\\, it was that bad. \\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBECAUSE there was not NEARLY enough RACE-MIXING. Every girl should have been fawning over Fin's huge nose that goes from cheek to cheek\\, not to mention his galaxy-sized watermelon mouth. Everyone knows that blacks was kings. Remember Eygpt\\, BIGOT?! WOMEN LOVE THE BBC\\, WHITE BOYS GET OVER IT. WHITE WOMEN LOVE THE PUNGENT SMELL OF AFRICA. \\n\\nFurthermore\\, there was not NEARLY enough FEMALE EMPOWERMENT. They should have had a scene of some filthy white males being castrated for being white and male.\\n\\n0\/10 This movie was Nazi propaganda.","true":true}
