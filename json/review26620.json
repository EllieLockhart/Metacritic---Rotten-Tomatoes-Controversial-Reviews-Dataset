Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay...  Luke is Old\\, and no Death Star!  If I had said this right away\\, I could have saved half the viewers ten bucks.  To the remaining 50%\\, Trust me\\, this movie lived up to the Star Wars hype.  I would suspect the die-hard fans are bringing the reviews down because they want more of the exact same thing.  This movie is a satisfying part two to the NEW trilogy.  Just don't expect a full 70 year old cast lead this adventure.","true":true}
