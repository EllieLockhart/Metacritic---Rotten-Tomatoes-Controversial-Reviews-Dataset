Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fake Reviews!\\nAre TlJ reviews at the bleeding edge of the new cultural war? Probably not\\, but on leaving the cinema I was lost to understand the delta between my own opinions and that of the film press. This was not an enjoyable film. The first 2hrs reminded me of the steam roller gag in Austin Powers. The last 30 mins were somewhat redeeming. However\\, the knowing wink Luke tips to CP3O is a metaphor for the spirit of the film. \\nI found the film boring. I didn't like the dialogue. And worst of all I was forced to be complicit in the slow debasement of some of Cinema's most loved characters\\, which left me with the difficult conundrum of whether I could walk out of the new Star Wars film\\, or not.\\nLeia spacewalk was the worst. Why not Solo her? It wouldn't have been great\\, but better than what follows. I did enjoy some of the CGI back ground characters though\\nI think that if I was a 12-year-old I may have got some more enjoyment out of this film\\, but that's ignoring the run-time. The critics score will remain\\, but the audience score for this film will show the real film that we all had to endure. \\nI'm happy for anyone who is able to take pleasure from a film\\, but my original point stands\\, what did the critics see in this film that they liked so much?","true":true}
