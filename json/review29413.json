Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson does a great job with this latest chapter in the story.  While some in our group found it to be a bit dialogue heavy\\, I did not.  I found it to be a very entertaining\\, somewhat surprising\\, twist in the saga.  It had complexities\\, humor\\, and action that made it thought provoking\\, interesting\\, and fun.  I can't wait to see this movie again!","true":true}
