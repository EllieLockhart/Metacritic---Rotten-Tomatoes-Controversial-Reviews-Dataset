Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Different\\, good but different. Director Rian Johnson takes the Star Wars Saga in a direction we weren't quite expecting. Adding to the mythos of the Force and of course Star Wars. It's funny\\, as while this is NOT as similar to Empire as The Force Awakens was to a New Hope. It is getting the same reaction as Empire. Splitting options. \\n\\nTo go from TFA to this\\, wow. One film was a safe return to the Galaxy of far\\, far away. While this takes risks in going in a new direction. Theories have been disproven. As Skywalker said in the trailer: \\\"This isn't going to go\\, the way you think\\\". \\n\\nA well made film\\, with great performances especially from Mark\\, Daisy\\, Adam and the late Carrie Fisher. With some beautiful imagery. \\n\\nGiven it's similar reaction (like Empire) in time this film will be seen as one of the best from the Saga.","true":true}
