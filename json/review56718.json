{"101487":176528,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-09-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had stunning visuals: That's the star and a half that I feel it properly deserves. In terms of storytelling\\, it falls completely flat\\, as if it was written by someone without an appreciation of the series as a whole. The way they handled the main characters (Luke and Leia) felt straight up weird\\, disrespectful (Luke milking some alien cow?)\\, and out of touch\\, and the relationships\/stories of the side characters (Finn\\, Kylo\\, Rey) weren't developed enough to be intriguing or convey the depth the story deserved. \\n\\nThe casino scene and rationale for it were unfounded. The purple haired lady seemed completely out of place. Using light speed to destroy the ships was clever\\, but it cancels any future battles in space (or \\\"star wars\\,\\\" if you will)... after she did that in the SW universe\\, there is no longer any reason to not put an android on a Tie Fighter or X-wing and cause mass destruction via kamikaze attacks. Snoke turned out to be a chump and super easy to kill. Rose almost killing Finn to stop him from saving the rebellion (made no sense at all). Prank calls with \\\"Your mama\\\" jokes exist in a galaxy far\\, far away. The list goes on and on.\\n\\nI genuinely enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, Rogue One\\, and the Solo movie... But The Last Jedi is just a mess. 1.5\/5","true":true}
