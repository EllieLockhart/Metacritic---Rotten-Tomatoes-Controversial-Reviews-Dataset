Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes everywhere \\nUnfunny comedy\\nNo character development\\nSubliminal political agendas \\nBoring as hell\\nSpits on the OT\\nNo clear direction as to where it is headed or what this trilogy is about\\nMore politics\\nPlain vanilla female characters who have no personality charisma or character developments","true":true}
