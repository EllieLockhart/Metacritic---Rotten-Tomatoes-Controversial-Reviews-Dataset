Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi has ruined Star Wars for me as a whole. Although the cgi and imagery used in this movie are amazing\\, the plot is an incoherent mess with shallow and inconsistent characters. Luke Skywalker who has been established as a hero in the Star Wars universe was treated as a joke in this movie and all the character development he had undergone in the og trilogy was pointless. The Finn and rose subplot was pointless and seemed like filler. Rey is already so strong with the force without having any training and even bested Luke Skywalker in a duel. And then there's Kylo Ren who is so inconsistent throughout the movie with his mood changing every scene and with Snoke dead\\, kylo is supposed to be the main villain in this trilogy which is a joke as he is still the Same whiny brat from the last movie who throws tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants. This movie has officially ruined Star Wars for me and I do Not see how Disney can fix this unless they remove this episode from Canon. Ryan Johnson has probably never watched the force awakens before as this movie seems so disjointed from its predecessor. I discourage all other Star Wars fans from watching this movie to show Disney that they can't get away with the horseshit that is the last jedi.","true":true}
