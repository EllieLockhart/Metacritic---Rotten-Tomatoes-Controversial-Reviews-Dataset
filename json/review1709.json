{"101487":105361,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a preface\\, I loved the original Star Wars trilogy\\, enjoyed the prequel trilogy\\, and appreciated The Force Awakens (despite Rey no-training force powers).  But The Last Jedi is a total farce; there is no authenticity to the characters\\, a total disregard of the framework built with TFA\\, and disparagement of the episodes that came before.  Clearly the director had no connection or appreciation for the prior Star Wars installments.  Also\\, the humor was cheesy and did not work in the context of the movie.  Additionally the Social Justice Warrior \/ feminist agenda was over the top in this movie and distracting from real story-telling (and this I say as a liberal democrat).  If Mark Hamill had creative oversight of the project the movie would have been 10x better or at least a real \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie.","true":true}
