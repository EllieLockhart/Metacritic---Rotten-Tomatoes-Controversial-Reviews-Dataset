Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I'm not happy with Disney's execution\\, the movie as a whole I found enjoyable. Plus\\, I loved the surprise ending. One thing that's overlooked\\, is that for the first time ever in the SW franchise\\, I have no idea what will happen in Episode IX. I've watched so many films that it's rare if Hollywood ever surprises me. Even if I don't like the film\\, I will always give credit for writers and directors breaking the mold and not following the same tropes. This movie definitely surprised me. I do want a better execution of ideas from SW movies so I hope they up the quality next time.","true":true}
