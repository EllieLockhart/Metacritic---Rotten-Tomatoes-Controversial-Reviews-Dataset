Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disgrace to all things star wars! It was really sad to see how they handled the character of luke\\, which is definitely one of most favorite characters of many fans! some simply came just to see him in action. But it was a big let down...\\n\\nAs a movie it was a good movie \\, but as a star wars movie it was horrible!! All the prequel movies seems to be like gold compared to this. :\/ have lost all hope for episode IX","true":true}
