Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to write a response to a lot of the hateful comments about this movie. Besides the angry spoilers so they can ruin it for others they are truly ignorant of their own bias. The original trilogy is not amazing writing and character development. It\u2019s a simple story told in a fantastic way. We love SW because of the clear lines of good and bad and family issues that create conflict. A lot of people created a story in there own head and would love to direct their own SW movie. If they did achieve this goal they would have more haters then JJ. This movie was beautiful and well done. Go see it and decide for yourself and remember to put bias aside.","true":true}
