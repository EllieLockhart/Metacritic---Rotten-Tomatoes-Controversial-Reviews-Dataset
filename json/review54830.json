Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was an excellent movie. It was very creative and full of surprises. The Star Wars universe was rendered much less Black and White\/Good and Evil\\, which created space for far more nuanced characters and motivations which is more interesting. I had been curious about Snoke's backstory and just what WAS he\\, so his abrupt delish was a touch annoying to me. Other than that\\, the film delighted me.\\n\\n\\nThe little cute bird creatures were unnecessary but if you must have something with little kid appeal\\, it beats having Ewoks using sticks to take down storm troopers.\\n\\n5 stars.","true":true}
