Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible... why perfect something and subvert expectations when the originals 3 are better than every way. Like I really tried but if me... a guy who thought terminator 3 was good you know you fucked up.","true":true}
