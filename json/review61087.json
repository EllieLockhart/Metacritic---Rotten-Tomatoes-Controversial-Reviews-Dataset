Combat is okay nothing that innovative but there are people who will be okay and might have fun with that the new enemies feel like a gimmick and less organic than i thought but they\u2019re serviceable. I dont know why jumping is a thing it didnt have to be in there and no one would\u2019ve batted an eye. The atmosphere is honestly inconsistent in execution\\, things just seem to happen and you\u2019re along for the subpar ride. Subpar ride because the writing is not good sometimes i would daresay rushed and unpolished to the point it broke immersion multiple times when characters do things that history shows they wouldn\u2019t do thats a case of poor execution on a part of the developers. And the slow sections just seem to drag this game\\, length could\u2019ve been chopped up and it wouldnt have ruined anything. The new and i say that loosely characters honestly dont really stand out and even with motives for some they are hard to empathize with or relate to and very much unlikeable. It is possible to relate but the writing is not strong enough to do it. Also DMCA-ing channels for having a different opinion or exercising their right as a fan to speak out is distasteful and doesnt help your purpose. Take some responsibility for you actions. This game gets a 4 from me because take away the story the gameplay is an 8 (the story is a 2). 8 divided by 2 is 4 it\u2019s mediocre. Can it still be a success yes but lets not pretend there are already games coming up that will be better than this and less insulting\/divisive how did this get such high ratings really gaming journalists have some standards and hold these studios accountable when they do slimey things. Shock value for the sake of shock value is lame and lazy\\, Game of Thrones tried it everyone loved it until they started killing off characters those same people who liked it cared about\\,plus the writing was inconsistent and all over as well lets be real. Funny enough though....The difference being what Daenerys did if you really think about it (take the angry sunglasses off) given the history and context (despite bad writing laced throughout the entire show) makes more sense than what Ellie does in the end\\, thats sad. I know what you were trying to get at but c\u2019mon we expect better from you Naughty Dog. Also please treat your workers better too many articles are out there saying you don\u2019t.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
