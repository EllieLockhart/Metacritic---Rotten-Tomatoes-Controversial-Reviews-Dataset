Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty good not great. Excellent visuals\\, good story that plodded at times though\\, and hit and miss humour. And amazingingly awkward but awesome Luke drinking some boob milk scene.\\n\\nSad to see this movie getting trashed by guys who need to get out their parent's basements and others who are crying because they had a preconceived notion of what this movie would be. Waaahhhh go cry a river.","true":true}
