Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie caused me physical pain. It is terrible from start to end and I sincerely hope that the negative reviews stop people from viewing this disaster. Putting the Star Wars issues beside that many complain about - TLJ is simply not a good movie.\\nUpdate: Seems\\, as 1\/2 star reviews do not count\\, therfore I give 1 star. The movie is worth less than zero stars...","true":true}
