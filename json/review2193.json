Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible plot with undeveloped characters cannot replace the legends of the original trilogy that are disgraced in this film.  Bring back George Lucas and remake this garbage!","true":true}
