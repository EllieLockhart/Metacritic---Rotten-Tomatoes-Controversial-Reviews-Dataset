Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Several months later\\, and I'm still disturbed and upset at how Rian Johnson ran the Skywalker saga completely off the rails. I felt betrayed by this film\\, and its flippant treatment of all the characters. \\n\\nAdding insult to injury are the new onslaught of fake 5-star reviews. Take a look... they are usually about one sentence long\\, and sometimes just a phrase. Truly sad that Disney will stoop so low just to bump up a film so universally panned by the fans.","true":true}
