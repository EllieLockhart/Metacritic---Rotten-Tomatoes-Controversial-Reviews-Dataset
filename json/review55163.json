Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie not knowing of the director change from The Force Awakens to The Last Jedi\\, but it took probably 30 minutes until I realized something was way off. I am not a huge Star Wars \\\"nerd\\\" so it would be pretty easy to entertain me without let down\\, much like TFA did. However\\, this movie had me leaving the theaters very confused. What the F did I just watch was the main feeling. When I realized it wasn't JJ Abrams directing\/writing\\, I started investigating. Rian Johnson was apparently beat up by Jedi as a kid\\, and this is his payback. Rian's attempt to create something NEW and different ended up with a mess of a movie. You can read all the other reviews\\, they are not lying. ROSE sucks as a character\\, and isn't so much as annoying as she is completely pointless. Finn sucks in this movie too\\, and him and REY are not together at all. No point to their friendship\/chemistry from TFA. He has a new GF now\\, ROSE! Downgrade for sure. I had thought Rose was a lesbian whose lover died in the beginning. It was her sister I guess\\, but who cares. Her sister had a more important role in the movie than her and she blew herself up in the first 5 minutes. I could go into almost every scene and critique it for being either stupid\\, plot hole\\, or it going against everything we saw in the original 3 or the last movie (Snoke\\, Plasma\\, Rey are all pointless I guess and Luke and Leia are both killing kids\/space flying respectively)\\, but I don't want this movie to waste anymore of my time.\\n\\n1 star because I read RT doesn't count 1\/2 stars. They are too busy buying off the \\\"real\\\" critics it seems.","true":true}
