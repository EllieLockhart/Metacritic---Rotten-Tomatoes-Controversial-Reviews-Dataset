Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a genuinely good movie that has received far too much hate.  It is brilliantly shot\\, and it is not afraid to take chances\\, especially with beloved characters.  These bold moves have caused much controversy\\, but they are why I find this movie to be so refreshing: It is not afraid to do what other Star Wars movies have been afraid to do.  Kylo Ren is also a very intriguing villain\\, and Rey is very easy to root for. I would definitely recommend that everyone watch this movie.","true":true}
