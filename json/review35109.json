Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force awakens came to us 2 years ago\\, giving us a fresh new view on the Star Wars universe\\, The Last Jedi  does very well telling this new take on the univeres amazingly. It may have some flaws all movies do\\, but this movie\\, made me sad\\, happy\\, excited\\, put me at the edge of my seat\\, made me laugh\\, it was a great ride. It was a good way to continue the skywalker legacy. I give this a 5\/5 because I have no isuse with it.","true":true}
