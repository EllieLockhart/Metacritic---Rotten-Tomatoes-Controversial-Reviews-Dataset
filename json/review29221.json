Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Repeating things that have already been repeated. The rebels-up-against-it plot\\, with heroes worn down to the nub of their fighting spirit\\, feels like a rehash of Rogue One\\, and the attempts to echo the look and mood and darkening design of The Empire Strikes Back makes clear that the new trilogy is an official monument to nostalgia.","true":true}
