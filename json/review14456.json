Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I happen to love this movie\\, as does my husband\\, who is a long-term Star Wars fan.  Yes\\, there were a few plot holes\\, and the b-plot with Finn and Rose seems a bit contrived\\, but there is a bit a world-building involved that isn't immediately apparent.  The old guard of the resistance is dying off- Han is gone\\, now Luke\\, and with the death of Carrie Fischer\\, chances are Leia will die offscreen in between movies.  This is far from the last movie\\, and events will unfold that many of the naysayers will never see coming.","true":true}
