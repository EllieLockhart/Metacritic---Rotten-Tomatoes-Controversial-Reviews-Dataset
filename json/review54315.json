{"101487":133541,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-14","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate the fact that I get to be \\\"that guy\\,\\\" but The Last Jedi is...fine. It's got a lot more action that previous installments and a much-needed dose of self-aware humor. However (and I won't spoil anything) for a franchise that's built itself on major twists and revelations\\, The Last Jedi plays things surprisingly straight; almost every fan theory that's been floating around the internet for the past year is significantly better than the revelations that are actually in the movie. There's also an hour-long subplot regarding a casino planet that feels vastly out of place and goes absolutely nowhere. Still\\, people will love it because of what it is and the nostalgia\\, with a sequence that feels like it tries WAYY too hard to capitalize on that nostalgia (you'll know it when you see it). But at the end of the day\\, it does its job\\, and that's to provide a couple hours of solid entertainment. Just don't expect much more.","true":true}
