Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They turned star wars into a comedy movies and take away many scenes that could bring emotion and love to the fans who enjoy and love the series. Instead it is riddled with comedy and lighthearted conversation. There are some moments that do bring Star Wars to life\\, but those are few and far in between here.","true":true}
