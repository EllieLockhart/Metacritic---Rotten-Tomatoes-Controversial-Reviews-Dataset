Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I start. I was pleased with the Force Awakens and the possibilities of this brave new world. Unfortunately\\, Disney and Rian Johnson missed what is the true heart and sole of Star Wars. It was the hope of our hero's.  I have trouble accepting the despondent version of Luke and Leia\\, they are not who they were or should be. Disney and Johnson have sent a signal that all they want to do is discard and throw away the old and move on to create something totally different in the name of Star Wars only.","true":true}
