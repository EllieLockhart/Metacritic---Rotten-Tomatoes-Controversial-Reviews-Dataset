Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan my entire life. Love them all. But this is not a good movie. Totally blew any chance of being a great movie. It was a real disappointment. You have to see it for yourself\\, but so much of this was pointless and didn't accomplish anything. SPOILER: \\nTo make a person that couldn't defeat an untrained Jedi into Supreme Leader is beyond the pale. Ridiculous at best.","true":true}
