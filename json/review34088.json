Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly written\\, holes larger than the Grand Canyon in the plot and the writer\/director had no respect for the tremendous amount of cannon lore that is the Star Wars universe. Bizarre choice\\, very little action (although what was done was overly done well that they're interesting to watch but there were tons of issues with those as well)\\, and\\, having said all of this\\, the acting was great but totally ruined by the frankly lazy writing. If you don't care about Star Wars or story\\, you might actually enjoy the movie. If you care about story or using the same Star Wars universe the other 8 movies\\, the clone wars\\, who knows how many books and the video games all exist in\\, you likely won't. Super disappointed but he'll get another film because it is making money. Episode 9 will be my last Star Wars film ever. Please do not make it a very close to remake of Return of the Jedi like the first two have been.","true":true}
