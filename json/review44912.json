Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two stars for visuals and score. Everything else is a complete mess. Only Star Wars movie I ever saw that I have no desire to see again. The Phantom Menace at least had Darth Maul and one of the greatest saber duals in Star Wars. The Attack of the Clones at least had Ewan McGregor. The Force Awakens at least was funny and had an emotional death scene. THIS movie has nothing. None of that. It is pretty to look at and listen to\\, Mark Hamill tries his best\\, and Daisy is pretty. That is all that is good about this movie. There were so many idiotic scenes that I thought I was watching Jurassic World again. Welcome to the modern blockbuster where everything is about checking a box and trying to be funny\\, even if failing to succeed at that. Forget the past. Kill it if you have to. Congrats\\, Disney. You've killed it.","true":true}
