Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved everything about The Last Jedi. The performances were amazing.  This put character development above spectacle but the action sequences were still incredible.  Rian Johnson really did something new with this movie and too Star Wars to a new level.  I can't wait to go see it again and can't recommend it highly enough.","true":true}
