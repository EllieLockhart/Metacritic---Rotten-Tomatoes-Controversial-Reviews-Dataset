Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie looking forward to seeing the development of the characters and stories that Edpisode 7 introduced us to. Unfortunately we saw a number of what was suggested\\, brushed aside and made irrelevant. Forgettable new characters pushed into the story that I probably wouldn't miss if they didn't appear in Episdoe 9. Iconic original characters contradicting their own narrative from previous episodes. Plot scenes that failed to make an impact.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi  downplays the saga's rich legacy while adding some disappointing twists -- and failing to deliver answers from questions asked in TFA which fans hoped for.","true":true}
