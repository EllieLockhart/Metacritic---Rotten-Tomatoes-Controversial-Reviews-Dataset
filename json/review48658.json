Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst film of the franchise. The first half left me bored to almost tears. Multiple scenes that just wasted time. and felt like forced comedy. Multiple characters ruined\\, wasted\\, or just not needed. I will never see another star wars film in theaters","true":true}
