Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had good special\/sound effects but that's about it just didn't really feel like a Star Wars movie to me anymore. If you want to know the reasons why I'd highly suggest you watch the review from E;R about the last jedi since my points pretty much are the same like his (aka the plot holes Ray being a mary sue)","true":true}
