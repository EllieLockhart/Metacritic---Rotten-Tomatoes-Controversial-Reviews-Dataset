Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw a YouTube video about people leaving good reviews for The Last Jedi so I went ahead and created on myself. Why would someone care about someone liking a movie? Why would someone care about other people like a hit movie that most people like? Very strange. The Last Jedi is great!","true":true}
