Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film's sole purpose isn't to push things forward or to build upon anything. It is reckless subversion for the sake of subversion. It is deconstruction with no meaning or purpose. It is a cynically assembled soapbox\\, made by people so arrogant and unappreciative that they would stand atop the legacy of one of film's most quintessential tales just to make an uninsightful\\, short-sighted point about \\\"leaving the past behind\\\"\\, and toss some hamfisted political notes at the captive audience. It is worse than any corporate cash-in or any moronic prequels. The Last Jedi is an articulate attack on Star Wars itself and everything it represents. These people had no idea what they were dealing with. The Last Jedi was a cinematic manslaughter.","true":true}
