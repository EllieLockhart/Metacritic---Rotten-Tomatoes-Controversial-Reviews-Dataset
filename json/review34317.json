Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was horrible.  The scenes were edited together by amateurs.They failed to do more with Luke's character.  The only plus side was that there were lots of explosions.  The critics reviewing this garbage must be blind.","true":true}
