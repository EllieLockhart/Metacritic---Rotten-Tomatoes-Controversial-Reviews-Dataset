Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I tried to like this film\\,.. I really tried. The comedy was horrible\\, the story had more plot holes than a piece of Swiss cheese\\, and 70% of the questions in the las movie were either left unanswered or completely disregarded. I feel so bad for Mark Hamill especially. Watching him in this role was like watching a loved one in hospice slowly go downhill and die. As a movie this is bad. As a Star Wars movie this is horrendous. Even now I tried to be lenient to this merchandise driven pile of galactic trash. Thanks for hearing my honest Star Wars loving opinion.","true":true}
