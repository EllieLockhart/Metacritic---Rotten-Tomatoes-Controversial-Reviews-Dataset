Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly an okay movie\\, but an absolutely HORRIBLE Star Wars film. Most of those praising the film are saying they weren't previously Star Wars fans\\, or really into Star Wars\\, which is exactly the problem. The movie was not made to appeal to its own audience\\, but to appeal to a different audience who were not fans of the franchise. \\n\\nIf you're a fan of Star Wars\\, you probably won't like the film. If you're a fan of Luke Skywalker\\, or have dreamed about the possible lore behind Rey's parentage\\, or wondered just who Snoke could be and what his story is\\, well\\, this film is not for you. \\n\\nSo\\, if you like Sci Fi films\\, you probably will like this movie. Star Wars fans should avoid this Star Wars movie as you are not the intended audience. Die in a fire\\, Disney.","true":true}
