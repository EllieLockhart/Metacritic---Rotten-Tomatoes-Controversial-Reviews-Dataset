Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Read the critics critiques. They were way off. Period. Disney had no respect for the childhood admiration for Luke. They turned a childhood idol into a weak \\\"woe am I\\\" whiner.  The writers made Luke (same guy who convinced Han to stay\\, the guy who faced Vader prematurely to rescue his friends\\, they guy who then faced Vader and brought him back to the light) into a childish quitter. Who offers critique of the force and Jedi with no resolution or vision of the future of the force. Bottom line this movie wasted intriguing and compelling story lines. It dispatched an intriguing villain without adding any depth to him. Shallow story plot and storytelling plagued the film. Disney treated this film as a cash grab in my opinion looking to \\\"start fresh and anew\\\" versus building on a rich universe.  Writers could had taken Luke so many directions (ex. had his hope betray him to great disappointment and go to the dark side\\, dismantle the Jedi as we know it and develop a \\\"Grey\\\" Jedi\\, etc).  Not excited for Episode IX.  I will see it once for nostalgia\\, but only once. (Saw Force Awakens\\, 4 times in theaters)","true":true}
