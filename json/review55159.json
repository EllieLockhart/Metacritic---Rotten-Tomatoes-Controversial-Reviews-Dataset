Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this film with no expectations. I had seen Episode 7 and Rogue One and enjoyed them\\, and had avoided all promotional material for this movie.\\n\\nVisually the film is stunning\\, if all you want is to watch a movie with amazing effects\\, this will satisfy you. If you want anything more\\, this movie will disappoint.\\n\\nThe film feels rushed\\, yet it drags on and I found myself bored and begging for it to be over by the end. The first 90 minutes of the movie is a sequence of incredibly short scenes with opposite tones that the movie alternates showing you. One scene is is a gag for laughs\\, and then it immediately cuts to a melancholy scene\\, barely giving you any time to adjust before it cuts right back to another scene. \\n\\nThe movie spends a lot of time on a plot with Flynn and a new character Rose\\, yet their actions amount to nothing of consequence. If they hadn't been in the movie\\, nothing would have been different.\\n\\nWe also get a lot of cute animals shoved in our faces for no clear reason other than to set up toys for Disney to sell to young children.\\n\\nThe film also relies heavily on showing old characters from the previous (original) trilogy\\, just to get nostalgia points but gives them nothing of importance to do other than to be on the screen so your brains like \\\"oh I like Chewy\\, thus I must like this movie!\\\" Yet it also presents these characters in a manner that is so comical it comes off as a parody bordering on insulting. \\n\\nAs a Star Wars movie\\, Episode 8 is bad because it has little to no internal consistency\\, and portrays old characters in insultingly comical ways.\\n\\nAs a movie\\, Episode 8 is terrible due to pacing and tonal issues\\, wasting 40% of the plot on a setup that does not make sense and ultimately amounts to nothing. \\n\\nHonestly\\, save your money.","true":true}
