TLOU1 and 2 both have agendas if you didn't notice .. you have the right to disagree with it but don't deceive others and say that it deserves 0!!All reviews were based on the leaks or the first couple of hours of the game which has a shocking event that make the game make sense imo and even the ending I saw it perfect and it fits Ellie's character 100%On the other hand the game's gameplay is amazing and very enjoyable\\, very few commented on the gameplay which is 80% of the game and I really wished it didn't end\\, and I'd like to play more.Play it .. think deeply about it\\, and don't judge it from only a reaction to one event or one idea ..\u2026 Expand","true":true}
