Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the fan hate\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi goes in bold and emotional new directions that will be remembered for a while. It's also extremely well directed and written. The perfomances are also brilliant as is the Score. I however do take issue with the Finn and Rose dynamic which wasted time and ruined a powerful moment. Luckily however\\, all of the Rey\\, Kylo and Poe plot was satisfying and this subplot eventually became entertaining. Overall\\, without this plot-line\\, it might be my favourite star Wars movie of the franchise\\, but sadly\\, it'll have to sit at second. Go see it\\, it's fricking great: 9\/10.","true":true}
