Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie might have had its good action sequences and a few funny moments\\, but overall it was a poorly planned writing mess and a colossal heap of potential gone to waste. Summarizing: Nobody ever knew whoever was Snoke; right after Kylo Ren betrayed his master he still took the same route as him (Then why tf did he kill him? He wasn't obviously after power); the whole Luke holograph thing ended up killing him\\, so why on Earth would he have done that\\, anyway? Wasn't that supposed to make him avoid the same fate as Obi Wan Kenobi? Oh\\, and let's not forget the infamous Space Mary Poppins scene courtesy of Leia. Pretty sure Carrie Fisher overdosed to death because of the mess this movie is and the dishonour they made to all the old Star Wars characters. J.J. Abrams deserves to be called Jar Jar Binx.","true":true}
