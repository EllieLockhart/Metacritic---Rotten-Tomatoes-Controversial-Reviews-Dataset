Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"lets just start of and all agree that Rian Johnson was an extremely poor choice of director here. Obviously the Disney executives wanted a 'yes' man and someone easy to manipulate. The story is extremely messy and incoherent with deus ex machina happening way more then it needs to. Many of the questions introduced from the force awaken remain un-answered or completely fobbed.  I'm sorry but the critics consensus on Rotten Tamatos is complete utter bullshit this is a bad movie at every level except for some slight redemption from the action sequences. I do not think Rian Johnson will be taken seriously as a director on any project moving forward after this and he will probably change his name to Alan Smithee. Such bad writing\\, such bad scripting. I honestly feel sorry for the actors and completely understand why they now want to distance themselves from Disney's Star Wars universe.","true":true}
