Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not posting many reviews lately\\, but I had to post this one because of RT's ridiculously low Audience score.  The Last Jedi was not and never could be as good as the original two films\\, but it was VERY GOOD.  I was thoroughly entertained and loved that I could not guess what was going to happen in each scene (like Force Awakens.) With the possible exception of Rogue One\\, this was my favorite Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back. Go see it and decide for yourself.","true":true}
