Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible film and a shoddy excuse for a Star Wars movie. Not only was the first 2\/3 of the movie just them sitting in space\\, the side plot with Rose and Finn was useless and accomplished nothing. They crashed on the beach for literally no reason\\, getting them imprisoned\\, and leading them to take the knockoff codebreaker instead of the actual one. Rey is a huge Mary Sue again\\, and the other main characters don't accomplish anything. Admiral Holdo was incredibly dumb\\, and made incredibly stupid decisions. The scene where Leia simply flies back into the ship after spending 30 seconds in space with virtually no consequences was most likely the dumbest scene in movie history. The new trilogy is just overated garbage. Do not watch.","true":true}
