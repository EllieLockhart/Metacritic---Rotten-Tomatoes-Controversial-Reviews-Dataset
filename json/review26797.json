Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once you let go of preconceived notions of what Star Wars should be\\, The Last Jedi is thoroughly enjoyable and one of the best in the overall franchise. For those whining about Luke's character\\, I feel they have missed the point. Luke\\, once full of hope is now broken and jaded. He is a man struggling to come to terms with his past actions and what he perceives to be an ultimate failure. This inner conflict adds to his complexity and gives his character a depth that we have not seen in any previous film. Furthermore\\, it's this struggle that makes his redemption that much more satisfying and awe inspiring. Rian Johnson has busted the doors of the Star Wars universe wide open and has provided a blank canvas for future films.","true":true}
