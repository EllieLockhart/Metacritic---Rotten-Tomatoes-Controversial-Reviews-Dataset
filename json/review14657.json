Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have loved this franchise since I was a young boy and went into this film with only the expectations left by The for awakens. What I got was a huge disappointment on many levels. The new writer director gave the middle finger to everyone and pissed on fans. It tore apart all that was good about TFA. It ruined a story with such promise with rediculous ideas that didint work. Basically a hour of nonsense with stuff blowing up and convalutted story lines this film is A mess and Luke Skywalker deserved better as do the fans. It might be a visual spectacle but the story made no sense and if since most of the canon has been thrown away thanks to Disney\\, I'll be throwing this POS out with it.","true":true}
