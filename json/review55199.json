Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would say lets see how I feel after the next one......but\\, this movie has so many other problems that will  make no difference.  Many plot holes\\, by a hack writer\/director. So a slow chase is exciting? Finn and Rose take off in their own ship to a casino planet.....and some how catch up with the first order\\, but wait the first order can not even keep up with the resistance. eyes roll. This film is not brilliant\\, it is a fan film submitted by someone who never seen a star wars film (or even the previous installment) Nice job Disney\\, you out did George Lucas on fan backlash. I never seen the amount of hate so soon after. I do not care about future movies\\, or there theme park land or anything. Disney left a nasty taste in my mouth. Why give Rian Johnson his own separate trilogy? This one didn't even fit in the current trilogy.  Mark Hamill deserved better writing. When DC makes a bad superman movie\\, people get upset\\, but\\, at the end of the day there will be more. Superman always get remade\\, with a new actor.....there is only ONE Luke Skywalker\\, one shot\\, and they blew it. Watch they recast him next with someone who doesnt asks questions. These movies had one goal\\, get rid of everyone George Lucas signed on before selling to Disney. Its a shame\\, so much potential .","true":true}
