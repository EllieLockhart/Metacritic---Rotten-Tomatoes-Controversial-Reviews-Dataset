Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*sigh*  Saw the first at a theatre in 1977\\, Indianapolis\\, IN.  The first six were absolutely phenomenal.  Unfortunately\\, #8 (skipping #7)\\, was a complete disappointment.  Rambling\\, nonsensical musings with some strange humor mixed in\\, left me\\, and apparently many others\\, wanting.  They sold Luke Skywalker short in this movie...so much potential\\, so little creative prose.  What I found fascinating....as the movie ended\\, you could clearly hear collective moans and a spattering of delightful applause at the same time.  That's what I love about the human being....diversity in thought.  Methinks that the third in this trilogy will be much better...I hope.","true":true}
