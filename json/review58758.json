Some parts of the game definitely could've been written better (especially the first few hours)\\, and I think the structure\/pacing of the game could've been improved. However\\, overall\\, the story was still very engaging to me\\, and although it wasn't as good as the story in TLOU1\\, I really enjoyed it. A big change in the middle of the game caused a lot of outrage in some people\\, but this change worked for me\\, as it was crucial for the story to be told.\r\rI'd really recommend this game\\, and it's a shame to see it being review-bombed by people who have only read the leaks or watched out-of-context gameplay online without experiencing the game for themselves!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
