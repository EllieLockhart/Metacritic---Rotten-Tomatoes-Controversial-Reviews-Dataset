Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this 1.5 because it is a very good movie and beautiful. Great action and I even like the modern dialogue and humour. It's a horrible movie to me if you like anything to do with what Star Wars is and apparently was to so many people. I get it that Disney is trying to redefine what the Star Wars \\\"franchise\\\" is and can be but it doesn't mean that I have to like that fact or the products that contribute to that fact. As a Star Wars movie - 1.5 stars and only 1.5 because it took place in the Star Wars universe. I don't have to like the movie just because it is well directed and beautifully shot - because through its story it has ruined what Star Wars means to me. Thanks Disney. But who cares what a 33 year old thinks right??? Out with the old in with the new.","true":true}
