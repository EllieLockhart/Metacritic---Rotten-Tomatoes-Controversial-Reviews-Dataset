Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Came in the very happy to the theater and expected to be AMAZED from the beginning of the movie! \\n\\nTurns out.... it was all a bad joke. \\n\\nI don't know where to even begin with this movie\\, as another reviewer has said\\, it gleefully thumbs it's nose and mocks\\, via feminist and SJW claptrap\\, much of what made Star Wars great. With this movie Rian Johnson makes JJ Abrams look like Spielberg\\, it absolutely boggles the mind that Disney have given him a whole trilogy. \\n\\nYou've got to wonder just what planet these Hollywood types occupy. This most millennial of movies - preachy\\, shallow\\, self satisfied\\, lazy\\, boring and nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is - with a whole act that's completely pointless\\, is chock full of terribly out of place\\, cartoonish humour and laughably bad dialogue - Luke chose the island because it was \\\"the most unfindable\\\" - I kid you not\\, he actually says that. He needn't have worried\\, I highly doubt this insulting hack job will be much sought after in the years to come.\\n\\n But what REALLY\\, DEEPLY\\, disappointed me the most was what Mark Hamill EXACTLY said:\\n\\n\\\"I 'FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH EVERY CHOICE' FOR LUKE IN THE LAST JEDI\\\" \\n\\n\\n...So do I.","true":true}
