Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have some very mixed feelings about this movie:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great cinematography\\n2. New\\, diverse characters\\n3. Interesting parallels to the original trilogy\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Hardcore missed opportunities with both classic and new characters\\n2. Poor character development\\n3. Plot elements that are irrelevant and don't make sense\\, they're just added to make the film longer.\\n4. There is a scene that defies all logic that shouldn't have played out the way it did\\, yet somehow it was thought to be a good idea.\\n5. Rose","true":true}
