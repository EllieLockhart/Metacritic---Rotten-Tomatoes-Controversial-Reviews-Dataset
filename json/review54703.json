{"101487":139154,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this movie -- and yes\\, I love star wars a lot. I managed to avoid all spoilers in the movie by not reading any reviews\\, so that I may be able to see it with an unbiased review. After seeing it and reading several of the reviews\\, I can honesty say some of the fans who reviewed it are full of it. \\n\\nThe Good: The movie went at a decent pace. the story was entertaining\\, had a lot of awesome action sequences\\, pretty good character development\\, and wasn't too long.The movie itself was well done - the graphics were good\\, the music was great (gotta love john williams!). I liked the costume design as well. I actually thought the humor was appropriate and well placed. it's OK to not have a movie that is 100% serious. Some people don't like the \\\"marvel-esque\\\" humor\\, but I thought it was MUCH better compared to marvel. Also\\, do people not remember how campy and corny the old movies were?? I guess so. \\n\\nThe \\\"bad\\\": I put bad in quotes\\, because there's not a whole lot that is actually bad. I think they had a chance to really develop Captain Phasma\\, but\\, it's fine. not the end of the world. I also think they should have had done a little more with Snoke. i glad he met his end at the hand of a certain main character\\, but it would have been awesome to see a good fight. There were a few plot holes (I wish we could have seen a little more of Luke when he was a teacher\\, but again\\, not the end of the world.) It seems that people are upset with plot holes. they CAN be cleared up in other movies. I think Rose's character would have been more meaningful if she were introduced in the last movie. I'm unsure if I want to see a love story between Rose and Finn. seems...pointless. That said\\, I LOVE the genuine love\/best friendship between Finn and Rey. I hope to see more of that in the next movie.\\n\\nSo overall\\, I felt it was an entertaining movie and I cant wait to see the next movies.","true":true}
