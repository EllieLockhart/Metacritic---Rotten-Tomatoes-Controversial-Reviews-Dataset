And that's just the beginning :)\r\rThis sequel has all the wonderful ingredients of the first game. The story is violent\\, but meaningful and the scene is really touching (the interactions between Joel and Ellie are SOOO GOOOD!!).\rThe gameplay is almost FLAWLESS (maybe better than MGS5).\r\rI really encourage all Last of Us 1 gamers to buy this one and to MAKE THEIR OWN OPINION  of the game and especially the story.\r\rI LOVE this game\\, despite some minor questionable choices (some characters are just here to check boxes.. and maybe some of the flashbacks are not necessary.\r\rAt my own surprise\\, Last of Us part 2 became one of my favorite game of all time (and I play since 25 years on PC and consoles!!). It's a MASTERPIECE and I thank Naughty Dog and the wonderful casting for their AMAZING JOB.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
