Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a sequel you can't judge this movie on its own merits alone. Part of the judgement has to be formed based on how well it follows on the movie that preceded it. When you do this you realize: a) there is no cohesive plan for all three movies b) no one at Disney has ever heard the concept of Chekov's gun. The story sways from roller-coaster action to grind to a halt useless social commentary. Way too many pointless\/useless characters. A mess of a story. Yes the movie is visually impressive\\, however eye candy alone is not enough. I don't understand how Disney gets Marvel so right but Star Wars so wrong.","true":true}
