Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney was given an amazing opportunity to make something amazing and this was the biggest disappointment of the series.  I never thought something could make me feel worse than The Phantom Menace\\, but this did.  So many plot holes\\, the space race didn't make any sense\\, Admiral Holdo was the worst\\, this was just the most shallow shitty portrayal of the Star Wars universe since the holiday special.","true":true}
