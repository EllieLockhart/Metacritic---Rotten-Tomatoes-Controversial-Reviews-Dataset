Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's basically shiny garbage with amateur writing\\, gaping plot holes\\, pointless shallow characters and sub plots and ridiculous decisions made by someone who I assume has never actually watched any previous film in the series. \\n\\nIts a bad star wars movie\\, but it's also just a bad movie. I have literally no idea what the critics were thinking in rating it so highly.\\n\\n....... And it still can't help but be derivative of empire strikes back. Write something new and complimentary for gawds sake!\\n\\nI didn't hate the Porgs though and there were a few good ideas\\, Mark Hamil in particular tried his best to make it better so this one star belongs to them.","true":true}
