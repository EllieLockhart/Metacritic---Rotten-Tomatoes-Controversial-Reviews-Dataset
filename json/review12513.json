Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why this film has people so divided. It subverted the usual Star Wars plot tropes\\, whilst still having a fantastic soundtrack and visuals. Even if you end up not liking the plot\\, it will engage you for its sheer unpredictability.","true":true}
