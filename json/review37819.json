Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were several narratives going on through out the film. Yet\\, what I found was the most interesting aspect was the inclusion of an economy to the series. Most importantly it expressed that despite the triumphs between the good and the bad. There were people behind closed doors making a killing.","true":true}
