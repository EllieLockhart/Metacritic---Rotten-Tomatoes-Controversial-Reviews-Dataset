Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An evolution of the story that will stand as an important pivot in the canon. Characters with real depth and stuggle\\, trying to understand and define themselves uniquely in a seemingly binary universe. Will see it again and again.","true":true}
