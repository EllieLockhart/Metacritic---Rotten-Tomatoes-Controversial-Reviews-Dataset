Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars feel: (8.7\/10)- John Williams score was as good as any of his previous works\\, on par. The scenes\\, and shots fit very well into the story arc of the whole saga. The diction of characters we have known for 40 year\\, and the one's we have known for 2 are spot on\\, can't give Rian enough credit here.\\n\\nSequences: (10\/10) - Both practical and digital effects were done at the highest level\\,choreography was perfect\\, the film recreated the galaxy we all know and love again.\\n\\nPlot: (10\/10) Although I hear and understand the criticisms of this aspect from others I cannot help but feel it was the strongest plot line we have seen for some time in the galaxy far far away. The choices of the characters are genuine brilliance. The story told through these wonderful characters couldn't be predicted\\, Some drag in the F\/R scenes\\, but told of the risks soldiers take with uncertain outcomes. Ties VII in but not too much due to its taking place immediately after. The story that needed to be told was told.\\n\\nCharacter development: (10\/10) The choices were genuine if you didn't agree with them you still knew they were real.","true":true}
