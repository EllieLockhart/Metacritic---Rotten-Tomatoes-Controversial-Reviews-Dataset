Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a slaughterhouse for the ideals and characters built up over the course of a decade.\\n\\nMany claim that \\\"as a standalone movie it would be 4 or 5 stars.\\\" Even THAT is false. The plot is illogical. There is nothing likable about the characters. The movie was overly long and just flat out boring. I was checking my watch to see when I could leave the movie that the 5 year old sitting in front of me could have easily written.\\n\\nIf we get past the butchering of Luke\\, the death-defying rocket Leia\\, the trashing of Kylo Ren's character development\\, cheesy humor that only has place on Disney Junior\\, and all of the plot holes\\, this movie feels just like a political statement by the libs at Disney.\\n\\nAlmost all of the bad guys were white males. Almost all of the good leaders were women. I like to see a fair 50-50 movie. You know\\, equally male and female. This wasn't that. I felt strapped down with 50 gallons of new-age feminist agenda shoved down my throat. It's a shame.\\n\\nFor as long as I can remember\\, I've loved Star Wars. Like millions of others\\, I had the movies\\, read the books\\, played with the toys and games\\, and I was excited to have Disney continue it on. It had a lot of potential. I don't know how they could have done this poorly. It's astounding.","true":true}
