Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the movie\\, overall I think there were both very good and very bad decisions on both ends. However\\, the bad decisions made completely overshadow most of the good parts of the movie. In a rush to try and bring forth a new age of Star Wars\\, the filmmakers ignore extremely good opportunities to create a revolutionary film. With Disney getting involved and the SJW movement being so prevalent it was foolish of me to think that these ideals would be excluded in this film. This film while unpredictable makes bad choices and cuts out ideas that would have made this movie exceptional. As an addition\\, the jokes for comedic relief and the plot armor that I have seen is among the biggest mistakes I see in this movie.","true":true}
