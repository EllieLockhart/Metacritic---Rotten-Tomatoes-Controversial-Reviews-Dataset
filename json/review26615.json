Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay. It was a bit of a let down. It has cool moments and great images. The comedy was fun but a bit much for a Star Wars movie. Half of the time it felt more like a Harry Potter movie to be honest","true":true}
