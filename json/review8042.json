Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fans who are up to their noses in the non-canon novelisation lores will hate it because this movie takes Star Wars lore to another level but but not in the unrealistic ways as in Starkiller or Revan lores. Rian Johnson gambled and paid off with a raw\\, new and beautiful product that will please the audience but anger the fanatics.","true":true}
