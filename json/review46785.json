Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

The character started to developing. And we all don't know what's gonna happens in the next movie. Maybe Rian is already prepare something big? Or mind blowing? Who knows?
