Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A let down\\, to say the least. It genuinely felt like Rian Johnson watched a bunch of Marvel movies while writing this. The jokes are awful\\, the arcs for existing characters were disappointing\\, and the new characters fell flat. And say what you will about the prequels\\, but I would take any of those stories over this chaos.","true":true}
