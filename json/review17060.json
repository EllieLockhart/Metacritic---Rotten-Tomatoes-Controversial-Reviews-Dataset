Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. Great fun for kids.\\n\\nI  see some 'grown-ups' do not like the movie\\, which is odd as it is a kids film with a 12A certificate in the UK!\\n\\nI'm looking forward to seeing it again in 3D.","true":true}
