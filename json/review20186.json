Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok\\, but the reveal of Rey's parents was...stupid to be honest. And Luke..he felt weird. The moment of fear fueled weakness where he almost killed his nephew was so out of character. The B-Plot was slow and plodding. And I didn't much care for Rose at all.\\n\\nI'm a mixed bag on this film. I didn't hate it\\, but I certainly didn't like it like I did TFA.","true":true}
