Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very surprising and disappointing addition to the films. The Force Awakens and Rogue One each got 2 theater viewings from me... but what the heck happened with this installment? I'm not one to usually write reviews or give harsh ratings (I'm a pretty casual movie goer)\\, but after thinking about this movie since seeing it I had to sign up and rate it. Of all the Star Wars stories that could have been told this movie takes a very different direction\\, which may not have been bad if the writing didn't feel lackluster and if the plot was more rounded and polished (instead of the hollow\\, plot-hole-filled-CGI-extravaganza we received). Definitely not of the 91% or 8.1\/10 caliber currently on RT.","true":true}
