Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Edit: I came back to put 1 star review cause 1\/2 star reviews don't reflect the audience score.  Rotten Tomatoes should review thier 'professional' critics for being paid shills.\\n\\nI don't watch much movies at the theater\\, I regret watching this one. James Gunn should take over\\, Guardians of Galaxy vol 2 is the best sci fi film of the year with 1\/100 the IP of star wars.  If I was a Disney shareholder\\, I would be VERY concerned about the CEO who chose her political ideology over profits. How many BILLIONS did it cost by the mismanagement of Han's death? and of Luke's death? Both of their death's should of had the audience in tears. They both deserved a glorious death and funeral like Yondu's.","true":true}
