Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is decent on the surface until you notice that it really didn't continue any of the story from the force awakens. Audience left with more questions and no satisfying answers.","true":true}
