Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an insult to me. So illogical and totally messed up all previous settings in Star Wars. I personally won't recognize this episode as part of the official series. So this is how Star Wars die\\, in thunderous applause.","true":true}
