Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. I went to see it a second time and enjoyed it even more. I feel this movie is getting a lot of hate because it\u2019s not what people expected and it goes against the traditional Star Wars mold. They needed to do that to keep this thing going as they are planning for a ton of new movies. They needed to give the characters more depth and show the good guys can fail and show Star Wars wasn\u2019t just about lightsabers. You just can\u2019t win with people as so many were upset about TFA being a copy of a New Hope but then when they give them something new and refreshing\\, people complain and get upset that it didn\u2019t go the way they thought it would.
