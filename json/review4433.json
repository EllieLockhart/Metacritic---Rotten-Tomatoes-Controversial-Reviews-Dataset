Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Certainly Disney-fied. Pretty to watch. Spoon-fed nostalgia. Strange\\, almost uncanny combination of too-perfect and too-lazy editing\\, directing and screenwriting. Some fun\\, unexpected cameos...some poorly chosen. Felt a bit like some stolen plot points from IV\\, V. And VI","true":true}
