Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the theater\\, I thought maybe I liked this movie.  The visuals we're great\\, the battle scenes nicely done\\, the salt-ice planet was beautiful.  I loved seeing Luke again.  But something felt off\\, I had a bad feeling about this...\\n\\nThe more I thought about this movie the more I grew to dislike it and eventually hated it.  This is on par with the prequels in terms of how bad this movie was made and perhaps even worse in some respects.\\n\\nThere was no continuity in plot from The Force Awakens (or very little); Luke Skywalker turned into Jake Skywalker (agree with Mark Hamill that this was not Luke).  It wasn't that there was a change in character over 30 yrs\\, it's that this character on screen wasn't Luke.  \\n\\nMostly it was because the writer and director (Rian Johnson)\\, who I will never see another movie by him\\, decided to kill everything having to do with Star Wars lore.  He was speaking to the audience and fans through Kylo Ren when he said \\\"let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\".  I could go on and on but what a terrible hatchet job.  Great job Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Rian Johnson in killing Star Wars.  What's episode 9 about \\, who knows and who cares.  I certainly don't","true":true}
