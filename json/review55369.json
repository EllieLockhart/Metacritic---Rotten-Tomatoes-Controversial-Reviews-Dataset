Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. I'm a hardcore fan since I was 7. Grew up with it. Adam Driver's amazing performance is doing for Kylo Ren what Hayden's never did for Anakin. As excited as I was to see my beloved characters and familiar scenery again in The Force Awakens\\, I didn't connect that much with the new characters\\, until... The Last Jedi. Bold\\, surprising\\, exciting\\, and hands down some of the best twists I've seen in years. That whole sequence of Kylo slicing Snoke\\, Rey getting the lightsaber\\, and the kick-ass fight scene against the guards will forever be one of my favorite Star Wars scenes of all times. Leia looks beautiful and kicks some ass herself \\, and the whole Rey \/ Kylo-Ren turmoil\\, connection thing is very interesting and different. This movie confirmed for me why I'm a 100% Star Wars fan. Kudos to Rian Johnson for daring to go in some new directions. And canon fans\\, me included\\, chill and enjoy the ride.","true":true}
