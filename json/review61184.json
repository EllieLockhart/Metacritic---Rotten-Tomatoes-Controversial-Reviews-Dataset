Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Great game. It didn't have the same emotional impact on me as TLOU-1\\, but this game is deeper and deals with more complex emotions.\r\rPros: looks and plays great. Outstanding music and voice acting. Realistic characters.  Some great action sequences. Attention to detail in Seattle\\, and the context-sensitive actions you can do.  Complex story\\, which ended exactly as it should have.

Subsequent playthroughs felt just right\\, though. The narratives on the collectibles were just not as memorable to me as in the first game\\, like when tracking Ish through his notes\\, or the doctor's notes in the hospital.\rPart 2 is also a bit more emotionally draining than TLOU-1.  Gameplay and trophy-hunting is a bit too easy.\rAlso\\, no multiplayer :(\r\rI've completed the game twice\\, once on the Survivor+. I feel if you don't pay close attention to all the game dialogue and information on collectible notes\\, much of what the game is going for will be lost on you.\rIt's definitely a game I'll return to and play favorite chapters and sequences again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
