Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Strange how in the last 24 hours dozens of positive critics have rained into Rotten Tomatoes for this pathetic excuse of a movie after weeks of essentially all negative reviews.\\nDisney must be really scared to hell by the possibility of not selling a single ticket for the next Star Wars movies due to the massive and increasing quantity and quality of negative critics and scores for this abomination called The Last Jedi.\\nThe more I read the positive critics\\, the more I'm convinced they all come from Disney shills\\, paid for attempting a rather pathetic and futile damage control.\\nThey talk about old characters honored by the movie\\, while in reality they have been assassinated and mocked without a single glimpse of respect from the amateur director and feminazi producer.\\nThey talk about the macroscopic plot holes and the complete disregard of SW lore and rules as small imperfections which do not alter the quality of the movie...\\nGuys\\, do a favor to yourselves: if you don't understand anything about cinema in general and SW in particular\\, please avoid commenting here. You only make yourself look foolish and ignorant.\\nYou are defending a movie that will stain Disney's reputation forever.","true":true}
