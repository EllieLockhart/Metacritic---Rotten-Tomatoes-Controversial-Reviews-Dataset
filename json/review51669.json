Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A depressing film where the heroes scurry like rats for 2 1\/2 hours and almost nothing good happens\\, interspersed along the way with odd hit or miss humor. For the life of me\\, I have no idea why people think this movie is so good... it really wasn't IMO. The old is torn down and sacrificed to the new\\, and Rey is diminished. We get half a movie focused on a pathetic emo\\, entitled\\, psycho\\, murderous manchild who the writers work really hard to want us to care about\\, and almost no one seems to care that Kylo killed a true hero\\, his own father and has slaughtered countless innocents. Glad I saw it for free. I think I'm done with Star Wars... and I LOVED ep VII\\, and have been going opening day since IV. Disappointed and sad.","true":true}
