Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know why people are hating on this film. It has great acting\\, a remarkable script\\, and it was adding a lot more to the lore was personally I thought was ten times better than the extended universe ","true":true}
