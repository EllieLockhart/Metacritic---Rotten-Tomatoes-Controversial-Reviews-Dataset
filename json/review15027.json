Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I KNOW that the cast is exceptional. They've proven themselves in The Force Awakens and in other films...so my appreciation goes out to them for their work. As a fan\\, thank you to the cast. The writers and the director ruined this movie... JJ has a huge mess to clean up in IX. We'll see if that's even possible.","true":true}
