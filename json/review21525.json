Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would rather watch \\\"The Room\\\" or \\\"Disaster Movie\\\" than this horrible film for a 2nd time. The main plot is boring\\, the side plot is a complete waste of time\\, the characters are either been wasted (Finn\/ Luke\/ Leia\/ Poe\/ Phasma(again!) \/Snoke ) or unbearable (Rey\/ Kylo\/ Rose\/ DJ) . Their motivations are either unreasonable or not existing at all. Asking yourself why this or that character is doing what he\/she does the answer is - the plot demands it. I know R.J. had nothing to work with but to see how many \\\"Gotcha\\\" moments he could fit into one single movie was not a good call. the film was an abomination. The good thing is though - I've learned to apprechiate the Prequels more. Even Episode II.","true":true}
