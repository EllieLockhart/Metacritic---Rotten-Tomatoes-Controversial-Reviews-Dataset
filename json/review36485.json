Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie\\, although enjoyable at times has so many subplots and characters\\, all of which don't contribute in any way to the plot. Furthermore\\, alot of these characters are majorly down played (asian women and Mark Hammil especially) and the direction they went with for Rey\\, Kylo and Snoke wasn't what many wanted.","true":true}
