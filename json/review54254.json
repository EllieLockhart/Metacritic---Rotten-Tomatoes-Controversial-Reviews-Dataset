Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you watched the original trilogy\\, and loved it\\, if you ever liked any of the extended universe stories\\, if you liked the character of Luke in any way what so ever\\, don't watch this movie. Turn around right now and never watch it. I genuinely wish I had never seen this movie. While visually this is stunning\\, the story is insulting to anyone who enjoyed the star wars universe before Disney bought it.  The story makes no attempt to make logical sense\\, characters we've grown to know and love do things completely against their character\\, and the lore that George Lucas built over the years was completely ignored. This movie seems like the product of a team that had never actually watched any of the other star wars movies\\, only pictures from it\\, because I can not say it enough this movie looks great\\, it looks like a great star wars movie\\, I only wish that it was.","true":true}
