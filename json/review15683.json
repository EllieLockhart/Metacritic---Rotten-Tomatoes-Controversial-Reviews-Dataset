Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. I am a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up \\nwatching my entire life. Me and my brother are embroiled in a huge debate over this movie. There were a few elements that did not grab me but were completely over shadowed by the two main characters storyline. Rey and Kylo story was epic! Adam Driver deserves an Oscar ! I'm not kidding he really does.","true":true}
