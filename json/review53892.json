Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie.  I was a fan of Star Wars ever since I was a kid and now they put this trash heap in theaters.  Reasons:\\n1. Plot Holes everywhere\\n2. Poor character development and editing.  Many scenes had no purpose and could have been left out.\\n3. Horrible script for the actors and story plot (characters seemed out of place and the humor was awful)\\n4. Spoilers... floating Leia\\n5. Spoilers... great idea lets kill off the main antagonist and never explain who he is or where he comes from (sarcasm)\\n6. Spoilers... lets give Rey little to no training and make her a very powerful Jedi (horrible idea)\\n7. Overall goal of the movie was to destroy all the mystery that JJ Abrams established in episode 7 and destroy the saga of George Lucas it seems.\\nI could go on but I'll stop there.  In summary\\, I wouldn't give a dime to Disney for this piece of hot garbage.  No disrespect to the talented actors\/actresses and musicians\\, but the storytellers\\, scriptwriters and the director need to back away from Star Wars.","true":true}
