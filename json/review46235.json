{"101487":193253,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning Spoilers may be present in this review: Firstly this is a beautifully shot\\, produced and acted film\\, and as a standalone science fiction film would probably rate much higher. However as a Star Wars film building on what has come before and what was left in Last Jedi the film is just meh\\, ok and at times just bad. Never have I felt so conflicted about a Star Wars film\\, yes the prequels had far too much CGI and questionable dialogue but for the most part did their job. Here far too many plot points from Force Awakens are papered over or forgotten completely and then there is the filler casino planet which fills exactly just like that filler. The handling of Luke Skywalker character is wrong (I can see why Mark Hamil stated he fundamentally disagreed with everything decided about his character) Kylo Rens turn to the dark side was because Luke thought about murdering him in his sleep his own Nephew. The same Luke who willingly got electrocuted to redeem his father who was one of the most evil people in the galaxy. But here Luke senses Kylo might go bad and goes \\\"better Kill him\\\" the director makes a point throughout the entire film to state that anyone can be a jedi (which I dont have a problem with\\, however when the previous film left clues and hinted that Rey had some form of Lineage that it teased then the reveal in this movie is disappointing)  As for anyone being a Jedi again its a fine story point to make and could have been handled so much better across both episodes 8 and 9\\, instead this movie is in a rush to trash all that has come before under the pretense of being clever\\, and while many will like this the more hardcore Star Wars fans who played the games who read the EU books and comics\\, the fans who tend to keep star wars going when it isnt in the cinema\\, will  likely leave the cinema feeling dissapointed to angry. It feels and looks like Star Wars it is acted great\\, the Yoda appearance was very well done\\, but it simply isnt enough to save this film from the bad taste it leaves in your mouth. After two years of waiting Rian Johnson took what JJ did (safe bet as FA may have been) and threw it away along with much of Star Wars past (also its a safe bet that the kid at the end of the film will be the protagonist for Johnson's Trilogy that he has been given\\, which is part of the problem Johnson clearly wanted to tell a different Star Wars story and I expect when he isnt bogged down by previously established characters he will do well). Its is now up to JJ to try and fix this for Episode 9 but what has really made this new trilogy suffer is now planning or direction and perhaps JJ should have stayed on to make all 3\\, who knows. But sadly Last Jedi is a beautifully made shot and acted mess of a star wars film.","true":true}
