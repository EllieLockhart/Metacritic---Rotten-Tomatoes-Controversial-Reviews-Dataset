Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it tonight with my kids. 40 years since I saw the first. I've loved them all. I'll take the good and the bad. I don't care. We had a great time tonight. Our fellow viewers were energetic. We laughed\\, we clapped. Haven't had this much fun at a movie in a few years.","true":true}
