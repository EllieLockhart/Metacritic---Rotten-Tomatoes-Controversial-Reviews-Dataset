Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot hole is this story\\, no cohesion with the story and mysteries laid out in the first film\\, characters betray there core beliefs with no back story as to why\\, the force works different now than how it used to. Characters are added that serve no purpose to the film\\, the tension\\,mystery and excitement of the OT and that of TFA is gone. Not sure where they go from here\\, and sadly i don't care anymore.","true":true}
