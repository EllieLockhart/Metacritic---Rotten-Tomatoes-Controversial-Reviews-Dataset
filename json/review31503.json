{"101487":168637,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something very weird is going on here. TLJ managed to please critics with universal acclaim but somehow pissed the majority of the Star Wars fans at the same time myself included. So either the critics have been bribed by Disney or the fans are complete idiots...\\n\\nNow on a personal aspect\\, I was entertained but I am pissed because this could've easily been one of the best SW films. The movie in itself was amazing but at the same time a huge disappointment\\, the forced humour\\, the choices of certain characters fate\\, unnecessary scenes etc\\, that's why I have mixed feeling and here are the reasons why I disliked TLJ:\\n\\nSnoke\\, (aka theoretical Darth Plagueis\\, that we shall now call Supreme Leader Snoke the unwise! - not that I wanted him to be Plagueis but it serves my point) is a character who's lived 1000s of years and seen the rise of the empire while hiding in outer rim. His experience in life left him scarred and weakened. How do we know this? From the Aftermath books\\, interviews and explanations from film directors etc. What have we learned about him in the movies until now? Nothing\\, nada. Will we learn anything further about him in the future\\, NO\\, COZ HE'S F*****G DEAD!!! And if we ever had just a bit of information about him in ep.9\\, who'd even care? The supposedly most powerful SW being died like s**t! The death was badass\\, but knowing who the character was supposed to be\\, what a waste my friends\\, what a waste!!! For those who only watch the movies\\, Snoke is a complete enigma. \\n\\nPhasma\\, the new Boba Fett\\, absolute s**t in ep.7\\, even knowing about her cowardly background from the comics and how she makes her choices to save herself first before thinking of the First Order doesn't help. \\\"But do not worry\\, the character comes back more badass than ever in ep.8\\, you'll definitely learn to love her\\\"... well hey\\, why not kill her off? Dies like s**t\\, big fail! No further comment. Please don't bring her back in ep.9\\, that would be the most stupid move!\\n\\nBenicio Del Toro's character\\, whatever his name is\\, you might as well take him out of the movie\\, absolutely useless! Why give a role like that to such an actor\\, f*****g disgrace! Finn and Rose don't even come for him in the first place\\, they just happen to be at the right place at the right time\\, dude opens the door cell like a can of coke (makes you wonder why he's even in there in the first place and why he didn't leave before)\\, happens to stumble on bb8 and magically find their way back to Finn and Rose who are in the middle of nowhere\\, then it turns out he's exactly the kind of guy they need to infiltrate the Supremacy... Facepalm!\\n\\nKnights of Ren anyone? Where the f*** are they? Still no one knows. Will we actually ever know??? At least we now know they are fallen jedi apprentices but come on\\, why even bring them up in TFA in the first place if it isn't to have any visual content about them after? This better be fixed in ep.9 !\\n\\nLeia. Here i was hoping that they would've given her a good and respectful death. She was close to death when in space though it would have been a pretty shitty death in that case\\, but at least Kylo wouldn't have been the one to trigger it. Don't get me wrong I loved seeing her use the force but f*** me dead\\, that angelic return to the ship was pathetic\\, she just got hit by missiles and torpedoes for crying out loud\\, not even a scar!? If you wanted to keep her alive\\, it would've been so much more fitting to show her use some kind of force bubble shield to keep her inside the ship while protecting herself and even other possible crew member\\, RIP Ackbar! How can't they not let her go in peace? How the hell are they gonna deal with it in ep.9? OMG\\, why???\\n\\nLaura Dern as Holdo\\, nice move. Good to have an actress such as her in the movie. \\\"Oh hey\\, I think we should get rid of her...\\\" F*** OFF!\\nNow see\\, this is probably one of the films biggest mistakes. Here was the perfect opportunity for Leia's end with an amazing sacrifice. Because when she dies in ep.9\\, who exactly is going to be worthy of taking her place or at least lead the resistance? Holdo for sure could've been the one! I guess that's too late now\\, gonna have to bring in a new character\\, again...\\n\\nLetting characters live though they should die\\, killing characters though they should live! \\nHow can they trade in Luke's life for Leia's?!? No\\, i'm sorry but no.\\nThat Ben Kenobi fading away death crap is not acceptable for that film and for Luke! He's the most powerful jedi dammit\\, isn't he? I get the fact that he must have felt exhausted after that crazy force apparition thing he did on Crait but dude\\, chill\\, take a nap\\, make some tea or something\\, get some rest\\, don't freaking die like this bro. If he had to die\\, it had to be in ep.9\\, not TLJ\\, period!\\n\\nRey\\, oh boy. After TFA Daisy said the answer to her parentage was hiding in plain sight. The actress said she thought \\\"a lot was answered in The Force Awakens\\,\\\". It obviously wasn't the case. It was gonna be a big reveal in TLJ. It had to be! What\\, excuse me\\, say that again? Your parents are freaking scavengers? Are you outta ya MIND??? While the film was building up i was like\\, yes she actually is Kylo's lost sister\\, that connection they had\\, it was too obvio... oh f*** no\\, heeeeell no. Scavengers? NO!!! \\n\\nYoda\\, yaaaay ????\\nBut they overdid it a bit though. It's a small thing but they should've used him parsimoniously. That force ghost thing didn't look ghostly enough. Anyway that's a detail. \\n\\nRose\\, useless character! Nothing else to say...\\nThe Finn and Rose subplot was completely unnecessary and was a filler.\\n\\nFinn? The dude in front of a f****** fire beam. His ship melting and ting but babes\\, mans not hot!!!\\nJust kill the guy dammit! Oh s**t\\, he the only black character\\, mayday mayday\\, lets be politically correct and bring in the only asian character to save his a**. \\nGay theory unconfirmed??? Thank the maker if it is!\\n\\nFinal thought\\, the real Empire in all this\\, is Disney!\\nThe fact they give us new SW content\\, big thanks.\\nBut where they messed up was from the start. It could only go wrong by rewriting stories taking place after Return of the Jedi because of all the content that was already written for that time frame with Expanded Universe and Legends content. People already had high expectations and ideas of how things would take place after knowing Disney was gonna give us new content about those exact stories. They wanted to mess with what we already had and loved instead of creating a whole new story from the start like they are about to do by giving Rian Johnson full control over a new trilogy.\\nDisney can keep claiming wanting to please all Star Wars fans but it is clear that the aim is only targeted to new fan generations.","true":true}
