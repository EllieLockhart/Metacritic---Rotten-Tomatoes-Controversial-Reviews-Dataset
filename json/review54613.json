Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sure I've seen this before. Rebels in a hidden base being found and attacked by the Empire. A heroic escape thanks to the sacrifice of the brave rebels. A wannabe Jedi doesn't really get trained but still heads off to face the most evil person in the galaxy or turn them to the light\\, but just gets captured instead. Sith apprentice turns on master to rule the galaxy with wannabe Jedi. And the Jedi master who can actually train the wannabe in some kind of convincing and believable way\\, just fades into the force. And that's just the lack of imagination in the story. What on earth happened to Star Wars being the cutting edge of film making. The effects were rubbish. Snoke's throne room looked like a very low budget theatre production with just a chair and a couple of monitors in front of a huge red wall. The guards looked like something from Power rangers. And fought in the same way. And what were those bird things doing. Obviously the cute comic relief. But they looked like puppets from the 1980's not modern day CGI. The whole thing looked cheap and was thoroughly disappointing.","true":true}
