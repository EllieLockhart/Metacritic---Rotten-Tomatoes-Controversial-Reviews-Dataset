Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought that this was an incredible addition to the series. Walking out of this movie I thought this might have been the best Star Wars movie ever. The points they brought up with the pros and cons of the Jedi order as well as the flaws of a Luke who never had a full education in the force or how to train padawans on his own. Rather than lazy storytelling as some claim or poor plot sense as others seek to assure\\, this film provided a perfectly tense base plot in order to follow three different equally stressful but equally interesting and evolving plot lines. Rey's background was exactly what it should've been\\, Kylo's torment is perfectly sensical and an incredibly interesting trait for an antagonist\\, and Finn and Poe both assert themselves as strong interesting characters as the story progresses. Overall I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I ever could and THAT's saying something.","true":true}
