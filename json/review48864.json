Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars anything ever made.  This makes the prequels look fantastic by comparison.  Prior to this movie I saw every single Star Wars movie in the theater at least twice.  After this movie I haven't seen a single Star Wars movie in a theater.  I was going to go see Rise of Skywalker but re-watched all movies (in timeline order) before it came out and re-watching Last Jedi killed my enthuasm again.  Rian Johnson should never have been allowed to make this disaster of a movie and better never be allowed near any Star Wars produciton in the future.","true":true}
