Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite some WTF moments (Leia as Peter Pan being the most disturbing) and some narrative arcs which while developing characters add nothing to the plot\\, this is one of my favorite Star Wars flicks. Seeing Luke failures as a teacher\\, Rey and Ren struggle\\, epic battle scenes... this is was Star Wars is all about : make you feel\\, react\\, think and discuss. Served by inventive shots and some incredible imagery (although 20 mins could have been cut)\\, hated by most of my friends\\, I love this episode because it helps us undersand why we loved the first trilogy.","true":true}
