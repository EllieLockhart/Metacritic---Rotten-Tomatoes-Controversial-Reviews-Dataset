Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is not only disrespectful to the first and it's respectable characters but the writing is just everywhere it feels at best like a fanfiction fever dream by Neil druckmann. To anyone who loveed the first game just like me I highly recommend not playing this as it will ruin not only your memories of the game but ruin the story. Start the game as normal in town you're the Talk of the Town because he kissed a girl and wow okay nothing to do with zombies nothing to do with the first story so let's let's get on with it secondly you leave leave Jackson a small community Town put together by Maria Joel's brother's wife. You leave to go on patrols which was pretty cool and makes sense you want to control around the whole surrounding area in case any infected get to close it quickly switches to this unlikeable character named Abby an overly muscular girl  I think  as they said they did not want to portray gender in this game  for some reason which makes us scared to look really stupid and dumb  and someone I wouldn't want to play as picture Jordan Vaughn Stranglehold from Fairly Odd Parents mixed with the likeness of the boy who played in the reboot in Rob Zombie's Halloween movie the whole reason of her story from what I can muster because I couldn't find myself to finish this game even though I know what happens is she's getting revenge for Joel killing her parents now there's nothing wrong with a good Revenge story but when you're playing as Ellie you go on a murderous Rampage and kill almost everyone except responsible except for Abby. As for the game play you'll hear a lot of positive feedback that's because they didn't change the formula which is amazing they did update the graphics and some mechanics which was also a change of pace but this proves that game play can't and will not be the only thing that drives the game I've been waiting and a lot of people have been waiting 7 years for this game only for Neil druckmann and naughty dog to s*** on us it is unbelievable I feel like this is a nightmare I encourage you guys definitely to watch more reviews Maybe on YouTube and see for yourself just do not play the game thank you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
