Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very weak\\, inconsistent story line. Mired with political agenda\\, and terrible plot holes.\\nThis is a terrible way to bring the Skywalker saga to it's penultimate close\\, and no doubt has alienated a large portion of the audience who just wanted to watch another Sci-Fi romp across the galaxy\\, and instead were force fed a bowl of poltical bantha fodder!\\n\\nVeiwer avoidance advised!","true":true}
