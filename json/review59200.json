This game is difficult to stomach sometimes. It's really distressingly sad\\, it's unforgiving\\, and it forces you to think about things that you don't want to think about. But that's what makes it special.\r\rWhen I saw the trailers for the game\\, I imagined a simple and sweet revenge story. Ellie and Joel going across the county to kill someone who had killed someone they loved. That isn't what this game is\\, and it's a better game for not just being that. My simple fan-fiction version of the narrative is easy to stomach\\, it's black and white and it doesn't have any depth to it.\r\rThe Last of Us 2 does the opposite. Instead of offering an easy to digest revenge fantasy\\, it forces you to see a bigger picture from different perspectives. It forces you\\, the player\\, to do things as characters in the game that are reprehensible\\, and with knowledge that we have but the characters don't\\, it can be incredibly hard to stomach. When the credits finally rolled on the ending of the game\\, I spent hours thinking about what had happened over the course of the story. I don't know if I've ever played a game that made me think as much as this did.\r\rIs it a happy\\, easy to digest narrative that everyone will enjoy? No\\, it's definitely not. But it's a deep\\, thought provoking tale about loss\\, anger\\, revenge and forgiveness. It's a story\\, like the first game\\, about characters making the wrong choices for love and not knowing if they can live with the consequences. Yes\\, I understand why so many people didn't enjoy this game. It forces you to live in the shoes of people who have been wronged\\, and to understand them. It forces you to question the decisions that characters you love have made. It forces you to think. And not everyone wants to do that.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
