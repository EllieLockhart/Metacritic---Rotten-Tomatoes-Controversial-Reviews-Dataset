The Last of Us was a masterpiece\\, through and through with incredible character development and one of the most bittersweet endings I've ever experienced.Now... I won't get into specifics about the story of The Last of Us 2\\, but all you need to know is that it is an incredible disappointment. There is borderline zero character development. It takes the ending of the first game and renders it pretty much pointless What could have been an incredible experience devolved into a sorry ridden with clich\u00e9s that is unengaging\\, predictable\\, and all around boring. The resolution of this game? Bland. And again\\, heartbreakingly predictable. There are no lessons learned. There is violence\\, but no meaningful conflict. Physical\\, mental\\, emotional\\, spiritual\\, or otherwise. I am beyond disappointed\\, and I hope Naughty Dog will learn from their mistake. From the sound of it\\, though\\, they don't see a problem with their \\\"game\\,\\\" if it even deserves to be called that.  0 out of 10\\, without a doubt.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
