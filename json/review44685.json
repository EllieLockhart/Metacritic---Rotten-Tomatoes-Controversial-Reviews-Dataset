Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To the lucky ones who haven't seen this movie yet - don't! Just watch Rogue One again. On the bright side\\, it's a politically correct experience\\, not-too-heavy on the dialogue\\, with teenage romance throughout - a multicultural love triangle even. I imagine the recipe for such \\\"brilliance\\\" was to pack a room with progressive liberals and focus-group them until death do us part. This resulted in a final product empowering all the right groups (think Hillary and Angela Merkel as rebel commanders) and dishing out justice to dumb-ass\\, testosterone-filled dirt bags (Luke Skywalker included). Me? I should've watched Thor Ragnarok for the fifth time instead.","true":true}
