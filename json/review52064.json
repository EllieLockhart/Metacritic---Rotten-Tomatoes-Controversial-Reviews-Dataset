Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After rewatching The Force Awakens\\, I think the Fore Awakens was a more tightly-constructed film\\, but ultimately it was still more or less a really well-made remake of A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. The Last Jedi was a little more uneven\\, but so much more interesting and unique. I feel much more invested in both Rey and Kylo Ren than I did after watching The Force Awakens. I loved it!","true":true}
