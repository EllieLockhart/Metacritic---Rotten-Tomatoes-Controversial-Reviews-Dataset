Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weak storyline only compounds this movie even further.  If you don't think about anything and just want to see explosions and flashing lights\\, its \\\"great\\\" (like Transformers).\\n\\nIf however you want a great story with character development or arcs\\, don't look here.  Plot-holes for days\\, actions by characters serve no purpose in moving the story along.  Forced one-liners to sell merchandise by Disney only compound the problem.\\n\\nI saw it at the midnight premiere on a Thursday 12\/14\\, and walked out\\, happy to see it\\, but internally conflicted as to what I just saw.  The movie's plot seems to steal from Empire Strikes back\\, but then it works in a pointless ~19hour sub-lightspace chase? Why not send a ship or 2 ahead and blockade the fleeing rebels? A casino world? Weak buildup to characters that are killed off before we even learn who they are.  I'm rambling right now\\, and believe me\\, this is what the movie felt like.\\n\\nThat's all.  Disappointing\\, this just spells Disney marketing\\, a franchise kept alive to suck dollars from people buying merch.","true":true}
