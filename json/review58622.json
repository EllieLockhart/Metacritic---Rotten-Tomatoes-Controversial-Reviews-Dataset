The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Yes\\, I didn't like the story of the game\\, unfortunately... (In technical terms\\, the game is beautiful\\, has great mechanics and gameplay\\, but it contains several bugs\\, even in cutscenes. But I'll focus on the story here.)Don't get me wrong\\, I respect those who liked the game.The main point that everyone is discussing is the death of Joel\\, and my main problem with it is the way it was executed. A series of script conveniences\\, coincidences and even mischaracterization of the characters (Joel and Tommy)\\, broke the game for me. People who liked the game generally argue that the two \\\"softened\\\" and are more sensitive to life in Jackson\\, so they made the mistakes and actions that culminated in Joel's death. (at least here in Brazil\\, where I am from\\, people are saying that a lot)The problem is that this is not presented at any time and is nothing more than a deduction that seeks to justify the script. And having to justify a script is also a problem. I believe that the two characters\\, even more sensitive\\, would still know what to do and what not to do in a situation like that\\, and because they have people they care about now\\, they would not let their guard down.Not considering the convenience of the script that makes Abby saved just by whoever she looks for and wants to take revenge on\\, and other coincidences that take Joel and Tommy to her camp\\, the death scene is all very strange. The two unarmed\\, surrounded by armed strangers and in military clothes. Tommy positions himself close to the wall on a piece of furniture with a view of everything that is happening\\, and Joel walks to the middle of the room with his back turned\\, completely vulnerable and surrounded. The two make the same mistake a second time: naming their real names. For the second time... Abby then pulls out his Shotgun and Tommy who has a view of the whole room does nothing (error of direction that makes the character only see what the camera sees) and the rest we already know\\, Joel dies as if he were no character important. Ellie's arrival at the mansion is also quick and very easy. Where was the rest of the infected horde that chased Joel\\, Tommy and Abby? And the game itself admits this facility by Owen's character who complains that no one was on guard at the other entrance to the mansion\\, when Ellie arrives. And that was just about Joel's death\\, imagine the rest of the story...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
