Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They made a great work with the visual in the movie. Nice effects and so on... When it comes to everything else - they blew it completely... To me this is not a Star Wars movie. This goes for the previous movie aswell \\\"The force awakens\\\". \\\"Star Wars\\\" may be included in the title and there are Star Wars caracters in the movies but still\\, it\u00b4s not Star Wars. I feel like Disney has really done something ugly to all Star Wars fans - they bought the rights so that they could produce this movies in the name of Star Wars\\, made it different in a way THEY wanted it and not how the FANS wanted it and now they make lots of money on the Star Wars rennom\u00e9\\, not on good performance with the knew movies (except for Rogue One - I think they did a great job with that one).","true":true}
