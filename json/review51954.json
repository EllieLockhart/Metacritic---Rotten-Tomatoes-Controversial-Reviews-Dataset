Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A franchise that has lost its soul: sacrificing action for characterization\\, special effects for dramatization\\, and convenience for cleverness.  People trashed George Lucas unfairly; Lucas at least had originality in his trilogies and the characters had story archs (the originals being based on mythology and the prequels having political messages). What is the point of the new Star Wars movies? Thus far\\, to be formulaic conveyor belt films to make more money. It's no longer Star Wars; Disney should have listened to George Lucas or at least had him involved with their projects.","true":true}
