Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great mess. Not only a terrible Star Wars Movie\\, but one of the worst movies released in 2017. Plot holes\\, lazy writing\\, bad characters\\, awful jokes... If you managed to watch this entire crap\\, you are a hero.","true":true}
