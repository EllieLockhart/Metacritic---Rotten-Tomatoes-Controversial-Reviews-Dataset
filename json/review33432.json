Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tedium. The dialogue was flat\\, character development was nonexistent\\, and there was a lot of wasted time. The attempted humor made me think I was watching a movie for 5 year olds. Also Poe wasn't a real character. Poe had no personality he was a plot point they forced down our throats\\, followed by pink hair getting everyone killed because she\\, for no reason\\, didn't want to give people hope.  I want the writers of Star Wars to know that this if the first movie review I have ever done\\, because I was so disappointed with a series that I loved. This movie felt like a slap in the face to Star Wars fans.","true":true}
