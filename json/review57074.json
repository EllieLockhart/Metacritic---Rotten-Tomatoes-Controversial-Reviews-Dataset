Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was overall disappointing with a plot bogged down by twists that failed to surprise in a satisfying manner. Every moment of rising tension was squashed by unnecessary\\, cheesy attempts at humor\\, and there were a lot of moments that seemed silly and impossible for even a fictional universe filled with magic and laser swords. \\n\\nIt left every question posed by The Force Awakens either unanswered or disregarded as meaningless nonsense. For a film that picked up right where its predecessor left off\\, the characters seemed to have entirely different personalities.\\n\\nThe character development was as unconvincing as the story and its setting\\, new characters were entirely underwhelming\\, and the legacies of previous major characters were brushed aside.\\n\\nSave for the very brief return of a former major character\\, there isn't much positive that I can find to say about this film from an objective standpoint\\, let alone as a fan.","true":true}
