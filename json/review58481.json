Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of this feels like typical Rian Johnson. Trying to be edgy\\, turn things on their head when really he's just saying he doesn't care about his subject matter. He's the wrong director for a franchise\\, nothing he's done so far points to him being the guy for something like star wars. I will say there were a lot of visually pleasing scenes in this movie\\, but there were a few odd looking effects. The handling of the established characters is quite insulting in my opinion. I know we need to focus on the new generation\\, but I feel that Luke especially has been shat all over. I never loved TFA\\, but it did set some things up. Johnson has come along and decided he doesn't care about that stuff\\, so it's scrapped. We're now at a point where we're two thirds into a trilogy and we haven't got anywhere. JJ is going to have to reestablish a narrative and resolve everything in one final movie. Johnson wanted to make his mark with his own movie\\, and doesn't seem to care that it's part of a whole universe of film and more. What we have here calls many previous things into question and rips us out of that galaxy far far away. Back to reality. Thanks Rian. Looking forward to your trilogy...","true":true}
