Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can we take a movie that makes a laughing stock its villains in the first minute of it\u00b4s runtime seriously ? the scene with Hux and Poe was so bad I felt ashamed. The humor in this movie is so innapropriate\\, it angers me. This is not a Marvel movie\\, this is Star Wars. Dramatic and potentially beautiful moments are devalued by this terrbily childish sense of humor. Also\\, what purpose does the Rose and Finn on Canto Bight part serve ?! it is a terrible world that feels so unlike Star Wars\\, what a waste of money to design als these creepy persons and dresses..and then to have horses sorm a casino ?!!! WHY WOULD ANYONE HAVE TO SEE SUCH A RANDOM\\, UTTERLY POINTLESS THING in a Star Wars movie ?? Leia floating\/flying through space was downright bizzare\\, I felt it violated the memory of Carry Fisher.  the only good thing is Adam Driver as Kylo Ren\\, now mostly known as Ben Solo\\, whose acting is just superb.The connection and short team-up between him and Rey was close to being a saving grace for this movie\\, but it wasn\u00b4t given enough time to develop.  Still this can\u00b4t get me over the cheap waste of Snoke\u00b4s character. Why show his enormous ability in the force\\, when he is that easy to kill ?!?! WHAT WAS THAT. I could go on forever\\, but I need to let go of my hate\\, because the things you hate stay with you forever ...and I want to be free of this pain that is this movie.","true":true}
