Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, im shocked and angry. This was just so bad. As a true fan\\, this was not the star wars we all were build up for in TFA. What about the KoR? what about Ackbar? Luke's character was so badly written I will never forgive Rian for what his interpretation of this universe is. So selfish\\, not listened to the fans at all! Wow\\, I hope the opening crawl for Ep. 9 will be \\\"forget what you just have seen\\, we apologize\\\"","true":true}
