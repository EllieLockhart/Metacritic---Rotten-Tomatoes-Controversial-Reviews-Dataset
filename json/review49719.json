Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Writing was sloppy\\, CGI in some scenes was off even for ILM\\, characters were not consistent from previous films. Its a shame\\, say what you want about TFA but it did set up the 2nd installment of this trilogy for some cool stuff but this movie took a giant dive off a cliff. Let's hope JJ can course correct for episode 9.","true":true}
