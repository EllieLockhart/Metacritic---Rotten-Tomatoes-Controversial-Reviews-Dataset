{"101487":170215,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-02-28","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is directed and written by Rian Johnson\\, and it stars Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill\\, John Boyega\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Adam Driver\\, and Oscar Isaac in a epic space opera film about Rey (Daisy Ridley) actually finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)\\, and is learning a lot from him\\, while an attack is going on Leia's (Carrie Fisher) ship. Even though I was disappointed in last year's Rogue One\\, I was still excited to see this because I love The Force Awakens\\, and Rian Johnson is taking over this film\\, which gives me some hope and optimism. The only thing that was going on however\\, is that it took a while for me to actually watch it because I wanted to watch it with my mom\\, who is a fan of Star Wars\\, and we had to find the right time to watch it together. So after a vacation was done and over with\\, we finally went to go see this movie\\, and we honestly love this one. The acting is great\\, and it always makes me glad to know how right Daisy Ridley is in her lead role when she was unknown at the time because with her strong debut in The Force Awakens\\, she continues to be strong here. Adam Driver is great in this\\, which I never felt that he was just whining in this that some people titled him like \\\"Emo Ren\\\" or something like that. Now for Luke Skywalker\\, I was worried about him before watching the film because there were news that Mark Hamill didn't like the portrayal that Rian Johnson wrote Luke Skywalker\\, and after watching this\\, I can sort understand why because this is definitely a bit of a change of character from what he usually acts as for Luke\\, and I think that's a great way to progress his character. I mean look at Yoda in the original and prequel trilogy\\, he's different after years go by when bad things happened\\, and we already know that horrible stuff has happened from Luke between the original and sequel trilogy\\, it makes sense that we'll get off guard from the way he acts now then he did before. With that said\\, I do think the aspects with Rey and Luke Skywalker is one of the best parts of the film too because the humor is well done\\, it was interesting to see what has changed from him when years went by\\, and there were some investing stuff that goes on around the island that Luke has been living in for a while\\, or just teaching Rey of the ways that he's been taught. The special effects look amazing as they usually do\\, and I'm very happy to see a lot of practical effects in this as we seem to forget that practical effects exist nowadays. The story is its own thing\\, with some similarities to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi\\, and it was an interesting unlike Rogue One where it was mildly interesting\\, but wasn't sucking me in. Now for the Finn and Rose scenes\\, the one that critics criticized this film for it feeling kind of pointless and the the chemistry is not that interesting\\, which at times feel like the prequel trilogy. For me personally\\, I thought it was good\\, I mean it's not the most interesting part of the film\\, but it was fine enough for me that I think was kind of needed in this film. At the first few minutes I was a bit worried as they finish each other's sentences a bit too often\\, but they dropped that aspect afterwards and actually talk to each other\\, which I'm glad because that would've gotten annoying. The fight scenes are amazing\\, which the first one was better than the whole climax of Rogue One because it doesn't linger so much of it that the movie gets tedious. BB-8 got some laughs out of me\\, and the Porgs\\, while feeling like an advertisement\\, are cute and surprisingly not annoying that I'm actually ok with them. There are twists that I like\\, and there were some emotional moments that I found effective\\, almost close to crying at one point. I have only one criticism that I can say that I agree with the critics\\, and that's the villains' characterization. Not all of them were bad as Kylo Ren has great character progression that makes him even more memorable\\, but that's the only villain that we get to know a lot out of. I barely know anything about Snoke which I feel like he's a big enough deal in this that I should at least a bit about him\\, and Captain Phasma wasn't in this movie enough for me to consider her as big of a threat like Boba Fett was in the original trilogy. It's weird for me because in comparison to The Force Awakens\\, there were a few moments that I thought were more satisfying here than Force Awakens\\, but the villains here\\, excluding Kylo Ren\\, were more of an issue here than it was in the first one where I thought the movie is going to build them up character wise\\, that it was starting to become a legitimate problem from me. So I think that The Last Jedi is probably either not as good\\, or up to par with The Force Awakens\\, but I can say that this is at least one of the best Star Wars films since Empire Strikes Back\\, and I'm really curious about how J.J Abrams is going to pull it off with Episode 9 closure wise\\, and the fate of Princess Leia after the Carrie Fisher's passing.","true":true}
