{"101487":131957,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-10-04","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give 0 stars I would have. I went out of my way to sign up and write a review because of this obsurd notion the original bad reviews were because of Russians. I'm in my 30s\\, American and have loved the star wars movies and franchise since my childhood(Games\\, comics\\, toys\\, etc). Star Wars the Last Jedi broke my fandom. I loved Force Awakens\\, I left the theater happy and ready for more\\, I saw it twice\\, I watch it everytime it's on Starz\\, I like Rey\\, Finn\\, Kilo\\, and Poe. Cool characters and with Han Solo there to tie everything together\\, was a great movie\\, not prefect but really great. \\n\\nThe last Jedi is an abomination\\, I went in the movie theater so happy and excited\\, and I left hurt\\, feeling like I was abandoned and that my devotion as a fan was tossed away and I was slapped for watching that. First\\, who is funding the first order? Last movie they had their death star blow up and they come back wealthier and with more ships??? First act boring\\, the bank and forth \\\"comedy\\\" at first seemed out of place\\, the slow bombing run was kinda stupid\\, then Leia \\\"dies\\\" and I thought it was prefect\\, Kilo finger on the trigger but pulls back for his mother\\, and the other fighters finish the job! And then in the cold of space she super man flies? I was shocked and mortified and my theater has very loud laughter at it. Then the purple haired admiral was annoying and the whole slow chase was boring\\, and then with no rhyme or reason a fundamental part of star wars is changed\\, tracking in lightspeed\\, like what? That is a fundamental rule of star wars which is you can't track in light speed. Oh well whatever\\, luke and Rey are on screen for very little time and they are the main characters. Snoke dies which was a moment where the movie could have been saved\\, it was a great screen until Kilo tells Rey she's nobody.... well thanks assholes.... so on to a weird casino world with no fuckin point and a worse chase seen than anything in the prequels. In fact all the prequels worst moments are better than those whole dragged out casino world trash. The \\\"intelligent \\\" narrative which is that money fuels war or wherever was so clich\u00e9 and not needed in a star wars movie. At this point in the showing I hate the movie\\, then purple hair lady says \\\"God speed \\\" she forgot what universe she was in for a moment. It's may the force be with you! Then she does the coolest thing in the movie which is kamakazi her ship into another so the rebels can escape. Only problem is\\, they broke another star wars rule\\, because if lightspeed could be weaponized then you ruin the original movie\\, where you could have kamakazi the death star\\, and I'd you mix it in with droids from the prequels\\, you could have technically kamakazi the death star with droid ship. So nice scene but wrong for star wars. They end on salt hoth where luke projects himself into battle\\, is cool and then he dies. And some orphan kid used the force at the end. When it was over I stormed out and it ruined my whole day\\, I was in shock for 48 hours over what trash I saw. Dumb story\\, killed admiral akbar for no reason and with no time to soak it in. Awful director who had never seen star wars before. \\nIn short I'm not Russian\\, this movie was awful\\, ruined my fandom. And if Ryan Johnson and Disney thought that script was so good \\,they should have made a new scfi movie franchise and test it there. Star Wars is Star Wars\\, you bought it for 4 billion and you broke it. I didn't watch Solo\\, I haven't rewatched TLJ\\, I won't be going to a Disney world in 2019. You all messed up. Bye.","true":true}
