Their use of psychology throughout the intertwined narrative of both Ellie and Abby cannot be passed off as \u201clazy writing\u201d. To make the player walk 5 miles in the shoes of the villain Abby after you as Ellie have wreaked revenge soaked havoc on her friends and faction for the death of Joel isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve experienced in gaming. It\u2019s clever and effective. By the end of a 25-30 hour campaign\\, you have 2 characters on opposing sides of the same coin in a story that deals with not just revenge but the morality of right and wrong and the effects of action and consequence.\rThe motion capture is fantastic\\, the Ellie and Joel flash back scenes are beautiful. New characters are charming but be warned\\, this is not a story for the faint of heart. Emotions will be tested\\, your heart will be pulled out whilst you get kicked in the guts.\rGameplay-  not much new in terms of innovation but a more effective jump button allows for some new traversal options as well as squeezing through gaps to make those encounters a little more exciting.\rProne position has been added which can give players a tactical edge.\rA plentiful arsenal. Both players have a well balanced array of weapons to master.\rUpgrades system has been simplified and crafting and scavenging remain a key component.\rEnvironments are very detailed and beautiful to look at. There\u2019s the photo mode if you are so inclined.\rNew game plus.\rArray of difficulty settings for those inclined to punish themselves.\rAccessibility options are huge for players\\, I have seen visual and audio adaptation demos. I know that these settings are something that the disabled gamers have praised.\r\rI can see why this game has had some negative scores\\, yes it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. Yes Joel is killed early on. Yes Abby\u2019s character model can be distracting at first\\, you need to suck it up and follow the story\\, get into it\\, listen and feel. It\u2019s the only way the game will have meaning. Expectations will be subverted. I hated that phrase on Star Wars last Jedi\\, which I\u2019m still not happy with but it does work here.\rIf part 3 is made I will give this a 9. I wasn\u2019t 100 percent satisfied with the ending. I would have liked a little more on what the future held for Ellie.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
