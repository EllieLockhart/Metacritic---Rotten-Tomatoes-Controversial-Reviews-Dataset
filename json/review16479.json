Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm surprised that this movie is getting so much backlash. I genuinely feel like this is one of the better Stat Wars movies. I'm going to keep it short and sweet\\, it had some meh moments\\, but what it did so right was subvert our expectations. It changed everything about Star Wars and it has created new ground for them to explore. I assume that is why it is getting so much hate\\, because it isn't the same formulaic Star Wars movie. It takes a lot of risks\\, and most pay off. Every Star Wars fan NEEDS to see this movie. ","true":true}
