Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It tried to do to much and ended up running too long. It also seems like there is a lack of any long-term plan for the story and tries to be unpredictable for the sake of being unpredictable. The Force Awakens might have been a copy & paste of a New Hope\\, but at least it resonated emotionally and felt like Star Wars. I can't say the same about the Last Jedi.","true":true}
