Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an absolute tragedy. SPOILERS: This film completely dishonored the legacy of Luke Skywalker\\, turning him into a sniveling coward who sat back and watched his best friend die\\, the rebellion crushed and his sister almost killed. This is not the Luke from any of the previous films. Likewise\\, a two hour story about a rebellion running out of gas!?!?! Really. When three tie fighters can tear apart and destroy the lead cruiser of the rebellion and now we can't catch them hobbling though space?!?! Snoke?!?! Do I even need to go there? The guy never even gets up from a damn chair in his entire existence!!!! Why should I even care\\, I have no idea who he is\\, why should he be feared? Should I talk now about how Rey has had not a single\\, solitary moment of training yet she can take down a half dozen imperial guard and hold off twice the apprentice of the Supreme Leader?!?! Luke cannot even lift a pile of small rocks even though he has been trained by both Obi Wan and one of the greatest Jedi in history\\, Yoda\\, yet Rey can move half a mountain of boulders easily. This is a disgrace to the Star Wars movies. Pretty sad when you make me wish Lucas was back in control.","true":true}
