Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a star wars fan since first grade. Going into the theater for this movie I had high hopes for this movie\\, but it left me disappointed with a bad taste in my mouth. This movie\\, along with The Force Awakens should not have been made. They are cash grabs that don't care about what the fans want to see. They mixed the old characters with the new abd realized that they couldn't coexist\\, so they have started to kill off the old characters that everyone fell in love with and had been waiting to see for almost 40 years. They ruined the happy ending of the original trilogy\\, and by an extension made those movies worse knowing that the characters's lives will all turn to garbage. Even Mark Hamill hates what they've done to his character. This is the worst star wars movie to date\\, and these movies never should have existed.","true":true}
