Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Answers to all the questions you had after you see Force Awakens are either completely omitted or are not satisfying. You can really see that the new director had no idea how to properly follow what Force Awakens built and it seems he has no grasp over the lore of Star Wars. And I say this as a person who doesn't care that much about this franchise\\, but have watched all the movies.","true":true}
