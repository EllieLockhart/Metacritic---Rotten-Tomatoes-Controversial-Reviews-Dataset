Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrible.  As everyone else has already stated\\, there are tons of plot holes\\, there was no continuity from previous stories\\, and the entire universe and memories of the past were ignored or disrespected.  The acting was mostly horrible except for maybe Hamill and Driver.  The writing was sickening.\\n\\nThe worst thing is that this movie obviously has much less than a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\\, but Disney must have coerced them to cap the score at 50%.\\n\\nIt's been at 50% for days even though 90% of the reviews have been extremely bad\\, and yet it doesn't go below 50%.\\n\\nFurthermore\\, they don't let you go back more than about 50 pages even though there are 1800 pages.  Why do you think that is?  It's pretty obvious - If you could see all the reviews\\, you'd KNOW they are lying about the 50% rating.\\n\\nAnd look for my review again a few days after you read it.  I bet RT will have deleted it...","true":true}
