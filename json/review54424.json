Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the characters. I loved the actors' performances. I even thought what they did with Luke's story arc was interestingly fresh (however saddening it was to see). What I did not like however\\, was how jarringly full of stupid this movie was. The plot is essentially moved forward by a string of moments of someone doing something that makes no sense\\, neither to rational thought nor to the Star Wars lore\\, and the audience is left to cringe in horror. \\n\\nOtherwise great acting performances and beautiful special effects are mostly deflated by a lack of narrative substance\\, and by groan-inducing idealistic 'messages' which seem shoe-horned in at odd times during the film (why can't we just be told a good story\\, and not be lectured?). Rey's obvious Mary Sue treatment does not excite things either.\\n\\nAll the buildings blocks for an excellent film are there: A wonderfully acted female protagonist\\, classic fan favourites Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa\\, a positively unconventional bad guy\\, endearing side characters\\, and a budget worthy of only Disney itself\\, and yet\\, this movie refuses to do anything with it\\, apart from a bit of CGI eye candy.\\n\\nIn other words\\, exactly what you would expect from a modern cinema experience\\, so if you're into that you'll be grandly entertained.","true":true}
