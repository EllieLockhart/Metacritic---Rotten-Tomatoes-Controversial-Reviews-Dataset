Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wish I could give it zero stars. Was so disappointing if you're a Star Wars fan. No explanation for any of the questions we wanted answers for for the last two years. By far the worst Star Wars movie! Screw Disney!","true":true}
