Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the very first time\\, watching this Star Wars movie gave me more questions than answers. I don't blame the actors but I do find fault with the script\/storyboard. This movie just makes no sense at all! The writers and directors\/editors really did a poor here. I won't go into details\/spoilers but if you are going to watch this movie without a care\/relations with the other previous episodes you will be fine because it's funny. However if you are a Star War die hard. it's hard trying not to connect the dots while watching this movie. \\n\\nIt's like Disney is more interested to captivate the younger audience then the existing Star War die hards\\, which to me is a mistake because the original trilogy gave birth to a cult\\, and these fans are the one driving the force (pun intended). But when you alienate this group of people\\, you will only sought to affect the sales and brand of Star Wars. \\n\\nIt's so unfortunate that Disney turned Stars Wars: The Last Jedi into a mess\\, such a waste on the original trilogy actors. Thankfully Marvel is still doing a pretty decent job under Disney.","true":true}
