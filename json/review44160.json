Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To help combat the slew of stupidity from nacissitic SW \\\"fans\\\" - I must say this movie is all around brilliant. Cinematogrophy is overflowing with beauty\\, directed in a elegant form\\, edited to max cathartic pay-off\\, all technicalties of TLJ are perfect. \\n\\nSpoilers\\n\\nThe story and plot is a great base line that allows major storylines of character development to take place. Stop complaining about the fuel logic\\, you shouldnt think it over that much...\\n\\nTaking down the jedi and sith was perfect.\\n\\nLet go of the past... kill it.\\n\\nRian Johnson a genius.","true":true}
