Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game wasnt perfect but it was not far off from the feel of the first one. The game play especially was that same feel with a little more challenge to it. The sections do get repetitive and predictable by the time your a good 10 hours in but it's still fun.Peoples main complaints seem to come from an attachment to the death of Joel\\, which definitely made me angry at first\\, but I assume that was the whole point. Maybe they could have done a better job of making Abby likable but truly by the end of her 10 hours I was invested and the clash with Ellie really made me upset that my two characters were now fighting. People seems to also not understand the Ellie story at all\\, she was a kid that grew up deeply troubled by what Joel did for her and she is wracked with guilt for even being alive. Her getting revenge was her way of making Joel's mistake mean something to herself on top of just being plain revenge. The fact that she couldn't do it at the end was a final release (we hope) of that guilt she carried around for years. And that is exemplified by the final flashback where she was finally ready to start trying to forgive Joel for what he did. If people cant see the catharsis there and not understand why she did what she did its not bad writing\\, it's bad understanding of human emotions and behaviors. Everything she did made sense\\, minus some plots hole the story was relatively tight.The guilt from killing each member did not make much sense however and even if I can justify the pregnant one and the one she tortured I still feel like this part of the story was weakest and made the least amount of sense\\, shes killed so many people before why freak out now?Anyways this game did not deserve the user score it received and is a beautiful sequel to a wonderful franchise. If they do another one after it I truly would hope they focus souly on Ellie though as the Abby character doesn't leave a lasting impression and at this point I only want to see Ellies fall from grace or her rise to the top\\, we have seen her grow up and her traumatized time for an end game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
