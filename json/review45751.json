Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very good Starwars movie. Better than Ep VII\\, which I felt in some parts like a reboot. \\nThis new episode\\, The Last Jedi\\, has it all: tons of very well made special effects\\, a lot of action sequences\\, even humor. And\\, of course some incredible twists in the story that surprise the audience.\\n\\nEp VII develops more of Kilo Ren's internal conflict\\, and shows how he continues his journey through the dark side.\\n\\nJust a very few disappointments\\, like Captain Phasma\\, which in my view is a character \\\"underused\\\".\\n\\nOverall\\, great movie. One of my favorites among the entire saga.","true":true}
