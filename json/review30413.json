Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously boring. And how does Rei\\, who just started training match the fighting skills of Kylo Ren? It makes zero sense. I also thought the running through a casino on oversized horse-elephants was clumsy. Kind of anti capitolism in the most shallow way possible. They also seem to want to make sure they represent all diverse groups\\, and so have too many heroes for us to follow\\, and we end up caring about none of them. The only interesting character was Snoke\\, and he got killed.","true":true}
