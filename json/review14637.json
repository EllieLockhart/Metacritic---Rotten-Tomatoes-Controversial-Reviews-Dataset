Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have heard people are not liking The Last Jedi. I'm fine if you dont but after seeing it i think it refreshed my mind of what a Sar Wars film is. Its got a lot of action and yes\\, there may be a few places where I dont like but its not our movie. I really enjoyed it.","true":true}
