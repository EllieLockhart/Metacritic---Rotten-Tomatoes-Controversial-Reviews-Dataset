Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not understand the hate for this movie from so called \\\"die hard\\\" Star Wars fans.  A lot of complaints seem to center how much this doesn't feel like the original movies\\, which is ironic since the biggest complaint of the Force Awakens was that it was too much like a New Hope.  I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I absolutely loved the risks taken here.  Was it the best written or vest filmed movie I've ever seen?  No\\, but let's be honest neither are any of the other Star Wars movies.  This movie takes the franchise in a new direction.  I disagree with a lot of the complaints of the movie.  I thought they really fleshed out Kylo Rens character and made him a deeper more complex character\\, I actually really like what they did with Luke and his views on the Jedi(let's be honest he isn't wrong)\\, and I actually thought *spoiler* his death was well done(he sacrificed himself to buy time for the other to escape and they also mentioned earlier in the film how what he did would most likely kill him).  Also this movie has the coolest and by far the most mature and complex view of the Force and is by far my favorite addition to the Star Wars universe.  So ignore the hate from the so called \\\"die hard\\\" fans and go see this movie\\, even if you aren't a Star Wars fan it will still entertain you","true":true}
