Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars movie after Star Wars movie... everyone is expecting something more than a popcorn flick.  None of the other SW movies were works of art... I don't understand why people think that any new SW movie needs to be a work of art.  All the theories\\, ideas... shot down.  Kudos to Disney for pulling off a movie that no one was able to guess.     Loved the movie.   Lots of unexpectedness - lots of laughs - lots of action - lots of changes in characters over the years.  Physically - mentally - Luke was right in the trailer with his 'This will not end up the way you expected' quote.  Lucasfilm delivered and I was highly entertained... Twice this weekend.   The Star Wars magic is still there... if you let it in.    Seems like many people think the original 3... or even 6 were brilliant.  None of them were.  This one is more of the same... now with more humor and changes of attitude by some characters.   Can't wait to see where else the Star Wars universe takes us.  Be willing to accept change and you will enjoy the movie.  Sit back and expect more of what you have been given in the past - and you will not enjoy it.","true":true}
