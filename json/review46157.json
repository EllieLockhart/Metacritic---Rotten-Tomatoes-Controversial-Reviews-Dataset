Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Wahhh it didn't go the way I wanted and a girl was the star\\\"-All the 1 star reviews.\\nThis movie was brilliantly directed.  Most of the issues people have are because they built up all these theories in their head for no reason\\, then the movie didn't line up.  \\nIf you want a male-centered star wars\\, and that is your priority\\, that exists.\\nIf you want a nostalgic star wars\\, that exists.\\nIf you want predictable star wars\\, that exists.\\nIf you want boring backstory star wars\\, that exists.\\nIf you want something new\\, entertaining\\, and intelligent\\, this is the star wars movie for you.\\n\\nThis movie was awesome\\, the only issue was a couple plot points left hanging\\, but this is the 2nd movie of a sequel...so what do you expect?\\n\\nGo see it.","true":true}
