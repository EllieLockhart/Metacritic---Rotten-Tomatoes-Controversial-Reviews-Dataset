Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"really awesome movie. liked it even better than episode VII. was debating between 3.5 and 4.0. Decided on 4.0 because of how well made this movie is. the action in this movie is fantastic. the cinematography is amazing\\, visually stunning with so many mesmerizing shots. the story was great\\, and i loved all the directions they took this movie in. i don't really have any issues with this movie at all. great characters\\, great acting. well done (1 viewing)","true":true}
