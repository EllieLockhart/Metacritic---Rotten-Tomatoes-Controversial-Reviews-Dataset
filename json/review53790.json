Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals\\, a good cast\\, but an abysmal story that isn't true to the original films nor its immediate predecessor\\, The Force Awakens. As a stand alone film\\, it's entertaining\\, albeit confusing at times. When considered alongside the rest of the Star Wars franchise\\, it's just a sad attempt at a reboot (and one geared primarily toward a new generation of fans who don't know or care enough to notice how the story is being mishandled). Heroes and villains alike\\, both the new and the old\\, are made out to be pitiful and incapable or just tossed aside with little regard. The scale of the conflict appears so trivial despite the urgency portrayed in the opening spiel and the dialogue. It doesn't convey a galactic conflict of epic proportions. New characters are introduced\\, too\\, but none of them good or appropriate replacements for the ones who are lost or casually discarded. Entire sequences of the movie (Casino) seem so pointless to the story at hand and can hardly even be called side adventures. Some scenes are little more than reenactments of similar sequences from Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back\\, only with new characters and slightly different scenery. I love Star Wars\\, so I'll keep going to see the films for as long as they make them\\, but I do hope they learn from all this and get it right next time. I've got little hope for the next film\\, but perhaps the next trilogy or the television series? We'll see.","true":true}
