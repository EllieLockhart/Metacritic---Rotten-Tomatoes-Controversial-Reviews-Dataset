Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a beginning\\, a middle\\, and an end\\, but NONE of them are related to each other. Side characters have more of a role then protagonists\\, the script writing is god awful and that\u2019s putting it mildly... I honestly can\u2019t believe this was ever approved.","true":true}
