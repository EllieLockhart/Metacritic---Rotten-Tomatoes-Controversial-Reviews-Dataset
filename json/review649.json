QTE and choices aside I felt helpless\\, knowing that these people's lives are in your hands and there's no re-spawning made me stop and really think about what I was going to do. I paused the game on multiple occasions so I could weigh the options placed before me.\rI set out trying my hardest to ensure the friends survived even the ones I didn't like (Emily). Knowing that something as simple as using an item at the wrong time or not completing a QTE fast enough made there chances of survival lower or in some instances non existent was really tough on me.\rIn the end I loved Until Dawn\\, the butterfly effect had real ramifications\\, the characters had depth (even though they were based off 80s campy tropes)\\, the voice acting was top notch and the story was engaging. However\\, that had left turn 3\/4 of the way through was very jarring and that's really what caused me to give this game on 8.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
