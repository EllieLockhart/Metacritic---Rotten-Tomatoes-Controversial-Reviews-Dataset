Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst star wars movie I've ever seen. not my Star Wars\\, NOT my Luke Skywalker! Rian Johnson find some respect for the fans and show it.... If you are a Star Wars lover\\, don't watch this movie and you'll be ok\\, I Hope!! may the force be with you. BTW\\, the force has no gender.","true":true}
