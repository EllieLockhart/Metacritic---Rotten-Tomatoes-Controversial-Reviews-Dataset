Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without deconstructing TLJ  fully like others have\\, at first viewing I did enjoy the film overall.  That is a very high level view of course as I plan to see it once or twice more to obtain a better idea of the story and important items I might have missed.  But\\, I am comparing TLJ to the previous film\\, TFA in this instance.  I thought TFA began beautifully but the second half of the film derailed tremendously. (Another Death Star\\, really?  And it can be easily destroyed...again?) I did not get the same feeling from TLJ.  I tend to bring out the magnifying glass like many and over analyze the Star Wars universe\\, comparing the recent films to the original and so on.  As there were certainly plot and continuity issues in this film described ad-nauseam by many others\\, one can return to the original movies and do the same nit-picking.  At the moment\\, I'm looking at this film from a holistic viewpoint\\, asking questions like\\, Was the film well made?  Did I enjoy the film?  I can get past the Mary Poppins Leia and Space Gravity for now and answer\\, Yes.  Maybe after the 3rd viewing I'll be in a different place with my magnifying glass.","true":true}
