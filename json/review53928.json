{"101487":128931,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge\\, sparkly\\, fun\\, and utterly disappointing\\, even insulting. There are some fun new characters and places\\, and dazzling visuals but as the time\\, and the barely there plot\\, drags out more than one of the film's many inadequacies pulls you out of the engagement and yawns turn to disdain if you have any respect for the Star Wars saga until now. \\n\\nFor sure\\, I enjoyed myself for most of the movie\\, and the production is quite good\\, but the story\\, oh the story\\, it sags at best. If this were not a Star Wars movie\\, or if this were like episode 11 or 15 or a spinoff\\, we would be talking about incoherence within it's own plot\\, flat acting\\, and long inconsequential story development filled with haughty hubris filled story-writing that goes nowhere. But\\, if this were not a Star Wars movie\\, we'd be saying this a fun\\, well-produced\\, and overall decent action flick. However\\, since it IS Episode VIII we judge it primarily on the merit of advancing the story of the seven episodes before it and balancing the legacy of countless books\\, games\\, and stories before in preparation for much more in the future. In this\\, The Last Jedi completely fails. It is clear too\\, that it was no accident.\\n\\nThis is no Star Wars story\\, this is a baldfaced attempt to retcon numerous core elements of the Star Wars saga before it\\, including the events of Episode VII\\, the original trilogy\\, Luke Skywalker's legacy and even his personality\\, the force\\, and much more. That makes Rian Johnson a rogue director that somehow got through (evaded?) the quality control at Lucasfilm and disrespected in no uncertain terms the franchise and all the fans who have brought him the opportunity to write and direct this. It is a disgrace\\, and a tragedy\\, and I for one hope that this entire film is no only walked back\\, retconned\\, and remade\\, I hope Rian Johnson never touches another Star Wars film or any franchise that he himself didn't make.\\n\\nThis should have been such a key movie - midway through the final trilogy of the Skywalker Saga - bringing the whole ship in for a landing and glorious send away opening the door for scores of new heroes and new stories. If Disney and Lucasfilm just did that\\, heck they didn't even have to do it well as long as they did it respectfully\\, fans would happily follow directors into any new territory that they want to take us. Alas\\, they botched the most important segue into the future of the franchise in their handling of Luke\\, the Jedi\\, and nearly every fan loved aspect of Star Wars with this movie that Star Wars may not recover without serious intervention. I for one will not be paying to see any more Star Wars films (or merchandise) unless this changes drastically.   -Sad\\, Sad Star Wars Fan","true":true}
