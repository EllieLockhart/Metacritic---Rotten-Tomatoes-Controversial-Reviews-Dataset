Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Cinematography. Not a star wars movie. Force awakens poorly ties to last jedi and most of the things don't make sense.\\n\\n1) Lea was thrown into space\\, manages to survive and starts using force? Really i don't think the concept of force was fully grasped\\n\\n2) Whats the point of SNOKE if he was killed easily and how come he didn't sense both of their minds?\\n\\n3) Kylo goes from a little child that got beaten by Ray to a big deal that becomes a supreme leader?\\n\\n4)  Luke\\, a master Jedi depressed? Are you kidding me? It doesn't tie to the character that we know as Luke Skywalker. Depression and misery leads to the dark side\\, Master Jedi hide but they never lock themselves from the force.\\n\\n5) What happened to Force Ghost of Obi wan and anakin skywalker? How come they didn't reveal themselves?\\n\\n6) Chewbaca and Ray? Really ? Chewbaca only works with Han Solo and not anyone else.  \\n\\nThis is just a milking business now. Thanks Disney for running the movie","true":true}
