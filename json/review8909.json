Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Freaking loved it. Honestly I've seen all the major scifi and fantasy movies all year - and this is the best. It completely transcended what I expected. \\nI'm not surprised some of the \\\"fans\\\" hated it (I'm 27 year old and have been a Star Wars fan for 27 years.) It was different. You saw your hero fall in every sense of the way. But anyone who thinks about what happens below the surface will see that this was 1) exactly where they were going after VII 2) VERY MUCH expected after VII - if you've read the book 3) actually perfect as a continuation of Star Wars\\, Darth Vader's story. \\nI can't wait for the next one. I'd better not die in the next two year or I'll have to linger as a ghost just to find out what happened. Seriously. Freaking perfect. Watched it three times and I'll be back a fourth time on Saturday.","true":true}
