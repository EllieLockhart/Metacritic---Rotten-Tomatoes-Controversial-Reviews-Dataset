Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a complete trash movie filled with plotholes and bad writing. rules are broken to advance the story and honestly... just go watch the original 3 and call it a day. this movie is complete cancer.","true":true}
