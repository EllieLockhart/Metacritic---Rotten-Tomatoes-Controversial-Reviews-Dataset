Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. None of the characters grow. Finn is given nothing to do\\,Luke is incredibly mishandled. Tons of plot holes and it seems like Rian Johnson didn't even watch the force awakens. Poorly written movie and makes me not even want to care what happens to these characters in the next sequel.","true":true}
