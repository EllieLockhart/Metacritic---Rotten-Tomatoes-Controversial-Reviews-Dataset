Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent entertainment that has the additional benifit of a deeper meaning. Every time Hamill is on screen is especially riveting. I can't imagine how next installment will be made without Princess Leia. Props to Laura Dern\\, too. Definitely will see again very soon. ","true":true}
