Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cash grab garbage and yet another reason why the movie industry is going down the tubes with recycled music and an uneven plot and characters that don't fit in\\, now if you want the real Episodes 7\\, 8\\, & 9 you won't get them because Disney threw those scripts away. Don't see it you'll waist 2 and a half hours of your life that you can't get back.","true":true}
