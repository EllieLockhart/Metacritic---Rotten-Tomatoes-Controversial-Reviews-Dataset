Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get the criticism for this film and I have a problem with its over use of comedy which diluted a number of its dramatic scenes. There were also some sequences which didn't work or felt unnecessary. However there was more about this that I likes than didn't especially the dynamic between Ray and Kilo. How this film sits I the trilogy we'll have to see with episode nine but7 it will be interesting with things which seemed to be setup in the Force Awakens just brushed aside.","true":true}
