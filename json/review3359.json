Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Besides Finn and Rose this movie is really good. Every sense I liked was great\\, every sense I didn\u2019t like was really boring or it didn\u2019t feel like Star Wars\\, for example the Finn and Rose sense reminded me of Harry Potter. The action is tense\\, the cinematography is great and the acting is really good\\, especially Adam Driver. The only problem with the movie is that it\u2019s to long. I feel that if the Finn and Rose stuff was cut and they changed the sense completely\\, it would be the best movie of the year. In all those are my opinions","true":true}
