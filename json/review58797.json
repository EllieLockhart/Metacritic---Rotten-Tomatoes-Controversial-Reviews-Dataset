Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Where do I begin with this game. This has to be the most disappointing and frustrating game i've ever played. I remember watching Pewds play the 1st one because I couldn't afford a ps3 back in the day.I experienced the game for myself a month before last of us 2 came out and it became my third favorite game of all time. Experiencing the characters and they're development\\, the music\\, the gameplay and more for myself really got me hyped for the sequel. Then i played last of us 2\\, what a trainwreck. Ellie is a mindless killer who doesn't care about anyone but herself. She treats Joel like **** the whole game and Joel gets killed just for shock value. Then we have to play as her killer for half the goddamn game when I WANTED nothing more than to see her DIE. Little to no innovation in the game\\, A.i are retarded for the most part until they see you and your a.i companions are garbage. They're 10 times worse than in the first one. Then during the flashback when joel tells ellie what really happened he doesn't explain himself well AT ALL. They make Joel look like the bad guy through the whole game and make him and Tommy retarded\\, leading to Joel's death. Then the ending was the worst thing i've ever seen after all the people ellie killed\\, after killing joel her father figure what does she do to the one person who did 99% of the killing. SHE LETS HER GO\\, LIKE WHAT!?!? Ellie is left broken and she cant play guitar anymore\\, Tommy is crippled and divorced\\, and Joel is dead making Sarah's death meaningless. And the one who killed the main character of the first game gets EVERYTHING SHE WANTS revenge and a friend to continue to survive with. But revenge is bad for ellie but good for abby. what a ****ty story. Please don't waste your money on this piece of **** The graphics\\, the flashbacks with joel and ellie\\, and the music literally save this game from being a 0!!!! The worst ps exclusive of the generation and easily the most disappointing. i don't want to make this longer than it already is but these were the main points i wanted to hit.Graphics: 9\/10Story:0\/10Gameplay:0\/10Music:9\/10Character development:0\/10DON'T BUY THIS TRASH\u2026 Expand","true":true}
