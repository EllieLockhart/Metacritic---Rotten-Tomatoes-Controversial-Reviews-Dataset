Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi; can be described as an action packed rollercoaster ride that has its highs and lows. The movie failed to present a fluid storyline expressed by drawn out subplots and massive action scenes that seemed in over abundence. Although the saga has presented us with an expansion of new characters in The Force Awakens (2015). Characters haven't seen any progresstion but just minor scenes that miss their mark. The movie does a great job bringing back some nostalgic scenes that remind us of the rich and charished past and you want just want to jump right in. All in all\\, Star Wars The Last Jedi did a great job bringing us nostalgic but new ideas to the saga but missed it's opportunity to bring a fluid story and character progresstion. Even though this movie is not perfect it moves the storyline and brings forth the next installment into our beloved story. ","true":true}
