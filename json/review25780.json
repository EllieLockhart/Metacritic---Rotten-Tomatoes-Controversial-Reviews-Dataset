Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not authentic Star Wars. No character development. Very plastic feeling. And\\, I really like Rey but one yoga session with a Jedi a Jedi does not make you (i.e.\\, how does she do what she does without any training).  Also\\, needed to be a half hour shorter.","true":true}
