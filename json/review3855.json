Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"bizarre CONCOCTION OF STAR WARS + MARVEL MOVIES + SYFY CHANNEL MOVIES AND what-not\\, BUT NOTHING CLOSE TO WHAT STAR WARS - THE LAST JEDI (SUCH A GRAND TITLE) SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  THIS movie IS MADE FOR FANS OF DORY\\, NEMO\\, lightning mcqueen and tow mater.  no serious star wars fan should tolerate this insult to intellect.  i'm rating it 1.5 stars just because the director made luke skywalker happy by having him drink that green milk squirting out of the mammary glands of the lounging dinosaur.","true":true}
