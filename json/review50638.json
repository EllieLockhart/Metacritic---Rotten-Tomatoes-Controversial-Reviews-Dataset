Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4 out of 10. Preferred the prequels - never seen a film cop out as much as this one. It changes all the established rules as the writers were unable to write anything compelling enough to get around it.","true":true}
