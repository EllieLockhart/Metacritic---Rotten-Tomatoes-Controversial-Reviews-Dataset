Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it. While I was not completely happy with the direction of the old characters (I selfishly want them to live forever and have more movies made about them)\\, I think it's what was needed for the story to continue on to the next generation. Luke needed redemption and his last scene was beautiful and poetic. Thank you for honoring the essence of Star Wars. Also\\, THANK YOU for including women. It was incredibly refreshing to see women in major command roles\\, as well as in the command centers doing the regular tasks of tracking and communications within the rebellion and the first order. Can't wait to see it again!","true":true}
