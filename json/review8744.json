Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a movie with so much crying\\, there was so little real emotion. I didn't mind number 7\\, but number 8 has truely ruined star wars. The characters are so weak\\, the story line is weaker.","true":true}
