Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With The Force Awakens Star Wars was back! The Magic was back! Then Rogue One hit and I loved it as much...maybe more.... now with The Last Jedi.... The Force is back asleep and dreaming of campy\\, slapstick jokes.","true":true}
