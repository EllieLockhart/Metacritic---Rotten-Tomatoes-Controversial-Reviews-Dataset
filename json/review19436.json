Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its still not answering the question who is actually Rey parents and why Kylo and Rey can communicate each other through the space although Snoke make connection between them. There must be something that make Snoke trigger the connection right? Who Snoke also not been reveal. But seems there will be another Star Wars movie in 2019 hopefully we will get the answer. And furthermore\\, I think there no need so much scene between Finn and Rose just a waste of time unless there is something that might reveal in the next instalment?? The CGI performance and Fighting scene are not dissapointed but overall the storyline seems still cliffhanger this is my rating for the movie.","true":true}
