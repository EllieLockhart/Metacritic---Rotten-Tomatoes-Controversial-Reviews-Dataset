Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard Star Wars fan\\, since 1980\\, I understand the vitriol expressed by many\\, about this installment\\, after seeing it the first time. I had the opportunity to watch it again with my fellow workmates. I made it a point to keep an open mind (not being biased about my hopes for Luke Skywalker\\, or other criticism about force walking in space\\, or Snoke\\, and the direction taken). Having said all this\\, I have to admit\\, the CRITICS are right here! This is indeed a Star Wars\\, not just for everyone\\, but for THIS generation. If you look closely at the plot\\, it is not as simplistic as some viewers are mentioning. The conflict that Luke suffers thru\\, is really an evolution of a human being; similar to how much idealism we have\\, while in college\\, but then let 20 plus years pass you by\\, and you start looking at the world a bit more critical. This movie is absolutely brilliant\\, and die-hards\\, I am like you\\, but we can\u2019t adopt the position of \u2018stay off my lawn\\,\u2019 as once that has come to pass\\, we will find ourselves suffering the same fate as \u2018old Snoke.\u2019 In closing I will quote Commissioner Gordon: \u201cHe's the hero Gotham deserves\\, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it.\u201d This is the Star Wars that we currently deserve! Enjoy My Friends!","true":true}
