Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some cool visuals and good fight scenes can't\\nBalance out the forced humor\\, bloated run time and plot holes which the audience is being told to overlook. For all the talk of a \\\"bold new direction\\\" we're still dealing with a Sith Lord leading an Empire against a young Jedi lesding a band of rebel forces. The film had an opportunity to go a different route but stuck with the same conflict we've seen in just about every SW movie. \\n\\nAnd on a personal note\\, stop telling movie going audiences what they should like or demonizing them for not enjoying a movie as the critics did.","true":true}
