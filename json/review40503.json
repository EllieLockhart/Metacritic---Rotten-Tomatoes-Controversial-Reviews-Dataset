Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is the movie that killed the star wars movies the movie is so bad if you like star wars don't watch this movie it will destroy the franchise for you every thing about this movie is bad the main character is a mary sue the plot is one of the worst ive ever seen characters ruin parts that could have made the movie good and interesting parts that could have mad the plot interesting added personality to the characters but everytime the movie had a chance they would never follow through they pull things from their ass and act like its canon this movie put star wars is on life support and the next movie will probably be the bullet that puts star wars in the grave","true":true}
