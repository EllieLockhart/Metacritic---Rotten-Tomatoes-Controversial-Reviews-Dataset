Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aesthetically flawless\\, jaw-dropping most of the times\\, funny for sure but some gags and dialogues feel like they don't belong\\, almost parody material at times. Interesting choices and twists are there\\, but the movie doesn't have the balls to actually fully commit to them most of the times and so we end up with a narrative that doesn't really go anywhere\\, and almost the same can be said about the characters\\, speaking of which we get new ones that are completely undeveloped even when they could be interesting\\, and returning ones that suffer from this overabundance (Phasma\\, Snoke). Sad to say\\, good ideas poorly executed\\, good characters poorly developed\\, good comedic timing poorly thought out and shoved into the dramatic tension inappropriately very often.\\n\\nDisappointing considering the great ideas and potential that the movie shows\\, and the visual spectacle that undoubtedly offers\\, but still enjoyable of course. One can only hope that Episode IX will retroactively fix some of the issues and make the trilogy experience more coherent.","true":true}
