Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see why Mark Hamill disagreed with where Johnson was taking Luke Skywalker. He had every right to because it sucked. Completely went against the character and ignored all of Star Wars lore. Acting is great but the story is awful and what they did to Skywalker is dreadful. All this makes a terrible film. Worst Star Wars movie in the franchise.","true":true}
