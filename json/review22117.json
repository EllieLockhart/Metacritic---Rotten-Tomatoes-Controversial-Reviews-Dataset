Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killed the franchise\\, divided the fan base\\, and killed my childhood hero Luke Skywalker and turned him into a character I couldn't recognize. Terrible story writing\\, just look at the reviews!!! 44% rotten\\, it's the worst rated Star Wars movie ever and that's a fact.  THIS is the movie that ruined Star Wars for a lot of fans including myself. If you think this is a decent movie then you've obviously never seen the original trilogy. Thanks Disney...","true":true}
