Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a big dumb movie that begs you not to think too much about the forced plot and just enjoy the spectacle.\\n\\nThere's brief glimpses of brilliance\\, but it's bogged down in a sea of mediocrity. Whenever there's a serious moment\\, it's undercut with something goofy. The entire film feels like a big joke. They really dropped the ball with Luke's new character. If you are a fan of the original trilogy\\, you might be shaking your head by the end due to some of the decisions made.\\n\\nThe film does look pretty. Will probably look great in 4k.","true":true}
