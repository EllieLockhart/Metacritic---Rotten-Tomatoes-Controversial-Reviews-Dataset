Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't wait to see this\\, but I wasn't expecting much. This is the worst movie I have seen in a LONG time. I won't even get into the why\\, because it is so blaringly obvious. I did see an article in the Washington Post speculating that men's rights activists are against this movie... I have two wonderful daughters and love to see more female leads. I loved Rogue One.\\n\\n I am very disappointed that any self respecting movie critic could rate it a 92%? Really\\, RT? I have always preached how great RT is and that they have accurate ratings. I was wrong\\, they can be bought.","true":true}
