Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible mess that ruins the entire franchise. I didn't think it was possible for one movie to completely destroy all the movies that came before it\\, but this one proved it's possible. A complete and utter disappointment too wrapped up in politics and completely useless plot points. I refuse to see another new Star Wars movie if it's made by Disney\\, and I'll pretend that the new trilogy doesn't exist. I refuse to let it ruin everything that was once great about this galaxy.","true":true}
