Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though it has a few flaws here and there\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is still visually stunning\\, simply built\\, intense and nerve-wrecking most of the time\\, resulting in it ending up being one of the best movies in the legendary saga\\, once again featuring new and classic characters.","true":true}
