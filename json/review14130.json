Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you walk into this movie with a mindset of what you think it should be you will most likely be disappointed. If you walk in wanting to see a Star Wars movie you will enjoy it. Disney bought it\\, it's a bit campy now at parts but that's something we have to deal with. All in all\\, entertaining and fun.","true":true}
