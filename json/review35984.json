Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi on its own is a decent film\\, though with some pacing flaws. But my overall problems with the film\\, comes from thinking of the film as the second film in a trilogy that is supposed to make sense. I mean\\, it feels like Ryan Johnson just gave a massive \\\"middle finger\\\" to J.J. Abrams \\\"the Force Awakens\\\" and throws all his ideas out the window. We as an audience are now left alone and confused\\, not knowing who to root for\\, and who to root against. So all in all\\, this is a good movie\\, with great cinematography\\, that fails big time as the 2nd movie in a trilogy. Sad.","true":true}
