Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In defense of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" (warning... contains MASSIVE spoilers!)\\n\\nI've read some passionate attacks on the The Last Jedi.  So far all the ones I've seen have been pretty shallow and largely missed the point.  Here are my responses...\\n\\nComplaint: the dialog is terrible and jokes are cheesy\\nResponse: you came to a Star Wars movie looking for good dialog and non-cheesy jokes?  What were you thinking?\\n\\nComplaint: Luke's character is ruined by his curmudgeonly behavior.\\nResponse: When has Luke not been lame?  And based on the story-line from TFA\\, what did you expect him to do?  \\n\\nComplaint: Luke milks a space walrus.  \\nResponse: So what.  Grow up.  'The myriad forms of fauna and flora in the universe' is an important sub-theme in the series and in this movie in particular.  I'll bet public breast-feeding bothers you too.\\n\\nComplaint: Prince Leia survives the vacuum and makes herself fly through space like Mary Poppins.\\nResponse: hey\\, if you've already accepted the premise that telekinesis\\, mind-reading\\, shooting purple lightning from fingertips etc. are possible\\, is it really a stretch that she can use The Force to hold her eyeballs in\\, resist cold and pull herself back into the ship? \\n\\nComplaint: Kylo Ren is so emo.  His temper tantrums were already getting old in TFA.  \\nResponse: Um\\, the whole thing about the Sith is that you are supposed to go with your emotions.  So being \\\"emo\\\" is kinda the point\\, no?  Just admit you don't like his big pouty lips.  \\n\\nComplaint: space bombers\\nResponse: got me on this one.  It's ridiculous.  Only thing I can say is that in a 150 minute movie\\, this bit represents a tiny fraction.\\n\\nComplaint: nothing happens the way it's supposed to!  \\nThey kill the main villain in the 2nd installment\\, without even a fight! \\nThe casino sequence leads nowhere!  \\nThe bad-boy rebellious Poe turns out to be totally wrong\\, and the tight-laced authority type with bad purple hair is not only right\\, but saves everybody!  \\nThe code-breaker doesn't actually have a heart of gold!  \\nRose saves Finn\\, preventing him from stopping the \\\"miniaturized Death Star tech\\\" sequence from reaching its \\\"inevitable\\\" conclusion (\\\"Independence Day\\\" FTW)!\\nRen doesn't kill Luke\\, and doesn't end up turning good!\\nWorst of all\\, Rey doesn't even have a special bloodline! \\n\\nResponse: If all of this stuff bothers you\\, you should just go back and repeat-watch episodes IV and V (even VI probably wasn't pure enough for you) until the end of time.  And talk about how\\, generally speaking\\, everything is going to Hell in a hand-basket.  Nothing new will satisfy you\\, again\\, ever.  It is BECAUSE of these contrary-to-expectation turns of events that the movie was so bitchin.  Do you really need your every little Star Wars nostalgia itch to be scratched again and again? In that case\\, what's the point of making NEW movies?","true":true}
