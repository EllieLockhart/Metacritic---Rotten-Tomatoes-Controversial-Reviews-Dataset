Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word describes this film... GARBAGE. One would think that after paying $40 for a 3D IMAX film that you would basically sit through anything no matter how bad... Wrong. I have never in my life walked out of a movie before the end\\, guess there is a first time for everything. Within the first hour it is clear that Hollywood is trying to shove their political agenda down your throat with their solely powerful women and trigger happy\\, idiotic men (why can't both be represented on either side?!). \\nThe movie started to go downhill when Poe seemingly has a character change at the beginning with is absolute NEED to \\\"blow something up\\\"\\, not a trait even nearing the Poe of The Force Awakens. Then you have space Leia\\, who has never once shown to have any Jedi traits fly through the vacuum of space and knock on the door to be let in... Really?? And the fun doesn't stop there... Then there is Holdon who screams SJW feminist\\, and clearly hates men. \\nI could go on and on. There were some cool scenes\\, but overall\\, not redeeming enough for the absolute rubbish. I mean this film was literally about a ship running out of fuel... Boring\\, political\\, and full of plot holes. Dont waste your time or money on this burning pile of trash. \\n\\nP.S. Was a huge fan of the recent films The Force Awakens and Roge One. This one just ccompletely missed the mark and left a bad political taste in my mouth.","true":true}
