Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember leaving the theater absolutely disgusted by this abomination. I have never been more insulted than that day. It's a giant f*** you to Star Wars fans that grew up with Luke Skywalker. Only it's wrapped in the prettiest paper ever so it doesn't seem that way. I'm sure Rian Johnson could make a great and original movie. But this is a sequel trilogy. The story has already been laid out for you...I get his idea of not giving audiences what they want. And critics loved it. Than you completely miss the point of Star Wars....","true":true}
