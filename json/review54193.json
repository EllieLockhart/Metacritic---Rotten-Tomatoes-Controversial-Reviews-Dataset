Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If 'The Force Awakens' was the worthy follow-up the franchise needed from where the Original Trilogy left off. Then 'The Last Jedi' is the most worthy follow-up\/direct continuation this new trilogy needed. Writer\/Director; Rian Johnson\\, has crafted an incredibly intense and cathartic Space Opera epic\\, even if this being the longest Star Wars film ever made than don't be alarmed by the pacing as Johnson has kept everything in tact. It's clear\\, this franchise isn't just about large scale space battles\\, lasers\\, light and dark\\, but really; an intelligent blockbuster with high stakes drama brought up to an all new higher level able to carry the weight and drama of it's characters from the very beginning to the very end. Even while the film tends to focus so much on varying plot threads\\, it is most certainly worth every minute as this film takes so many bold moves within the encompassing nature of it's plot\\, it's heart-pounding to not get caught up in the moments of extreme intensity\\, either scary or deeply moving. Even from the outset\\, I'm going to say that what's being said is either being taken too seriously from not getting what one wants or speculates or is just a misshapen upon case of not understanding it enough. Instead\\, see this film for what it is\\, how it's honors it's past legacies and has all the goods in both drama and large scale action. Further\\, it's insane to think what more could I recommend to see this film on the big screen\\, not only will fans be satisfied with it's level of unpredictability\\, it sets up what's to come in concluding an old and new generations.","true":true}
