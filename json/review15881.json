Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the original trilogy so it\u2019s hard not to compare. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the force awakens because well let\u2019s face it\\, it was the exact same story as the originals. I was hoping that the last Jedi would have some originality but nope just a remake of empire strikes back with a lot of unnecessary humor thrown in. What has happened? Where is the creativity in the movie industry? Just so sad and disappointed. ","true":true}
