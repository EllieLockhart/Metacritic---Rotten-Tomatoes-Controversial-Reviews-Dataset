{"101487":175873,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen\\, but it was definitely the most disappointing. To keep this top half of the review spoiler free\\, I will just go over the basics. The movie had poor story development\\, a plot that was scattered and all over the place\\, tried WAY too hard on its comedic relief\\, and introduced boring new characters. The movie had a couple jaw-dropping scenes\\, but other than that\\, was drawn out and sporadic. \\n\\n**SPOILERS BELOW**\\n\\nThe details and story of this movie were absolutely horrendous\\, in my point of view. No answers for Snoke (or his past).  No clarity of Rey's heritage. No Knights of Ren (what the hell happened to this plot-line??). An utterly disappointing Luke story arc and ending. No \\\"true\\\" Luke fight scene. Cheesy Yoda and Yoda scene. Cheesy Leia scene (returning to the ship from space). Main antagonist (Snoke) dies before BARELY any screen-time\\, or fighting\\, or anything... The plot was all over the place. Useless\\, boring new characters... This movie had so much potential\\, but unfortunately\\, did not deliver.","true":true}
