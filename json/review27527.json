Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall It took bold choices. It cared more about thematic resolution and character development then plot consistency- however that is nothing new for the Star Wars franchise. Some people will be unhappy because of the focus on character and messages over plot and pacing\\, or think that some characters weren't the way they wanted them to be\\, but every character we see viscerally changes from the beginning to the end\\, and I thought the characterization was spot on. Still\\, the heavy focus on themes and characterization means that a second watch may be necessary for some in order to understand\\, which for this kind of movie is a flaw in itself\\, so I cannot give it a full five stars","true":true}
