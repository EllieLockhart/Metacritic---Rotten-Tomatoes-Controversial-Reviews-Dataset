Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let's break it down: The game takes about 3 hours ON AVERAGE to develop\/hype up characters nobody gave a rat's ass about\\, and then they do absolute **** Then\\, actually developed characters with huge amounts of future\/past potential\\, just...gone. Hers an example: Lev\\, whom Naughty Dog spent 6+ hours to develop with\\, her ONLY interaction with the relevant plot of \\\"revenge\\\" was calling out \\\"Abby\\\". This is not a joke. Any side character or even extra cutscene displaying Abby having morals could have easily achieved the same effect. That religious cult? that you excepted great things from? Nah they did absolutely nothing to the revenge plot. That entire development could've been Abby taking a dump in the toilet and nothing would change. And as if the story isn't bad enough\\, Repetitive puzzles and draining lootings\\, unnecessarily enormous environments with very little that worths exploring\\, and Metacritic now deletes negative reviews (from 5015 to 3621 as of this very moment)\\, has just lost all the respect built from TLOU 1. Great job Neil\\, you lost a fan.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
