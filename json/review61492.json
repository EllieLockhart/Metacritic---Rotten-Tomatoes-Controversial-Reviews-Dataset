This game took me on a roller coaster  of emotions\\, I felt happy\\, sad\\, angry\\, shocked and at certain points numb in a complete state of disbelief. I love complex characters and the main characters choices in this story can seem wrong or not what you would expect. Once I finished it I sat back and went over their points of view I came to the conclusion that what I thought I wanted out of this sequels story wasn\u2019t what I got but it did everything a good story does and that doesn\u2019t make it a bad one!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
