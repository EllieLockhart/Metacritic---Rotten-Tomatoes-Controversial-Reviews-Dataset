Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson killed Star Wars as we know it. Purposely? Very likely: 1) to satisfy his egotistical view of the franchise and its universe; 2) to allow Episode IX be the final reboot of SW and let pass the next new trilogy \\\"a la Rian\\\". This is the perfect example in movie cinema when a film is not better than the sum of its parts. If you see this movie\\, you will no longer care in the future for what you loved and longed during the past 40 years. How to solve it? Instead of delivering Episode IX\\, bring Episode 8.1\\, where it all turned out to be Luke's dream. What would of happen if he loses it\\, and now that he knows better\\, what could he do to do things rights. And then deliver us Episode IX!!!!","true":true}
