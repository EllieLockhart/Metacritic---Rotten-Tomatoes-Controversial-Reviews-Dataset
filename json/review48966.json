Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever. The plot is horrible\\, the characters are annoying\\, the pacing is way off\\, and there was no pay off in the end. I\u2019ll never see this movie again or any future Star Wars Film. It\u2019s almost like the director was trying to make a horrible film. ","true":true}
