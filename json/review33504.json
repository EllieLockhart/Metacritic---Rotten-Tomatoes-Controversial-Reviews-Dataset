Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible directing\\, and an even worse job of story writing. Easily the worst film of the franchise. It does a powerful and effective job of destroying the previous movies and their characters. I could say more\\, but others have covered it already. This movie wasted your time. I will not.","true":true}
