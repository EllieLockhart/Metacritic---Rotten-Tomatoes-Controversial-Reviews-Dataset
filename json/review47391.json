Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What could have been the jewel in the Star Wars crown has turned out to be a mess. What an amazing story could have been told. The return of Luke Skywalker....fantastic new characters growing in front of us....such potential. But no. Rian Johnson had other ideas. And unfortunately it doesn't work. \\nThe direction is bad. The story is bad. The character development is so poor and the performances not good. Except for Hamill. He's fantastic. Finn...Rey....even BB8! have all suffered at the hands of the director. He's tried to do something different here\\, but different doesn't always mean good. There's moments that make you smile\\, but far too few. For a movie that's two and a half hours long it doesn't build any tension or seem to go anywhere. We're left with new characters that I was warming too in the Force Awakens\\, but now I couldn't care less about. After the decent Force Awakens\\, excellent Rogue One\\, we've been given this. Such a disappointment.","true":true}
