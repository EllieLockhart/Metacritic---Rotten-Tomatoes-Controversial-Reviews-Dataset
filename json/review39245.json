Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film goes against existing lore and canon of the Star Wars saga whilst also contradicting itself all the way through its full of plot holes and drops while storyline just be be \\\"surprising\\\" for the sake of it rather than giving a good story it just blinds casual so called \\\"Star Wars fans\\\" with action sequences so that it can get good ratings whilst forcing its feminist and SJW agenda against us and just disrespects everything that came before it including the force awakens (which is just as bad as this movie) genuinely went into this movie open minded after the disappointment of the force awakens and I was onboard with the film for the first 20 minutes before they decided to ruin the franchise forever this isn't a Star Wars film this new trilogy should be considered DISNEY WARS","true":true}
