Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! It's awesome to see a break from the hum drum tempo in older movies. Plus the twist and plot development were on point. Tons of people were upset because they spent 2 years fantasizing about what they wanted to happen. You have to remember no one wants to see a movie where it's predictable and contrived. Personally\\, I wanted to see Luke come down from the heavens and destroy all the badies with the force. Overall\\, it was a great addition to the series that lays a solid framework for the future. Plus that cameo was awesome!","true":true}
