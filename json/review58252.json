Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bastardization of Star Wars\\, infused with misguided and generally incorrect political sentiments that are more a product of the times that we live in\\, than something that is characteristic of the general narrative scope of Star Wars: the continual struggle between good and evil\\, and the balance of light and dark.\\n\\nFurther\\, without spoiling anything\\, it utterly defiles the canon and derails the trilogy. It is all flash and no substance. Yet\\, the damage is done.","true":true}
