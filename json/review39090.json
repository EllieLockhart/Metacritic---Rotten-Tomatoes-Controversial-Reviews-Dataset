Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This broke my heart and has irrevocably soured something I have enjoyed and treasured since childhood.  It wasn't even just a horrible Star Wars movie\\, it was a horrible movie period.\\n\\nPlot holes big enough to fly an Imperial Star Destroyer through\\, inconsistent narrative\\, characters reduced to caricatures\\, forced humor\\, uneven pacing\\, unbelievable dialog\\, too many loose ends\\, and a complete butchery of the canon and lore of the Star Wars universe... I have not enough words to express the sadness and contempt I have for this travesty.\\n\\nIt has tainted the Star Wars franchise\\, story\\, and saga so badly\\, I am unable to even enjoy the original movies\\, the EU books\\, the old collectibles\\, multitudes of tabletop and video game... everything that brought me delight until now.\\n\\nThere was before seeing this movie\\, and there is after seeing this movie.  After seeing this movie there is no going back\\, and now Star Wars is dead to me. 40 years of love gone. #RIPStarWars","true":true}
