Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Changed my review from 1\/2 star to full star to make sure it counts.\\n\\nThis movie is bad. Like \\\"Indiana Jones \/ Crystal Skulls\\\" bad. \\nIt's so bad it pisses people off 6 months later. \\nLiterally squanders all the good will of TFA with yo momma jokes and being contrary for the sake of being contrary and has the balls to call itself brilliant. \\nHow can Infinity War come from the same company that green-lighted this stinking pile.","true":true}
