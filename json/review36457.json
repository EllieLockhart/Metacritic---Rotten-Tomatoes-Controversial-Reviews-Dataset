Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most Poorly written\\, directed and produced film in the Star Wars saga by far. The prequels felt more like Star Wars than the last Jedi did. During the film I was saying to myself this can't be right nothing feels like it should. I saw the force awakens twice in theaters and the last Jedi I won't even buy the blue ray it's that bad. No more of my money for you I say to the people who let this come to the big screen be smart Disney and hire a film student in college and you'll have a better Star Wars movie. P. S no more politics in movies unless it's a movie about politics please people hate seeing it in film.","true":true}
