Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first I was entertained. Walking out of the theater I remember that I had that pleasant feeling that I get when I consume eye candy.  Not much later\\, after parsing what I'd just seen\\, I became bitterly disappointed.  Ugh.  I won't waste time repeating what everyone else has said.  Disney Star Wars is no longer part of my personal cannon.  How could you Disney?  What a great tragedy to ruin such a fine story like this and squander such a great opportunity.  I will never watch another star wars film produced by you.\\n\\nTo all who haven't seen this film yet\\, recommend you follow the wise words of Ben Kenobi and his stormtrooper friend\\, \\\"Move along\\, move along\\\".\\n\\nP.S. I made an account on rottentomatoes just for this.","true":true}
