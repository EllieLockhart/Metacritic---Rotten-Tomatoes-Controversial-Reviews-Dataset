Before even playing I already hated this Abby character. Upon being able to play as her\\, to really witness and feel her story as we would with the other main character\\, I truly began to feel for her. Many people are so upset about the drama before the game was released\\,  some maybe even going as far as to not give this game a chance or even give it a poor review out of spite. I however am a true gamer and have a deep love for this game and the first. I give it a 9 simply because the darkness in the game is a little much for people who do not understand things such as mental health issues or for those who do suffer from them. I have personally played and own hundreds of video games across multiple platforms\\, and The Last of Us part 2 is one of the few that has truly moved me. I will say that I do not condone the drama and mishandling of the leaks but that doesn't meant i will turn my back on a wonderful franchise.
