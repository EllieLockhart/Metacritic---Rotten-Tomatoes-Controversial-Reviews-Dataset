Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some cool fight\/battle scenes\\, but the portrayal of Luke's character as a broken man who gave up didn't match up with the Luke from the original trilogy.  Obi-Wan's former apprentice became the galaxy's greatest murderer\\, but you don't see him losing hope.  This movie just really ruined Luke's character.","true":true}
