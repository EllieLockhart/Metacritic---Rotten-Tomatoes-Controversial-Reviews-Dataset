Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes and retcons everywhere. A horrific stain on the face of cinema. It subverts only for the sake of subverting with out the \\\"substance\\\"\\n\\nThe new main cast becomes more uninteresting\\, or just downright insufferable. While the OT cast is used as a \\\"springboard\\\" to shamelessly make the newer characters look good. It also has plot threads that fall into utter abyss. Pointless over saturated padding for the Canto bight (Casino Planet) And the dialogue at times is worse than the prequel dialogue (Not exaggerating) And just over all a bad movie experience. The \\\"narrative\\\" spells a dark future for star wars from if this is where the writers are going. It might just be the worst purchase I have ever made\\, and it's never coming back. This is the type of film that's so bad it should be brought to film schools to teach the next generation of students of \\\"What NOT to do\\\" when making continuation to anything. It has all the red flags\\, and it's just painful and sad to watch.\\n\\nI only give this a HALF a star because the producers had some level of respect to pay respect for Carrie Fisher at the end of the credits. But over all.... This travesty shouldn't even be considered \\\"mediocrity\\\" for how badly this was botched. I recommend you stay clear of this trash at all cost.","true":true}
