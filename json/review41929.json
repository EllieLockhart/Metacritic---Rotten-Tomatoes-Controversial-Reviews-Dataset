Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie I would say is a large disappointment. It's not horrible but by no means does it live up to the what Star Wars should be. It seems to be riddled with poor decisions either in directing or editing. impactful scenes\\, or what should have been\\, were either cut off too early or there was no build up. Overall\\, i left the IMAX bored and unimpressed. There was no suspense\\, i feel the movie was rushed and i really hate to say it but this movie seems like a cash cow....The very few plot developments that were good ended up lost by the rest of the lack luster script. If you are a Star Wars fan\\, you'll see it no matter what\\, I hope you weren't left with an empty feeling like i did. I am in no rush to see the next installment due to how this film was handled.","true":true}
