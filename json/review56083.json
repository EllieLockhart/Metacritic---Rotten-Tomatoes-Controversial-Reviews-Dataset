Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some mild spoilers follow. The Last Jedi is a good but flawed movie - the good is strong character progress for Luke\\, Rey and Kylo Ren\\, excellent use of Leia\\, a logical progression of Force abilities (and no mention of midichlorians anywhere\\, thankfully) and excellent action sequences. \\n\\nThe biggest negative is a sub-plot that frankly drags the film to almost a standstill\\, all to deliver a far-from-subtle message (animal cruelty is wrong\\, kids) to the audience. The Porg's could have been increadibly annoying\\, but thankfully their presence is limited\\, even if they do scream \\\"MERCHANDISING OPPORTUNITY\\\" very loudly. And despite the build up\\, Captain Phasma once again is a huge letdown - although she does get a great fight sequence this time around.\\n\\nThere are some nice twists in here that I\\, personally\\, did not see coming. The return of a fan favourite and the significance of it was kept quiet and it was worth the effort clearly put in to doing so.\\n\\nFor me\\, this is one of the better Star Wars films - easily better than the entire prequel trilogy and superior to the fun but overrated Rogue One. Not as good as Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope\\, it may beat out Return of the Jedi and Force Awakens\\, although I think repeated viewings are needed to firmly place it in my list.","true":true}
