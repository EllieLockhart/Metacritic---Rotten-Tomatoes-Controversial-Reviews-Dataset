Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a huge Star Wars fan I feel let down. The plot was barey good. They disgraced Luke's character\\, Rey still doesn't have a good back story\\, rose and fin storyline wasn't needed. Ren's is still a big baby when they could have developed him better.  Snoke was a huge disappointment. He should have been a lot better character.  No questions answered on him. Like who is he\\, how he got the first order started. I could go on and on.  I left the theatre dissatisfied","true":true}
