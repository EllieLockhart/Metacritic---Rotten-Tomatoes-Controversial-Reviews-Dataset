Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enough has been said about why this movie is so disappointing. \\nBut equally disappointing is that RT appears to have FROZEN the Audience Score. \\nI'm guessing Disney paid RT not to allow it to go below 50%. \\n\\nWell RT\\, you may make money in the SHORT TERM but in the LONG TERM you'll LOSE TRUST and CREDIBILITY and audiences will look elsewhere (e.g. MetaCritic) for serious reviews.","true":true}
