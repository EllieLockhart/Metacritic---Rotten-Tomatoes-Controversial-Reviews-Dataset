Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\/lucasfilm\/Director Ryan Johnson have seriously underestimated the impact that losing many of the old fans will have on this franchise this film has treated the character of Luke Skywalker terribly and unlike usual I won't be going for my 2\\,3\\,4\\,5\\,6\\, screening of this one nore will I be nagging the usual family\/friends to come with me.This film is is so bad Disney has lost a 43 year old life long fan. Good bye Star Wars RIP it's been a blast. Until this film ruined it.","true":true}
