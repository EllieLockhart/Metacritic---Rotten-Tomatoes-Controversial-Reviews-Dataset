Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry to say\\, it's very disappointing. From the lack of any worthwhile over arching narrative\\, to pointless boneheaded side quests\\, to completely ignoring any of the cliff hangers of the previous films\\, to bizarrely motivated or nonsensical actions of characters\\, it's all pretty bad. Lots of plot points just don't make any rational sense. Even art department work on snoke's throne room is an uninspiring let down. Don't bother.","true":true}
