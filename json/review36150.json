Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a truly beautiful film\\, not just in the cinematography but also in the story and how far Rian Johnson is willing to push the limits of a beloved franchise. Rian takes the religion of the Jedi and the power of the Force and uses compelling story and narrative to turn it into something more\\, a balance between good and evil. After seeing a rehash of A New Hope in The Force Awakens\\, it definitely is satisfying\\, and heartwarming\\, to get an all new Star Wars film.","true":true}
