Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much time with new characters... ignoring the fun we had with Finn Rey and Poe in The Force Awakens... a couple of great scenes\\, but too little too late.","true":true}
