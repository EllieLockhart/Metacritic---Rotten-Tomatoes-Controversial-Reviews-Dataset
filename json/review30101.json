Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly\\, despite the good elements being really good\\, some of the major events sucked the life out of the ongoing story\\, and those major events weren\u2019t told in a very interesting or exciting\/dramatic way. There were some subplots that neither advanced the story nor were very engaging. One entire major character could have been removed from the movie and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Add to that a lot of quirky humour during very serious moments (which drained those moments of their seriousness and tension)\\, underwhelming music (no new major theme)\\, and a basic story that didn\u2019t often feel exciting\\, and you have a movie that left me just feeling nothing by the time it was over. I feel like I don\u2019t care what\u2019s going to happen next as major story elements have been destroyed and there was essentially zero cliffhanger. ","true":true}
