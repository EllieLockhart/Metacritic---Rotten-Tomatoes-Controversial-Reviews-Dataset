Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the mixed reviews I enjoyed the newest movie of the star wars saga. Although I question some of the decisions made in the creation of this film overall the plot was original and take risks after episode sevens similar plot to A New Hope. As usual the cinematography and acting was brilliant with Carrie Fisher playing a prominent role in this film.","true":true}
