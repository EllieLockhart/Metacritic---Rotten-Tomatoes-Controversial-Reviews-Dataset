Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is a spectacular movie on so many levels. First\\, ;et me give one proviso. I highly reccomend viewing Episode VII - The Force Awakens first as it explains a lot of the context of The Last Jedi. Now the bare facts. The Last Jedi handles character exposition\\, development\\, and disposition wonderfully. There are many points in the movie where you briefly ask: \\\"Why?\\\" only to have the explanation to become jaw-droppingly clear.  As always\\, the cinematography is amazing. I can guarentee that when people get into long drawn out discussions as to which Star Wars film was the best of the series\\, The Last Jedi will rank among the top of the list of even the most rabid and opinionated Star Wars fans.","true":true}
