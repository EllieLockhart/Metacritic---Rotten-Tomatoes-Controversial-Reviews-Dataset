Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some amazing moments buried in bad dialogue and cheesy jokes which misfire again and again. Seriously the packed theater was silent after almost every joke except maybe one or two. \\nI was very excited to see the development of the new characters and Rey and Kylo Ren were done well but the other characters fell flat. Rose was the worse character in the Star Wars universe since Jar Jar Binks. \\nMovie not as innovative as people are making it out to be. In fact there are a lot of rehashed plots from previous Star Wars movies but not done as well. Movie leaves you right where you started at the end of TFA in fact. And it is worse because the bad guys now are kind of a joke. \\nAnd if you are going to change Luke that is fine but make his change realistic. People do change but for clear reasons and not because the director needed him to change to push along his convoluted story. \\nI have no excitement for episode 9 at all. I normally see Star Wars movies 5-6 times in the theater but no more for me thank you.","true":true}
