Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider myself a fan. Grew up on Star Wars. Earliest memory is seeing the first Star Wars in the theater. The ridiculous fanboy culture that has derided the prequels and resulted in hatred\\, name calling\\, and heinous online behavior needs to get over itself. I did not love the movie. It will not live with me like A New Hope and Empire. But it was enjoyable and visually stunning. My children loved it. It is not perfect but I was glad that it did not remake am earlier film like The Force Awakens did.","true":true}
