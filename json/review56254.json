Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn't so much a Star Wars movie as it is a Star Wars parody that actively hates and largely ignores the franchise it's supposed to be a part of.  On its own\\, it might have been a mediocre movie suffering from bizarre story choices\\, poorly written stereotypical characters\\, and internal inconsistencies.  But as the middle part of a three part trilogy\\, the film ignores several threads raised in the previous movie(s) and seems to outright claim that other points were unimportant or even ridiculous to bring up in the first place.  It almost leaves the viewer wondering if episode VII is no longer canon or if TLJ is some weird \\\"what if...?\\\" Story instead of a sequel.  Whatever story people might have liked within this movie as a stand-alone movie\\, it just doesn't hold up as part of a greater narrative (from the trilogy it's supposed to be a part of to the entire forty year history of the franchise).","true":true}
