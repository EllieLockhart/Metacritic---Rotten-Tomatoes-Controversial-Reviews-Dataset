Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to finally see the rest of Luke Skywalker's story.  I expected what happened to Luke post-RotJ to matter\\, to have some meaning and significance beyond Luke being just another figure in the wider story. This movie\\, for me at least\\, robbed him of the centrality of his story and didn't even bother telling most of what happened to him at all. To say it was painful is an understatement.  Awful.","true":true}
