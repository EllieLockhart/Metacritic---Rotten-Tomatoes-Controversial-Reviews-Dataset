Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the film that the Star Wars saga needed. As a die-hard fan of the franchise since my early childhood\\, I respect and admire Disney and Johnson for their realist approach to the mythology\\, willing and ready to defy expectations at every turn. Beyond the film's sheer narrative weight and deeply emotional moments\\, it cuts into vital new territory that will keep bringing new fans to the series. Bravo. If this is where Star Wars is headed\\, it's \\\"hit the jump to light speed\\\" for me.","true":true}
