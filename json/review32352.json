Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars junkies don't seem to like it. Doesn't respect the old movies. Nonsense! At last this is a film that builds on the best of what went before - discards the rubbish  - and creates something new\\, exciting\\, breathtaking and wonderful. I'm with the critics on this one not Joe Publici!","true":true}
