Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too bad that this movie was definitely not what I thought it was good Ng to be like.  Mark Hamill was right to disagree fundamentally how Luke Skywalker was going to end. At least George Lucas kept fundamentals together even if the acting was terrible.  Seriously Luke needed to act like Yoda before he passed away as well. Sometimes keeping the formula of something that was once great doesn't mean it's the correct thing to use again.","true":true}
