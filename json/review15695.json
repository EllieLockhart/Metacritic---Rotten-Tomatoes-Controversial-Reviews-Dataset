Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\, i love what they did with Luke\\, I loved all the homages to the original series\\, with their surprising twists\\, and i loved all the action that takes place in every fight. Rey's understanding of the force is well explained\\, Kylo Ren becoming an unhinged maniac is a good way to raise the stakes against the resistance\\, and no one can hate the porgs. My one issue with the movie that prevents the full five stars is that some scenes tend to drag on a bit long\\, but thats it\\, there's no other complaint i have\\, The Last Jedi is too good.","true":true}
