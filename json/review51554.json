Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A couple of decent scenes\\, a cool salt planet setting and a nice twist aren't enough to save this massive disappointment. Corny dialogue throughout\\, over-the-top expressions\\, the tired Star Wars formula thinly veiled as something fresh\\, and a cringy scene where the Princess [and maybe the franchise] jumps the shark - all add up to an experience that wasn't worth waiting for\\, much less paying for.","true":true}
