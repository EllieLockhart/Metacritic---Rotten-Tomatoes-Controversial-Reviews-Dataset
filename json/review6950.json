Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the best in the saga. The \\\"fans\\\" who are crying the loudest about this film are mad because Rian Johnson didn't use every video game cliche'of the past 20 years and decided to make a truly original film. Don't give in to the hate.","true":true}
