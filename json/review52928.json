Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An okay action movie\\, an awful Star Wars film. The Empire has fallen from a well ordered menacing war machine to a group of bumbling fools lead by children. Luke has lost all of the wisdom and soul he had in the original trilogy . He contemplates murdering an innocent child\\, refuses to help his friends and loved ones\\, and \\\"sacrifices\\\" himself for a insignificantly small band of rebels. Supreme Leader Snoke is a what a child would write in as a scary villain. His motivations are never explained\\, he is shown for 10 min and then abruptly killed off so the audience can get a unexpected twist. Comedic moments ruin any tension that is built up\\, they are far to numerous and frequent. Gags and one liners are almost as bad as in the prequels\\, they feel forced and add nothing to scenes. \\nThis movie feels like a kids TV show but with a 100 million dollar budget. Disney has dropped the ball on this one. Disney needs to go back and watch the original trilogy\\, because this movie feels nothing like what one would expect as a sequel.\\nI wanted to love this movie and I feel so disappointed in what could have cemented the new Star Wars trilogy as how a sequel should be made.","true":true}
