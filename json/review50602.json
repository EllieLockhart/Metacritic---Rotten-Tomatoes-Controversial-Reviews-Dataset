Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3hrs of shitty one liners from a afternoon 90's sitcom. \\nFull of dated Liberal messages through the entire movie.\\nVery poor acting\\nTons of wasted fillers just to make it longer\\nThis is the worst one ever.\\nOnly good thing are the action scenes and cinematography.","true":true}
