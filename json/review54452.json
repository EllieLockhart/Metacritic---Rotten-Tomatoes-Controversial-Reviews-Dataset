Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll start off with the good. The music and art\/setting are all good and bring the look and feel of the Star Wars universe to this film.\\n\\nNow\\, the bad:  Pretty much everything else.  The characters are flimsy and unrealistic.  I didn't even know what the term \\\"SJW\\\" was until seeing reviews of this film and looking the acronym up. \\n\\nNot liking what I'd heard of Rianne Johnson's Disney sponsored mess of this film\\, I waited to view it until it was available for digital rent.  I'm glad I waited. \\n\\nThis really feels like an episode of some chick sitcom with a bit of Star Wars thrown in.  The original characters of Luke and Leia have been bastardized.  The original Leia was willing to see an entire frigate's crew sacrificed to get the Deathstar plans delivered to the Rebellion.  The SJW Leia demotes her best pilot and loyal officer for sacrificing a few light bombers to destroy a large enemy capital ship.\\nThere's just too much hypocrisy and estrogen here.  Shame on you Disney for bastardizing this franchise and IP.  \\n\\nFurther\\, (spoiler alert) Admiral Holdo should be court-martialed\\, posthumously\\, for failing to wear a uniform.\\n\\nRose (spoiler alert) should be court-martialed for sexual harassment for forcing a kiss onto a colleague without his consent.\\n\\nWith the SJW commentary out of the way\\, the \\\"science\\\" part of this \\\"sci\\\"-fi movie is woefully lacking.  I'm a big SW fan and realize that SW was never super accurate when it comes to the science of space\\, etc.  however\\, the opening scene (spoiler alert) has bombs \\\"falling\\\" in space.  Wut?   Further\\, the open-to-space bomb bay doesn't (spoiler alert) push out a crew member.  Wut?  \\n\\nAnd that was just the opening scene\\, this nonsense continues throughout the movie.  With movies like \\\"martian\\\" and \\\"gravity\\\" being enjoyable and successful\\, I can't see why studios insist that audience members are too stupid to have a little bit of science with their sci-fi.  It's insulting. \\n\\nRianne Johnson\\, having been given the reigns to write and direct a SW film should have at least been required to watch the previous films and read some of the canon available for the SW universe.  \\n\\nAs a SW fan\\, I'm done with Disney's \\\"kelvin timeline\\\" version of star wars until they kill off Mary Sue rey\\, design realistic characters that have depth\\, bring some science back to \\\"sci-fi\\\"\\, fire Kathleen kennedy for destroying a star wars movie with her SJW agenda\\, and don't ever let rianne Johnson near another SW project.  \\n\\nThis movie isn't star wars. It's something else\\, and it's really not very good.","true":true}
