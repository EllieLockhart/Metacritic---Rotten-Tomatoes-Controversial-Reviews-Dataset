Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is time for the star wars to end!  Who is Snoke?  Who cares lets kill him.\\nRey the most powerful force user came from drunk losers.  This movie was more sabotauge than film making.  lets kill off all Lucas ideas so we can say we created star wars.  This movie deserves the Razzie!  I am still in shock that Disney would produce this trash.  Anyone can be a force user now\\, hahaha.  the dark side and light side would never team up.  Oh ya when can I see a saber fight?  it feels like Disney took a large dump on all fans heads","true":true}
