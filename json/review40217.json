Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the STAR WARS you're looking for!\\nVisually it's a great movie. Beautiful effects\\, space ships\\, computer animated animals\\, light saber with consistent thickness\\, it's got it all! Really fun to watch and also amazing music\\, once again brilliant! \\nBUT the story? I am SHOCKED about how they wrote the saga in a new direction (NOT good)! The characters are badly developed\\, it feels to me they (writers) were just going for the SHOCK\\, rather than actually good storytelling. \\nWhat I really want to say to Disney: \\\"Look\\, when you buy something like STAR WARS you can't just kill of the past (pun intended) and feed everyone some substitute low-calorie\\, light\\, tasteless powder! Just add water and it's awesome. NO\\, NO! You want the audience to focus on the new character\\, fine. But guess what? We actually CAN follow more than TWO UNSURPRISING\\, FLAT characters!\\\"\\nWell... it makes me angry\\, because you let me down. You let me down as a fan and let me down after waiting TWO YEARS for this. For THIS?! You must know I loved the movie when I saw it for the first time. Just after such a long time waiting\\, getting al hyped up and making up the most ridiculous story in my mind\\, I wanted to see it so badly that I was blown away by the actual film. Because it was shocking and new. But that is the thing\\, I believe\\, will make it a BAD STAR WARS movie in the future. I hope STAR WARS will be around in a couple of years still and one day\\, looking back at all this\\, we all will go: \\\"This is not good!\\\" because if you put all the other films together they make sense! They're not perfect\\, some are in fact not even decent\\, BUT they deliver to the whole story. And now this story got to a grinding\\, painful halt! I can see they literally wanted to kill of the old\\, expensive cast and replace it with new\\, cheaper actors. This hurts so much!\\nI believe the story is not bringing up an urge for more\\, really. Well\\, it's really kind of over and it's fine. No wondering about Jedi\\, no more asking about the looser Snoke and apparently the force is strong with random kids we just happen to meet. So what you did there is effectively kill a past (pun intended) off that was around for 40 years. SHAME ON YOU!  \\nWhat really angers me the most is that THIS is now How.It.Happened. It's official\\, approved\\, signed\\, sealed\\, delivered STAR WARS story. IRREVERSIBLE! \\nUNLESS: They continue with bad writing\\, like the old B-Movies back in the day\\, and the start of the next episode will be someone waking up and declaring it was a terrible\\, bad-story-telling\\, confusing and long nightmare. Making it invalid\\, destroying this outrage of a move and moving on to get an actual GOOD STORY!\\nMay the force help us all!","true":true}
