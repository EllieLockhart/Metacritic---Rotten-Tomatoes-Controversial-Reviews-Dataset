Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If considered in isolation - The Last Jedi delivers an entertaining\\, status-quo adventure space-epic for the big screen. In context of the franchise itself - the film consciously subverts and dashes the preceding character and story development so heavily that fans may no longer know what to look forward to. Although containing arguably the greatest light-saber fight scene in the anthology\\, its lack of restraint for comedy is sure to timestamp the film with contemporary humor certain to fail the test of time.","true":true}
