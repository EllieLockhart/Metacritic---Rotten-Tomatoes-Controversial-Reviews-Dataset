Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As all Star War fans\\, you have to see it. But was disappointed over all. Too generic\\, not creative and still using most of the basic story line that is starting to get very old. Wish the writers would get better to make each episode a lot deeper. Just don\u2019t have much desire to see it again. ","true":true}
