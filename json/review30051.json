Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Run\\, don't walk to The Last Jedi.  Is it Gone with Wind? Hell no. However\\, it may be the best one of the series so far. Without revealing anything\\, I can give you the following complaints 1) it is a bit long 2) even in a sci-fi flick\\, it asks us to accept some things that we normally would not accept and 3) there are some strange characters and lines. Complaint 3 is also a benefit. I liked the attempt at humor\\, and some of the strange characters offered something. The best thing about this movie is it uses standard star wars themes and even some scenes\\, but takes them on a different path. It is not predictable\\, and it absolutely does not answer everything. I loved it. I left the movie still wanting more\\, and I still want more answers. Nevertheless\\, I feel like the story advanced and I got some answers.","true":true}
