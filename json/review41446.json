Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is as epic as it is audacious. It turns core characters and principles of the saga totally on their heads and reimagines them. The longest movie in the saga is also surprisingly the fastest-paced.","true":true}
