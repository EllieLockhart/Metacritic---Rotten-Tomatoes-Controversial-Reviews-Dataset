Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was kind of disappointed... It was very exaggerated. Leia wakes up in space\\, we still dont know who are Rey's parents\\, Luke dies along with Snoke\\, Captain phasma\\, Admiral Akbar\\, we see Maz only once.. its not at all like the old star wars\\, they sadly changed all the story.. Unfortunately i liked that they put some humour in it!","true":true}
