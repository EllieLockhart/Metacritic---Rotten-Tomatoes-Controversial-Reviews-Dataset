Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I couldn't go below half a star. By far the worst movie in the the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson should never have been given the opportunity to touch a Star Wars movie. JJ Abrams gave him so much to work with from The Force Awakens\\, and Rian hardly used any of it. And what he did use he screwed it up in the worst possible way. Sad that Disney allowed such a poorly written story.","true":true}
