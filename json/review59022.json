Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Well. After playing for about 23 hours i can finally review this game. Killing Joel in such a heartless and rushing way was something which i can't and won't forget. . As he went to the city in Part 1 with Ellie by car\\, he instantly knew what the hell was going on\\, as some random people apparently needed his help. You could argue that after 4 years you get lazy and start to trust people more. But it's Joel: A character who is very stubborn and wants to avoid any risk at any costs\\, so it's not very likely that he would change even a bit. Playing Abby was no problem for me\\, even if she was the killer of Joel. But nearly half of the game? Damn. No way. In addition the game tried to make the player emotionally attached after killing Joel. I can say that in my case it showed the absolute opposite. I had literally no emotion left at all because all i waited for 7 years was torn apart after not even 2 hours in such a horrible way. Scenes in Last of Us Part 1\\, which still make me so emotional and makes me nearly cry till this day; while playing Last of Us Part 2 i felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. After debating if the game is good or bad\\, i decided to do neither of it. So it's a 5\/10. Rest in Piece Last of Us. I will always remember your first part as the only part\\, which remains my favourite game of all time forever.\r\rPros:\rGraphics\rGameplay\r\\\"Quick Time Events\\\"\rNice side characters like Jesse or Gina\r\rCon;\rStory\\, which is of course the most important part in a story game\rsome boring passages while playing\u2026 Expand","true":true}
