Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie. I love Star Wars but not obsessed. Movie had a few cheesy lines but not very predictable. Few parts I was completely shocked and yes you don\u2019t get any action till like towards the end but it can\u2019t always be about that you need some of the story! Love the actor\/actress of Rey\\, Ben\\, and Po. Overall a good movie! I would go see it again. I can\u2019t wait for episode IX ! ","true":true}
