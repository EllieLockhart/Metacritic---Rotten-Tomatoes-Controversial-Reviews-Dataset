Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse than Phantom Menace and by all means. Complete disaster.\\nThat film has ruined everything I held dear about Star Wars. They turned Luke into whinny useless simething\\, he died a completely stupid pointless death. What a waste of the most beloved character!\\nI'm no longer interested in your star wars\\, i dont care about Rey or Finn\\, since all the characters I cared are now gone\\, and gone stupid. I understand you cant have them forever\\, but why like taht?\\n With this attitude the franchaise goes down the drain. Prequels were not that bad after all.\\nAnd that casino part was totally useless\\, oh my god\\, how can i erase from my memory the existance of that movie?","true":true}
