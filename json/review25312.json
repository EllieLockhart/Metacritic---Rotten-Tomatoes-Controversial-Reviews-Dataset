Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No honestly. All the reviews must have been bought. I cannot see how this is a good movie in any instance. I'm a big Star Wars Fan and liked both the Original Trilogy and the Prequels and while the Prequels were definitely no masterpieces\\, they were still pretty enjoyable and had the feeling of legit star wars movies. Not this one. I was extremely disappointed with Ep. 7 too\\, but i could see the appeal and overall i had fun. But watching Ep. 8 was a pretty unsatisfying experience. Not because it was a bad Star Wars movie only (IMHO) but also a bad movie overall.","true":true}
