Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many glaring flaws.\\n\\nAll women are super-powered\\, heroic\\, wise\\, already trained as Jedi from the womb\\, great leaders\\, and need never condescend to tell any \\\"boys\\\" what the plan is; particularly when the plan is stupid.  All men (even\\, surprisingly\\, the black men and the \\\"Masters\\\") are cowards\\, emotional\\, stupid\\, reckless\\, untrustworthy and wrong for trying to heroically sacrifice themselves to save the day.  That's a women's job.\\n\\nAt no point does any of the \\\"plot\\\" have anything to do with cannon or continuity or go anywhere.  Basically the plot is stupid.  \\n\\nCharacterization is avoided at all costs.  Bad people aren't threatening\\, good people aren't honorable.  War profiteers make weapons for both sides (violates SW continuity\\, and has happened almost never in history:  IDIOTS)\\, and they apparently like to gamble their earnings away.  What movie universe is this anyways?\\n\\nBack in the day princess Leia was tough\\, beautiful\\, and dug heroic guys:  What's wrong with that?  What is this thing?  A lesbian fantasy film?\\n\\nRemember when Star Wars had strong lady leaders who actually briefed the troops and told them what they were up against?\\n\\nAnd if the good guys were running the galaxy\\, why do the bad guys have so many more shiny toys?  Fish in a barrel:  Everything is wrong with this movie except maybe Mark Hamill giving an earnest star-turn performance in spite of the bad script.","true":true}
