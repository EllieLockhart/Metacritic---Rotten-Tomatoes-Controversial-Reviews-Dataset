Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The SW franchise needed this movie and update. Of course the force doesn't belong to anyone. It belongs to everyone. I love the thought that everyone in the SW universe has a place and part in their fight either with or against two extremes good and evil. In the end you need both to bring balance. So while this was a fresh update it also stayed true to the original films. Everyone who is hating on it will NEVER be happy. So I'll continue ignoring the haters.","true":true}
