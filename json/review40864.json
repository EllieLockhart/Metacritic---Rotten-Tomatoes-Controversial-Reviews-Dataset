Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie confused me. Maybe that was Johnson's intention--to throw your Star Wars expectations out the window. It takes some very surprising turns. As a huge fan of the originals\\, these turns are a little difficult to stomach. I do think Star Wars needed a fresh direction and this certainly does that\\, but so many of the turns are too jarring\\, not paced well\\, poorly written and thought out. This felt more like a Disney movie in Star Wars clothing. I liked parts of this movie but just as soon as it drew me in\\, it kicked me out.","true":true}
