Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars the last jedi it's a great movie \\, very different from the others movies in the saga \\, it's exciting whit good characters management and not at all predictable\\, it's a spectacular movie and my opinion it deserves five stars","true":true}
