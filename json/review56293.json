Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars TLJ (2017) is better than TFA (2015)\\, and it is likely better than The Rise of Skywalker because comparatively\\, TLJ has much better writing than TFA. Rather\\, the TFA is a rehash of the Star Wars IV (1977) with the empire making a death star weapon. I enjoyed that TLJ is more about democratic and equality rather than royal and bloodline. Indeed\\, In the beginning of the film\\, Luke talks about whole the force doesn't belong to just anyone\\, but to everyone. Talking more about details would give too many spoilers. However\\, I am disappointed that JJ Abram who wrote TFA returns to write TRoS. Indeed\\, I dont even know why Star Wars 9 is even titled with skywalker unless JJ Abrams is going to make the force basis go back to royal bloodline\\, which is stupid. I blame the fanatical audience who refuse to change for such likely change again.","true":true}
