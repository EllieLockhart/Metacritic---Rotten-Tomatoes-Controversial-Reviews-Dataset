Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like the movie. I did enjoy Episode VII quite a bit\\, and really liked Rogue One. The Last Jedi now leaves a very bad aftertaste. Admittedly\\, when I got out of the movie\\, I thought that the very last part had salvaged some of the major flaws of the storyline and had provided a somewhat satisfying experience. But then\\, too much of bad storytelling had happened...\\n- Leia as Mary Poppins - come on! This was likely the worst scene EVER in the Star Wars franchise\\n- The forced and unnecessary Finn\/ Rose interaction\/ distraction. This was so boring\\, did not move the plot forward and was in the end simply annoying. The Finn character took damage here\\n- Luke's role is perhaps not as bad as I have seen some reviewers made it to be\\, but it is also very unsatisfying and results in the dismantling of a Star Wars fixture\\n- The casino planet scenes served no purpose. The whole part was ridiculous\\n- I would rate it the third worst movie in the Star Wars franchise (sorry\\, still can't get over JJB)","true":true}
