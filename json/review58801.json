Most agree that the first installment didn't \\\"need\\\" a sequel\\, but there were still some loose ends that left it as a possibility\\, and this game covers them in a satisfying way.\rThe gameplay and visuals were absolutely phenomenal. It improves upon what made the first game great\\, and deserves its place as a next-generation continuation of a PlayStation classic. New features such as the ability to prone\\, tall grass that obscures enemy sight\\, and the dodge mechanic offers players more options to either cunningly stealth their way through well thought out maps or simply engage aggressively - there are several ways to approach every scenario but the game doesn't pigeon-hole you into one playstyle.\rStory-wise\\, this game has divided its playerbase in ways I've never witnessed in all my years playing video games. However\\, you shouldn't take this as a bad thing necessarily. This narrative does require you to come into it with an open mind. If you have rigid expectations coming this and aren't open to immersing yourself in the story that the writers were going for\\, you're doomed to hate it. Go into it understanding that the writers love these characters as much as the fans do\\, but fully respect the nature of the universe in which they exist - a lawless world where right and wrong are not determined by any singular mind or governing body. A world where you must seek your own form of justice when you are wronged.\rPersonally\\, I absolutely loved the artistry and effort that was behind crafting this narrative. The writers have had many successes in their previous projects and they easily could've played it safe and followed a similar formula that guaranteed them another homerun\\, but they opted for a route that was riskier and explored darker aspects of human nature that other creators are either too afraid to explore\\, or missed the mark in their attempt. For that\\, I am thankful that this game exists.\rFor as much praise as I am willing to give it\\, it does have drawbacks. There is a point in the game where it builds momentum and leads to what feels like a climax\\, then abruptly takes a sharp left turn and the pace grinds to a halt and the buildup back to a climax restarts. I don't think this particular narrative would've worked as well as it did if this didn't happen\\, but it did leave a sour taste in my mouth at the time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
