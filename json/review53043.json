Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a true Star Wars fan who grew up with the originals\\, I will say that this is another good film by Disney\\, I believe this was a good follow up to Force Awakens\\, I only hope they expand on Snokes story and explain more. Disney keep it up\\, Now make a Darth Vader stand alone\\, a Darkside movie that truly covers more of the dark side Training etc maybe Darth Bane(he is canon since he was in Clone Wars)\\, an Obi Wan with Ewan\\, a Boba Fett movies.","true":true}
