The graphics are incredible and the gameplay is slightly better than the previous with new additions to help your survivability\\, but the story is the equivalent of a car crash. I saw all of the leaks before release and still thought that there was a chance that playing would change the context and perspective and I was correct. It changed it so negatively that I couldn\u2019t look away as one of my favorite franchises was butchered before my eyes. Neil Druckmann stated that this game is about hate and I fully understand that now. I hated the game being leaked\\, I hate the direction they took the story\\, I hate the character decisions that seemed out of place\\, I hate the reviewers giving mysterious positive reviews claiming it\u2019s a masterpiece and I hate myself for buying this game. One point for graphics and another for gameplay. Nothing else deserved it. Also\\, what kind of revenge story (which is played out already) ends with no revenge for the main character? And by main character\\, I\u2019m referring to one of the two people we looked forward to playing as\\, not bland and boring Abby.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
