Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move was awful. It was full of plot holes\\, useless characters\\, disappointing use of established characters\\, and continues to have a Mary Sue as the main protagonist. The only enjoyable portion was the character arc of the main antagonist.","true":true}
