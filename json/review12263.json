Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a star wars purist. If you take the movie as it is\\, it's great. I can certainly see why some people won't like certain aspects of the film\\, particularly how they choose to portray Luke Skywalker. The way it ends with him seemed rushed. I do like what they're doing with Rey and Ren.","true":true}
