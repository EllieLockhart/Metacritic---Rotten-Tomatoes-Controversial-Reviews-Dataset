Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie that showed great character development for both Rey and Kylo. The movie shows the use of the force in an exciting way that is Star Wars fans have been waiting for. The force finally does more than just lighting\\, choking\\, and persuading! Great Movie!","true":true}
