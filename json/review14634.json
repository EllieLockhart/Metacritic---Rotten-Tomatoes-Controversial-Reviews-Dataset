Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have finally seen this movie. I grew up with Star Wars and I think that whoever wrote the movie does not know Luke Skywalker. His character is not this person of the film. I feel as the franchise will continue to make money\\, they dont care about people who grew up with them. I prefer my daughter to watch the originals\\, at least they make sense. I hope people wi stop acting like it's a good movie\\, its not.","true":true}
