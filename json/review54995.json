Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was highly disappointing. Replaced the worst movie of the series for me. It was too obvious in its plot\\, ie snook being killed and the guy who betrayed the plans. Favorite moment was when the rebel ship hyper jumped into the first order command ship. Disliked po basicly taking a back seat for the just to complain the whole time. But that does fit in ith the typical skywalker character.....\\\"I Was Going to Toshi Station to Pick Up Some Power Converters\\\"\\nAnother note this film pushed feminist themes up the wall with more useless characters than what the series had previously. Leia\\, Fisher\\, was a great example where the themes were still there but they werent in your face every single time the character spoke. Really should have pulled from other star wars movies and shows on how to make a strong female lead other than Leia. Examples would be like Ashoka Tano\\, Padme\\, Sabine Wren\\, or Jyn Erso. All of those were awesome and strong female leads. \\nFinally I came for the action and battles that the series is known for\\, not sitting listening to a slow drawn out chase of running permanently out of fuel for an hour.","true":true}
