Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great action scenes with a good continuation of plot from the last episode. However\\, too many cuddly creatures and a stupid side plot nearly ruin the show. Sadly\\, it feels more like Episode I than Episode VII. ","true":true}
