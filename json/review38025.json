Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars saga continues to go down the toilet on this one. No plot\\, empty characters and shame on Mark Hamill for letting  them destroy Luke Skywalker like that. Half a star is a half too many!","true":true}
