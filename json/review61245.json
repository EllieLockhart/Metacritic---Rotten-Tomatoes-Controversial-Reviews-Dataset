Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"*I'm gonna find and kill every last one of them*After almost 30 hours of gameplay\\, ellie loses almost everything her friends\\, and finally has settled down. She ditches her family (Dina and her kid)\\, to go kill Abby for one final showdown\\, and after losing 2 fingers and finally getting her moment she had awaited she lets her go. It left me enraged and with an empty feeling.Killing hundreds of people\\, dogs\\, a pregnant women\\, and  brutally dismembering Nora\\, suddenly she has an epiphany\\, that killing is bad!!? It's just poor writing.Being forced to play with Abby was the worst part of the game\\, playing with a character that kills one of the most beloved characters. just shows how badly the writers took joel for granted.
