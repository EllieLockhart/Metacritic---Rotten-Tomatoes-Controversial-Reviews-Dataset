Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was born in 1971. I \u201cwas there\u201d along with so many other people my age who feel that their childhood was\\, in some ways\\, defined by Star Wars. I\u2019m a grown man with a family and a life\\, but Star Wars will always have a special place in my heart - it\u2019s important to me. The Last Jedi is a mess on so many levels. It feels like Rian Johnson just doesn\u2019t quite get Star Wars. As a story teller\\, I felt that he kept missing the mark and continually left me feeling emotionless. The Last Jedi is huge disappointment and frankly\\, made me sad. ","true":true}
