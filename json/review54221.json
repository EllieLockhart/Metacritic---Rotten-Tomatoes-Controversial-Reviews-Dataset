Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you forget everything about star wars and try to watch this as a stand alone movie it can be enjoyable.  There just seemed too much pointless stuff with this movie\\, i.e. its entire subplot. Why even put that in the movie!!! It had no purpose whatsoever!! Nor was their even a single light saber fight which is unheard of. But the most disturbing part of the movie was emasculating all the men and turning this into  a women's franchise. Don't get me wrong\\, I love strong female roles but this was overkill on a whole other level. The way its going women are going to become all the jedi and men will be their bag carriers.","true":true}
