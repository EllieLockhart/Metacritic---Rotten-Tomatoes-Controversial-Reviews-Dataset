Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was such a great film. It set a premise to step away from the typical Lucas films and demanded to make its own step in the Star Wars universe without trampling on what was already made in the other movies.\\n\\nIf you have no seen this\\, go see it. Make your own opinion about it. Don't let the fake Audience score get to you\\, it has a 90+% rating from actual critics for a good reason. You may not like it because it takes a drastic step away from the already set space opera that star wars was\\, but you may like it for the fact its changing the star wars universe to something more interesting and open ended.","true":true}
