Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The idea was let's make a Star Wars trilogy  where  the protagonist and antagonist has absolutely nothing to do with the  previous Star Wars trilogy.  Let's kill the main antagonist in and the greatest hero of the franchise as well.  The great thing about Star Wars is that it's about family\\, and this one pretty much ended that.  Mark Hamill himself came out early and in public saying he didn't like the direction of the characters.  That should have been a red flag for the studio.  So disappointed that the potential of these characters went absolutely nowhere. Johnson dropped the ball.  2 stars for the special effects and acting.  Unfortunately that didn't keep this movie from being a disappointment.","true":true}
