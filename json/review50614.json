Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3 star movie when it could have been a 5\\n- feels draggy\\n-illogical things leia becoming superman when her death was better\\, rebel ship chase was stupid just light speed ahead!\\, Rose saving Fin when he tried to sacrifice himself\\, holdo not explaining her plan when a better idea wld be for the rebels to turn\\, evac at the back of the ship and immediately lightspeed into the dreadnaught.\\n-unnecessary mutiny and fin n Rose love subplots \\n- Fin became boring\\, Rose was super irritating. I barfed in my mouth when she kissed fin. Not believable. It was cringey the way they set it up.\\n-I don't know Snoke. what\/who\/why\/when\/how? cld have just replaced the unnecessary subplots for Snoke's backstory.\\n\\nWhat I liked:\\n- the comedy was good actually\\n- brave decisions to change star wars predictable story\\n-luke and kylo's acting. holdo and fin was bad boring but the rest were okish.\\n-good visual effects\\n-I actually like that Rey didn't receive much training but Kylo shld have some dark side power training sequence.
