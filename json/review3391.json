Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best frickin movie ever. You can throw that audience score in the garbage. The exciting thing about TLJ is its exploration: what can the force do? WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT? Go to the bathroom before\\, because it's almost 3 hours of STRAIGHT STAR WARS.","true":true}
