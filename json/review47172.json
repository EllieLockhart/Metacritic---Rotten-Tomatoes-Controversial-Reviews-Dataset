Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a missed opportunity. I don't understand all the critic praise. From a pure story telling standpoint\\, the film is all over the place. One of the 3 major arcs of the movie could be resolved if characters simply communicated with each other. There are very cool scenes within the movie\\, but it feels like Rian Johnson totally blew up the franchise which is the biggest crime of this movie. It definitely will making re-watching TFA worse and might even sour a bit of the original trilogy. I am severely concerned about the future of my favorite franchise of all time.","true":true}
