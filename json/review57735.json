Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed by this movie\\, by the strange plot points\\, not using Finn and Poe very well\\, Loved Rey and Rey and Kylo Rens performance were great though.\\n\\nI hate grumpy old Luke and his story\\, This is not the Luke I know or wanted to see!\\nIt's like Rian Johnson saw all movies\\, but especially force awakens and thought: \\n\\\"Nah dont want that! I dont care! I do my own thing! \\nSnoke? dont care! \\nPhasma? Dont care! \\nJedi Master Luke? Dont care! \\nReys history? dont care! \\nThe force? Pff the force whatever we want it do\\,\\nForce training? why do you need training?\\n\\nF the old fans\\, Star Wars is for young kids\\, we need fun\\, we need comedy\\, humor\\, selling toys. Its not supposed to be serious! we dont care. It needs to be like superheros! We dont care about the history! Skywalkers? pff... dont care. The old should die!\\\"\\n\\nI am a Star Wars fan since my childhood\\, 25 years ago\\, and I have never been so sad. The movie itself is cute and pretty\\, its just the disrespect it shows to the past!","true":true}
