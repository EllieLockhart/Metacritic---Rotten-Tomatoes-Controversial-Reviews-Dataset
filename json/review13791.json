Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found The Last Jedi to be a very poorly written and badly directed movie. To me it was the worst Star Wars movie in the whole franchise with all this political bs getting shoved down our throat\\, the original characters getting spit on and no effort on actually trying to tell a compelling Star Wars story. Shame on Lucasfilm for pushing this SJW crap in my face and telling me to either like it or get told that I'm a racist white supremacist who hates women if I don't.\\n\\nMy advice to everyone who wants to see Star Wars? Go watch the original trilogy. Don't waste your money on this SJW crap.","true":true}
