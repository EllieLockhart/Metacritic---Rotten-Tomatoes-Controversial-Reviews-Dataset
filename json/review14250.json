Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore all the \u2018fan boy\u2019 negative bulls**** reviews! They only hate because the movie they created in their head was not realized on screen. Get over it!! This movie was fantastic! It was beautiful\\, compelling\\, exciting\\, funny\\, and explored the lore of Star Wars perfectly! Well done Rian! I can\u2019t wait for what the future brings!","true":true}
