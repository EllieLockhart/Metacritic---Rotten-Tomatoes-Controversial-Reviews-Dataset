Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving it 5 stars. There are great moments in this movie along with some not-so-great moments. What director\\, Rian Johnson did was to move the story forward and to give center stage to the absolutely dynamic presence of Rey and Kylo... the screen melts when they are the focus. That alone gives this movie 5 stars. I want more of those two... unbelievable! There are side stories that were forced. There are some big names (one in particular\\, who should not be in this movie. The original stars are somewhat marginalized but not in a horrible. I'm an original Star Wars fan and understand the complaints coming from other fans. But\\, you cannot turn back the clock to 1977. The story has to move forward. I'm glad that JJ will again take the directors chair for Episode 9. He has a great respect for Star Wars and will close it down in a wonderful way. Go see this movie again.","true":true}
