Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is amazing! It may not be the top of the SW pile (Empire is on top) but it's damn great! TLJ gives this new trilogy a new direction and sets up stakes that will have great impact on the future of the series. The acting is amazing\\, the characters are fleshed out\\, and the action is awesome! Not sure why it is getting so much hate. I feel it's not justified! This film is a great time at the cinema!","true":true}
