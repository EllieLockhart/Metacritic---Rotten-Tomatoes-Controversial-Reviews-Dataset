{"101487":155199,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MY EYEBALLS ENJOYED WATCHING IT\\, BUT MY BRAIN WOULDN'T LET ME REALLY LIKE IT.\\n\\nI went into this movie with zero opinions. Didn't read anything about it\\, didn't follow it at all.\\n\\nThe greatest improvement of The Last Jedi over The Force Awakens is that it didn't copy it's original trilogy counterpart as much\\, though there were still plenty of plagiarized scenes with throw away lines that tried to unconvincingly tell you that this is totally not the same as Empire.\\n\\nThe visuals were gorgeous\\, and there were a couple of real heartwarming moments\\, but once you've seen it\\, your mind will start to review what you've seen and come to the conclusion that in all other ways this movie is basically a tire fire.\\n\\nMark Hamill's return as the grumpy old Luke-alike was well done and I thoroughly enjoyed him\\, as long as you ignore that all of the events leading up to his self-exile were an enormous character assassination.\\n\\nRey is more of a Mary Sue now than even the definition of the trope can explain because it's amplified by her ridiculous mastery of the Force... but she is charming\\, like a Mary Sue should be.\\n\\nFinn and Rose's entire subplot might as well not exist and the movie would have been better served using the 40 minutes of that on actually making the rest good and filling in the plot chasms.\\n\\nPoe Dameron was OK. Under the circumstances he was behaving like any critically thinking person should\\, even though the movie will try to tell you otherwise.\\n\\nThe writing\\, structure\\, and editing of this movie is easily the worst of any Star Wars. Cringe worthy lines occur regularly\\, and stupid jokes that break dramatic scenes and then don't land well for most of the audience are sprinkled throughout. Character development is basically non-existent for anybody\\, new or old. It basically insults your intelligence but you don't notice at the time because of the eye candy.\\n\\nWorld building that keeps the fantastical elements of Star Wars within reason and believable has gone completely out the window for the sake of spectacle. I guess if you wanted to distance your Star Wars from old Star Wars you would do something like this movie\\, but it can't even maintain continuity within itself\\, let alone from its direct prequel. It's like the director looked at what was done before\\, lit it all on fire\\, and wrote his own fan fiction.\\n\\nPlot points and teasers set up in Force Awakens go untouched\\, or blatantly discarded. Who's Snoke and where did he come from? Doesn't matter\\, he's out. Rey's parents? Forget it\\, they are nobody. Kylo's mask and his persona of intimidation? Get rid of it because the old guy made fun of him. Finn got his spine raked by a lightsaber and goes into a coma? Nah he wakes up and shows no signs of being injured at all despite the fact that the time between the two movies appears to be less than a week. Why would Luke leave a map to find him if he left to go die in a corner? Captain Phasma? Still a non-character with like 4 lines between two movies; a shiny suit to sell merchandise that may as well not even have anybody inside and it wouldn't make a difference (strong female characters ftw?).  Knights of Ren? Who now?\\n\\nThis movie didn't just take a dump on the original trilogy\\, it took a dump on its own. I wasn't a fan of FA because I walked out of it thinking\\, \\\"I've seen this movie already.\\\" It was just A New Hope with modern visuals\\, and I guess some people are fine with that (I can't fault the visuals)\\, but I wanted new content. \\n\\nIn hindsight\\, however\\, The Last Jedi is inferior to The Force Awakens in every way\\, which is the saddest story of all. JJ Abrams will try to repair what has been done by this movie\\, but he will fail spectacularly because Rian Johnson is a complete twat.\\n\\nThis new trilogy is officially not Star Wars to me. I just don't care about anything in it. It's not canon. The real canon is the Expanded Universe. This new stuff is children playing with forces they don't understand.","true":true}
