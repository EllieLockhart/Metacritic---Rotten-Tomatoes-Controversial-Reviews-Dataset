{"101487":187399,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review will be spoilers so do not read ahead if you care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis movie was ENTERTAINING but it was not GOOD. This movie deliberately destroyed Star Wars mythos as a response to the criticisms of Episode 7 being a reprint of Episode 4.\\n\\nThere is a lot of action\\, a lot of spaceships and explosions\\, better choreography\\, interesting set designs...that's all nice.\\n\\nWhat there was almost NONE OF was plot development\\, character development\\, resolutions to problems\\, answers to questions...anything of substance that you would look for in a movie that tells a finite and coherent story. Don't expect any of your questions to be answered\\, especially in a meaningful way. \\n\\nKylo Ren has NO motivation for being evil based on his characterization\\, while Rey had NO reason for wanting to be good or opposition Kylo after the hour or so they spent building romantic tension between them. Rey is actually a nobody\\, which I don't mind\\, but that raises MORE questions about how she was able to best Kylo (who has been studying his entire life) and Luke (who is a literal Jedi master) in 1v1s. She's a complete mary sue with a decent personality\\, but no point in the story.\\n\\nI liked Finn the most of the new characters\\, but Finn and Rose's plot was basically a worse version of Rogue One. Phasma was wasted (killed off unceremoniously). Snoke was wasted (killed off unceremoniously). Leia somehow turns out to be immortal although Carrie Fisher is dead. Luke basically suicides to become godlike for 2 minutes\\, so the rebellion can survive\\, but he says he is not the last Jedi which makes ZERO sense.\\n\\nWhy is Rey a jedi? Two days of training? She doesn't come from the lineage of Jedi\\, hasn't been trained as a Jedi\\, Luke outright said she didn't make ANY effort to resist the darkside\\, she hasn't read any of the Jedi manuscripts\\, and believed Luke\\, The Jedi\\, and the Sith were all myths before encountering them in EP 7.\\n\\nYoda says some bullshit about \\\"she has all the info inside her already.\\\" Why? Why do you have to wait 3 movies to even figure out what our main character is? Kylo is the big bad now? Why? He wasn't evil before Luke attempted to murder him\\, and even then even Luke knew it was because Snoke was brainwashing him. Now that Snoke is dead\\, what motivation does Kylo have to want to stamp out the resistance besides just not liking old things?\\n\\nThis movie is dumb and meant to pit new fans against old with its constant inconsistencies. \\n\\nRian Johnson created a story with so much dialogue and gotcha moments meant to be deliberately unpredictable just to shove it to anyone who was previously invested in the story. Most of what was built in EP 7 was thrown away. They introduce a new commander just to have her suicide on a pointless mission in which she gets almost everyone killed anyways.\\n\\nEven after all the iconoclasm they STILL copy beats from EP 5 and 6. I don't hate this movie\\, but it shouldn't be called Star Wars.\\n\\nHell\\, I liked ep 7 (not part of the Star Wars fandom) but ep 8 was long and pointless. Watching EP 5 and then Rogue One is a better substitute.\\n\\nIf you don't care about the original story and characters\\, only hopped on board with EP 7\\, or are one of those people who want to \\\"shove it to old fans\\\" because you somehow feel more hip because you didn't spend time reading the EU or watching 4\\, 5\\, and 6\\, this movie is for you.","true":true}
