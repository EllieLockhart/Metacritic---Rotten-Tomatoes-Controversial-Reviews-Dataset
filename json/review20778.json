Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie\\, I really did.  But with cartoon villains\\, pointless characters (like Snoke)\\, numerous plot holes\\, Luke's character assassination\\, Leia becoming Mary Poppins in space\\, a boring overall story (especially the casino planet side adventure) and certain events that made no sense whatsoever like bombers dropping bombs in space despite no gravity.  Some of the action sequences were fun to watch even if they were mostly pointless.   I rank this movie barely above  Attack of the Clones but just barely.","true":true}
