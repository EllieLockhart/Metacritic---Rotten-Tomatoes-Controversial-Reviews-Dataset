Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I was hoping that that would not be a disappointment\\, but sadly I was disappointed. It was a bitty film\\, with a thin plot line\\, over-engineered jokes\\, poor acting\\, and rapid annihilations of key characters (Snoke). I thought the Rey\/Kylo-Ren communication sequences were poorly presented. I had the sense that Disney were going to tire the franchise slowly after watching this. Perhaps the breakout films should be the future focus...maybe even long TV seasons would allow for a richness that the recent films have failed to achieve.","true":true}
