Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie that made no sense.  I gave it 1 star rating only because it was visually stunning.  However\\, the plot made no sense and it felt as though Rian Johnson did not like any of the characters or ideas Lawrence Kasdan and J J Abrams introduced in The Force Awakens.  Luke was out of character.  The chase in space made no sense.  Leia pulling a Mary Poppins made no sense.  The trip to Space Vegas made no sense.  I almost fell asleep four times during this movie.  It is the worst Star Wars movie of all time and could be one of the worst movies ever made.  The bottom line:  If any other person except Rian Johnson would have proposed this script to Disney\\, Disney would have rejected it.","true":true}
