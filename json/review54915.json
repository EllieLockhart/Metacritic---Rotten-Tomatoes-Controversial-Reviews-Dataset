Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's legitimately the only Star Wars video (including movies\\, animated movies\\, television\\, with the exception of The Christmas Special) that I have no desire to ever watch again.\\n\\nHell\\, I gladly went to the 3D release of The Phantom Menace on opening day\\, and that was my least favorite at that point. The difference is\\, TPM felt like Star Wars. It knew what it was\\, and though it is certainly not without its flaws\\, it's Star Wars. I can't help but love it.\\n\\nTLJ on the other hand\\, felt like a slap in the face as a lifelong fan. It unapologetically \\\"subverted [my] expectations\\\" merely for the sake of doing so\\, destroying much beloved characters in the process. The movie itself practically beats you over the head with the notion of\\, \\\"This is Star Wars now. If you liked the old Star Wars\\, too bad. It's in the past\\, and you have to kill the past. You're not the fans we're looking for.\\\"\\n\\nI actually really enjoyed Solo on the other hand\\, but... I honestly don't look forward to seeing Episode IX. I will see it\\, because I love Star Wars. I want to see if they somehow remedy Rey's apparently pointless past or Snoke's absurdly anticlimactic death. But the fact of the matter is\\, because of TLJ\\, this is the first time ever I'm not anxiously awaiting the next chapter. I'm actually kind of dreading it; hoping beyond hope they don't irreparably cripple my all-time favorite universe.","true":true}
