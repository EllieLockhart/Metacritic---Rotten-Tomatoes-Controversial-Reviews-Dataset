Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson a true fan of Star Wars and the mythology of the franchise created a magnificent film that really brought forth some great questions about the Force and the Jedi's place in this new era. Fantastic music by John Williams again and the visuals were gorgeous. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were great and it was so amazing to see Luke Skywalker on the big screen again as Luke Skywalker. The final performance of Carrie Fisher is one of the best she ever gave and she will be missed. Chewbacca was great as always. Daisy Ridley again brought forth new depth and development for Rey and Adam Driver's performance commanded the screen with Kylo Ren's character. John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran\\, and Laura Dern were fantastic too!","true":true}
