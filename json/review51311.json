Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible.\\nRuined the Star Wars legacy\\, plot\\, and conformity.\\nThe fans just wanted to see some acknowledgement to the backstory of rey or snoke.\\nRe do the movie... make snoke be darth plagueiis and give him a fucking back story. Make rey a kenobi. And ffs make the fight scenes as good as the prequels.\\nThis movie had the ground work done and the build up to be something so good but it was ruined.","true":true}
