Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not tell a story. The movie is all over the place\\, it leaves more questions that answers. I cannot watch another Star Wars movie due to the Poor Writing and SJW bs that entered the Franchise. \\nI am not a fan of this movie or the crazy vision the writter or director is going. \\n\\nI will never purchase this trainwreck of a movie.  \\n\\nGod Damn\\, I can make a better story. Shit the novels where 1000 times better.","true":true}
