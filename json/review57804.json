Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*WARNING - ENCASE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS HORRID FILM\\, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\n\\nMy god. The way they treat Luke is unbelievable. The constant\\, campy\\, inappropriate humor is terrible and distracting. The movie sporadically builds and then dies and leaves you feeling confused\\, unsatisfied and cheated. Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn and Ben are extremely bland and uninteresting in this movie. Their personalities seem dumbed down. I had bought tickets the day they went on sale for opening night and for the following morning and I skipped the second showing. Seeing this movie once was more than enough. Wtf happened? I legitimately feel embarrassed to be a Star Wars fan now that this movie is out. I honestly can't believe what they did to this franchise. The damage is done.  They're not getting anymore of my money until they pull off a 180 from the dumpster fire that is this movie. I'm certainly not seeing the SOLO movie and letting them ruin han for me too.  I am hoping and praying they pull Rian Johnson from his trilogy he's been given because it's absolutely ludicrous to allow that man to touch anything involving this franchise ever again after what he did with TLJ.","true":true}
