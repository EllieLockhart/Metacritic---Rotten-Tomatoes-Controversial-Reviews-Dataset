Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very different from the rest of the saga\\, but honestly\\, I thought Johnson's take on this film was interesting and entertaining. The characters are still great and so are their story arcs\\, the humor wasn't totally sucked out\\, and it was WATCHABLE unlike Episodes 1 and 2!!!!","true":true}
