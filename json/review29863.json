Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One and The Force Awakens felt like Star Wars Movies. The Last Jedi IS a Star Wars Movie. I have genuinely never left the theater with more elation than when I left Episode VIII. This movie takes Star Wars back to its roots thematically\\, all while expanding and shifting everything you thought you knew. Rian Johnson will be worshipped as Irvin Kershner has for generations to come. Fans won't like this movie for the same reason they didn't like The Empire Strikes Back in 1980. Because it takes what was known and expands it beyond our own imaginations. And for that\\, I thank the man who will get his own trilogy\\, and finally the man who gave us the character we've been looking for since 1983; Luke Skywalker","true":true}
