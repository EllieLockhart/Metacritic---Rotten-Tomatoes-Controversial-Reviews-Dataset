Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi alienates half of its fan base because instead of being a Star Wars film. Rain Johnson decided to make it a political statement. \\n \\nMen are the Root of Evil\\n\\nCapitalism is Evil\\n\\nThe old ways are wrong\\n\\nThis is why people are so divided with this movie because it is trying to push a belief that only 50% of the people believe in. Star Wars is supposed to be a fun enjoyable fantasy world that most everyone can escape to but Rain Johnson has turned it into a political nightmare.","true":true}
