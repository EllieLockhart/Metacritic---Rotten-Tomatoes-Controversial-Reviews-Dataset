Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first experienced how unimaginably atrocious this film truly was i found myself confused on what had just happen. After finally digesting the unfortunate reality of this movie I wrestled with the question of how someone could create something so blatantly horrendous? I grew up loving star wars. How could something so disgraceful be allowed? I didnt believe it was possible. This then led me to believe that it must have been done this way deliberately. And not just deliberately\\, but it seemed as if great time and care was taken to destroy every aspect of the star wars universe piece by piece\\, along with everything its fans love - the story\\, its characters\\, its excitement\\, the inspiration\\, its lessons\\, etc. Just a few examples of this are the senseless and almost comical death of snoke (one of the few intriguing characters of the film)\\, the complete butchering of Luke Skywalker's character who was of course once a powerful and honorable jedi\\, the awkward and unbearable joke attempts\\, and the fact that this so called star wars movie did not contain a light saber battle. Yes its true\\, no light saber battle in the entire movie. The list unfortunately goes on and on and on with scenes so baffling that it made me wonder why I was ever a star wars fan in the first place. It's no wonder I've never actually talked to anyone who didnt strongly dislike the movie\\, which makes one wonder how the ridiculous critic reviews were so suspiciously high\\, but that's another story. Overall\\, in the end\\, I just had to remind myself to not let 1 movie dismantle what I and so many fans have come to love. IT'S JUST THIS FILM. The best I can do is act as if the movie never existed\\, and the universe of star wars may live on.","true":true}
