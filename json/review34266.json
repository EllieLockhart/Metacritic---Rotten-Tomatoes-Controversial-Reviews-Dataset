Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 14th worst movie I have ever seen. It is exciting and looks very nice\\, but nothing anyone does makes an iota of sense. These failings are compounded by horrendous plot holes\\, broken physics\\, inexplicable deviations\\, pointless use of previous movies' characters\\, unbounded magic\\, and almost no plot. Any good acting; which there certainly was; was buried under confused and awkward character development. At no point did any of the characters have a moment of realisation or comprehension; instead\\, they won by default. The self promotion of merchandise-able materials was gross and distasteful; Porgs. I would implore you not to go see this movie\\, but we all know that the marketing machines behind it are far too powerful to resist.","true":true}
