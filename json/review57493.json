Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This plot was Garbage!! Total garbage. This movie felt like one looooong star wars rebels cartoon show where the movie could have been condensed into a 30 min show with commercials. Jj abrams and rian have destroyed the essence of star wars\\, luke and the force. Where i could have watched it 2 or 3 times now I Will never watch another star wars movie again. LET THE PAST DIE. KILL IT IF YOU HAVE TO.. For me star wars is dead!!!!","true":true}
