Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this movie was Super hyped\\, So many questions to be Answered\\, none were\\, if you were a Fan of Luke Skywalker since 1977 & followed his saga all these Years prepare for disappointment\\, There is no big Luke fight or anything he just dies. Very opening secne the rebels have only heard of a 1st order Dreadnought through rumours\\, but some how Poe in an outdated X-wing fighter disables it all alone! Less then a 3 minute fight between Fin & Captain Phasma & she's  dead. Supreme Leader Snoke who is the most skilled with the Dark side of the force\/or force in general is killed off with the simplest force trick. As cool as porgs are they seem like an overused marketing character used too often for after movie sales. The use of Yoda Jedi master to burn thousands of years of Jedi lore is not cool it's  desrespectible. Along with wiping out all Sith. This director would have been better of being in charge of an offshoot like Rouge One\\, Not the Main Franchise. Not happy! Erase from Starwars Cannon.","true":true}
