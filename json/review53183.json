Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a fan since 1977 and I understand that things need to change but what I saw today was a terrible Star Wars film which lacked consistency\\, decent humour and compelling characters. We got little in terms of new characters and seemed stuck with tried and tested formulas from previous films (disguise as officers to infiltrate a ship etc). Rey had the least interesting plot which left here staring out to the side of the screen most of the time. Finn was just Finn. Poe Dameron had the more to do this time but was in little danger throughot. Luke was reduced to a broken shell of a man which is certainly not what I wanted to see and Leia becomes Supergirl for no reason (Needs to be seen to be believed). Some strange plot holes and logic is nowhere to be found in both warring parties. I mean\\, why fly straight at the enemy and be shot at. Even bombs must be dropped down in space where gravity does not exist. Redeeming features are nods to classic era but not enough to save this instalment.","true":true}
