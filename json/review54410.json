Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know this is a Disney movie and we should expect it but the heavy handed liberal message is unacceptable.  This is a movie intended for enjoyment - not to be indoctrinated with: men = weak\\, useless\\, and untrustworthy.  Rich = evil.  Relgion = false\/bad.  Old ideas = to be killed.  Animal racing = bad and\/or mistreatment.   Save that garbage for a documentary or a political drama or even a comedy but not in this movie.  Disney didn't even have the decency to hide the message in the movie they jyst rammed it diwn the viewers throat evey scene possible.  In an effirt to support your agenda at Disney you attacked and bludgeoned your audience with your message.  shame on you for your inclusiveness lesson being wrapped in hate.\\n\\nEven if that was remotely a mistaken opinion on my behalf there is still the issue of dialog being less important than spectacle.   Thread holes too big  to ignore.  Most importantly\\, the sin that is inexcusable - the complete misuse of and intentional complete destruction of Luke. There is no excuse or story driven reason to justify the choices made with this iconic character.  Congratulations Disney on becoming the new emperor and letting the dark side win.  Shame on you!","true":true}
