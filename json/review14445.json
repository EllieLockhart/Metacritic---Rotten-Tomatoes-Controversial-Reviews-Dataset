Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to see it twice. The first time I gave it a solid 7.5. But the second time i saw it I gave it a 9.5. The issues I had the first time were gone. I loved every second of it. The story was amazing\\, the action\\, and I cant wait for whats next.","true":true}
