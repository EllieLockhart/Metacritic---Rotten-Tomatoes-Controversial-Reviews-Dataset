Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had been a lifelong fan of star wars until I saw this movie.The plot holes in The Last Jedi ruin not only this movie but ruin the entire franchise for me. In particular\\, what was done to Luke Sykwalkers character in this film did not make any sense\\, nor did it do any justice to a true hero.  Hyperspace ramming will ruin any future star wars battle.. if only they just put a hyperdrive in a old space ship they could destroy a star destroyer with one kamikaze pilot.","true":true}
