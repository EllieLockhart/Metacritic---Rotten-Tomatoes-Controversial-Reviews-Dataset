Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has serious problems with its plot\\, its pace and the development (or lack of) of their characters\\, especially Rey\\, the main character.\\nHowever\\, this is not its biggest problem. After all\\, this is Star Wars\\, we can expect some plot holes. The main problem are the messages this movie tries to tell the audience. The movie tries at some point to be original and explore new concepts of the lore of SW\\, and\\, even if it doesn't do it well\\, it's a nice try. But the movie\\, instead of continuing through this path\\, runs away before coming to any conclusion and retreats to the old cliches.\\nThis movie doesn't know what it wants to tell us\\, and therefore it is in my opinion the worst SW movie of the eight (yes\\, worse than any of the Prequels).\\nWhat I can't understand is how anybody would defend this movie for its \\\"creativity\\\" or \\\"courage\\\" when it is clearly and utterly coward.","true":true}
