Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely entertaining but that's it. Some CGI was atrocious and had story lines that made no sense because they could be conflicting with past films or even within the dynamic in this same movie. The Rey\/Ren relationship kept this afloat certainly and hopefully will be explored further.","true":true}
