Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning but narratively flawed in so many ways. Really cheapened the story arcs of a number of (major) characters from earlier in the saga through misuse of tropes and conventions unique to the universe. Failed to realise or capitalise on the setups created in episode 7. Equals Attack of the Clones for inexplicable silliness (jet propelled R2 = Flying Leia). Added to this is the misuse and underwhelming demise of the (arguably) main character in the entire saga.","true":true}
