Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What this movie doesn't have in common with the other Disney produced star wars movies is that it doesn't feel like a star wars movie. I loved TFA\\, and i really liked Rogue One and Solo\\, But this movie feels out of sorts... The plot set up from TFA is completely ignored and turned into what feels like some art house indie film experiment.","true":true}
