Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that destroys the legacy of Star Wars\\, full of plot holes\\, contrivances\\, every interesting moment being undercut with ridiculousness\\, and mostly bad attempts at humor. It made me consider the new sequel trilogy noncanon\\, and I will not go see episode nine in a cinema - it will be the first Star Wars film I will miss on a big screen. I do not want to reward Disney's corporate masters for their mediocrity.","true":true}
