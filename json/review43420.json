Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a phenomenal Star Wars film. Expertly executed\\, and files away many of the terrible decisions made in The Force Awakens (Why they've decided to go with J.J. again is beyond me). Star Wars will never come closer to capturing the human spirit and heroic tone of the original trilogy than this\\, I feel. Some awkward scenes (Leia Mary Poppins comes to mind)\\, but ultimately made up for in excellent editing\\, cinematography\\, and design.","true":true}
