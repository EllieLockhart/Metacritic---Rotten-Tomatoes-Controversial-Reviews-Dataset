Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst of al the Star Wars movies.. Rian Johnson showed he had 0 interest in keeping Star Wars lore. Kylo is actually Rian Johnson in the Star Wars universe wanting to destroy everything like a bratty child who's happy with nothing. New Characters Rose Tico and Holdo were awful. They both sought to submit 2 male lead characters under their own control. One used a cattle prod and the other talked down to the best pilot in the resistance as if he were a child who shouldn't know what Mommy and daddy are plotting.  The story went no where... and Lead Actress Daisy Ridley overcame absolutely zero adversity to become a Jedi. The Jedi history is all about trails.. padawans going thru tough scenarios to learn and become one with the living force. She did jack...  the attempt at comedy fell flat in my theater... awkwardness was the feeling of Poe pretending to be holding on the line... same with the reaching out to feel the force. Rian is awful...\\nThe half star is for the beautiful scenes n some creatures... it was like looking at a dogpile of shit with glitter and sprinkled tinsel all over it. The movie\\, story\\, and characters stunk... but at times the shots of scenery were shiny n beautiful","true":true}
