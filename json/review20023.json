Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was hard to watch. No back stories. 2 completely irrelevant scenes that should be scrubbed from any movie (milking and shirtless). Horrible! Taking something with such a beautiful and profound foundation and changing it because you want to be a rebel yourself doesn't make you witty or cool - it makes you an a**hole\\, Rian. Shame. Shame on all of it","true":true}
