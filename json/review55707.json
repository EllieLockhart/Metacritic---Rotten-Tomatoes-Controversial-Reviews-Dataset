Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pay little mind to the 5 star reviews.There is no such thing as a perfect movie.This movie is so far from a Star Wars movie. Many of the Star Wars nuances that we have grown to know and love are non-existent. A flat story plot\\, force fed joking moments\\, and Rey holding her own against Red Guard as if she is trained AND SHES NOT\\, made this movie so much of a let down. UGH! This is worse than epi.1 the phantom menace. Disney and Kathleen Kennedy\/Rian Johnson will do no right for the Star Wars franchise. IDC how the third one shapes up\\, this series was ruined by Rian Johnson and attempted to paint the original movies as a croc. I am finished with Star Wars as long as Disney is involved.","true":true}
