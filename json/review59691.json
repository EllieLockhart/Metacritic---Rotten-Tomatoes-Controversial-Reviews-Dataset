Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"7 years for this?! now the story is absolute garbage the graphics are not impressive and the game play is basically the same as the first one but with a little bit more stuff. the reason the story is really bad is because of a lot of things but the one that was so bad was Joel's death and the ending now Joel's death was so underwhelming i teared up when Sarah died in the first game but when Joel died in TLOU2 i laughed because his death was just so ridiculous after Joel dies its basically a copy of the first game the only difference is that there are no characters to like or relate to\\, you just go around shoot some soldiers if you are not doing those things its just a walking sim. the ending is just so bad they tried to be like OH REVENGE BAD UWU FRIENDSHIP and its just really bad. Abby is so masculine that people thought she was transsexual but i guess in an apocalypse where food is scarce Abby can just be hulk and her character is even worse\\, naughty dog tries first to make Abby look good and then they make us absolutely hate her and then she becomes the \\\"good guy\\\" and the game tries to make Ellie and Joel look like the villain which is really stupid. TLDR The graphics are not insane but they don't hurt to look at. the game play is boring because you don't really have a reason to play since the story is an absolute dumpster fire and the ending doesn't leave you asking for more but instead it feels like a terrible fan fiction. Don't buy this game the \\\"professional\\\" reviews are fake this game is not even close to being a masterpiece. just.. a disappointment.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
