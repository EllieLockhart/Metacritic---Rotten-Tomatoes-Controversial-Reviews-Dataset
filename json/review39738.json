Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie! I recommend seeing it a second time because it can be a lot to take in\\, and I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. Everything that you need is in this movie\\, great music\\, great acting\\, great effects practical and non practical\\, callbacks to the originals\\, Star Warsy humor\\, impeccable action\\, and a great plot!","true":true}
