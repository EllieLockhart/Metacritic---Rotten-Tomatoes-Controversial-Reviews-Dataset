Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is simply one of the best movies in the Star Wars franchise. Fully taking the film and cemented the franchise for a new audience\\, and looking forward to the future over what has come before\\, but not disrespecting it as many would seem to believe. TLJ builds on Star Wars' past to create a wealth of new possibility for the series going forward. \\n\\nIt returns the Force to its' more mystical roots\\, sets up a powerful dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, and creates a greater sense of what heroism is\\, beyond destiny and legacy. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a risky move\\, but undoubtedly one that ultimately pays off and will give franchise scope to go to all kinds of powerful places in the years to come.","true":true}
