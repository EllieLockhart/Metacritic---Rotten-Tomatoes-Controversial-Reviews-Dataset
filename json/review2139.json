Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As usual the movie was overhyped and one massive let down. The story plot for one\\, is confused and extremely flawed. the last Jedi is extremely boring and could have been reduced by an hour for a better thrill. There is almost no action until the very end. Kylo Ren character has become a disaster. Will we ever have a good light saber battle? cheezy acting cheezy lines its lacking originality. This movie offered a dire glance at the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
