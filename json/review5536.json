Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroys the entire saga. For us fans\\, not critics\\, star wars is more than just subversive story and poorly planed characters. We had theories\\, excitement\\, who is Snoke\\, who are Rey's parents\\, what did Rey's vision mean\\, what will Luke bring to the situation... Turned out Snoke is dead\\, Rey's parrents are nobody\\, Anakin's\/Luke's\/Rey's lightsaber is now destroyed and Luke is dead. Not to mention other stupid and un logical moves pulled by studios and heroes.\\nAll in all\\, this could be okay if it is a stand-alone sci-fi movie\\, but as an 8th installment of a franchise that has the biggest fan base in the world and had the best movies in the universe.... It is not worthy. #disneysucks #ryanrethinkyourlife","true":true}
