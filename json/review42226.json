Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie spends too much time on unfunny jokes and pointless plot twists that take the movie nowhere. The movie also wastes 30 minutes on the Canto Bight which is the most uninteresting and boring thing that I've seen in Star wars since Attack of the Clones. This movie also underuses and wastes Finn's character\\, which is a shame because he had one of the most interesting backstories of any Star Wars character. Rian Johnson also does not seem to understand the rules of the Star Wars universe\\, and trying to watch this movie after the Original Trilogy is frustrating. On its own\\, this movie could shine\\, but it doesn't seem to have a place in the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
