Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics say The Last Jedi honors the saga which is complete bullshit. The entire movie was a stab at the original saga over and over again. The major spit in the original ideology of the Jedi. They turned Luke into a push over cry baby with constant stabs at what Lucas created. We get it Disney you are rich as hell and bought Star wars but I am sorry people did not rush into the theater because of what you are doing to destroy what we grew to love they are rushing in because of the name Star Wars and Star Wars alone. You can take your Donald Duck Storm Troopers and shove them. Episode 9 better start off as 7 and 8 being a vision from Luke if he failed to train Kylo properly or I hate to say my once all time favorite hobby and content to lose myself in is gone. JJ's and Rian vision needs a mega wake-up call. I am never one to attack a directors or writers vision. Star Wars was not their vision it was a purchased universe that should have had some respect when being tampered with.","true":true}
