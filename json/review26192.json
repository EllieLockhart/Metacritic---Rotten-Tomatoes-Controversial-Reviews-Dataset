Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure if I just expect less from Star Wars now but I enjoyed the movie. The acting was mostly pretty good. Knowing how amazing Mark Hamill is I feel like he phoned this in a bit. Much like The Force Awakens\\, this movie basically recycles scenes and schemes from other episodes with slight twists. It's guilty of the same sins of TFA but fun.  Since the movies aren't stopping here they could have abandoned the black and white absolutism. They could have built something new instead of shoring up the old foundation to launch from there. Kylo is again the most interesting character (possibly. lack of dialogue means Adam Driver's physical acting is great. His emotion and desire and urgency play on his face and in his voice) only to be a punching bag\/fool at the end. Still worth seeing.","true":true}
