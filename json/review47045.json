Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a dissapointment. So many stupid childish scenes. And the main plot? We have 4 ships and we are going to float until we run out of fuel... come on. And how can Leia float through space with no space suit but you know who dies by making a projection of himself.. so much trash","true":true}
