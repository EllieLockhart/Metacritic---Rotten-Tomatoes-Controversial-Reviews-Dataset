Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is a soaring triumph for Star Wars\\, performing the greatest piece of storytelling magic it can: making the Old new again. It boasts a strong core story centered around Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren whilst also developing its supporting cast - in particular the character of Poe Dameron. It does stumble a little with a somewhat unfocused but strong second act\\, but the third act activates the hyperdrive and leaves it all behind with beautiful action\\, thrills\\, and a respectful send-off to a Star Wars legend. Moreover\\, the message of the film is reiterated in its conclusion and is perhaps the most heartfelt gesture to its audience Star Wars has ever given - the light doesn't die with the Jedi\\, the Resistance\\, or any of the protagonists. It lives on in us\\, in our belief in the legend of Star Wars. As long as we believe\\, hope will never vanish. If this is the quality we can expect from Rian Johnson and the team for his future trilogy\\, the franchise is in good hands.","true":true}
