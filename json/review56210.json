Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is a space opera which is meant to be poetic and full of mythos. That's the point of Star Wars. This film seeks to tear down that mythos and lay a foundation of...what? That the heros of the past just become burnouts who's stories and actions only evolve a narrative based around a hyper-capitalistic war-economy on a galactic scale? Absolute nonsense. This film\\, and its immediate predecessor\\, are the two laziest films in the saga\\, story-wise. The characters are fine\\, but their arcs are undeveloped and pointless. The events that take place are preposterous\\, even for the physics avoiding nature of past SW films. The only thing worth seeing in this entire film was the 120 seconds of Luke's apparition\\, squaring off against Ren. That was the Luke Skywalker we should have been presented with for the entirety of this film and should have been introduced to in the Force Awakens. Luke would never contemplate killing a child\\, would not run from his feelings to an uncharted island planet and would not ignore the plight of the galaxy.","true":true}
