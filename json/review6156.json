Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney didn't hire the fanboys to write the backstory to our favorite characters. Boo! You can't have humor in a Star Wars movie. Boo! \\nThis is a brilliant edition to the Star Wars canon. The fanboys have mostly lost their minds in speculation. This movie was brilliant because it didn't do what we all expected. It took us and it's characters on a journey that we didn't expect\\, and could barely imagine. The baton has officially been passed.","true":true}
