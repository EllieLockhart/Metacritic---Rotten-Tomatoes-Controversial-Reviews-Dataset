Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I should preface with a note that I am probably a littler more than an average Star Wars fan. I've read some novelizations and I've played KOTOR. This movie smacks of Disney wanting to rewrite Star Wars into the most meaningless drivel that they can string along for a lot of future paychecks. The movie does nothing to progress the plot of of Star Wars\\, beyond cutting it from its roots\\, effectively freeing DIsney from the Skywalker story line\\, and allowing them to continue making 'Star Wars' movies for years to come. This is certainly a better MOVIE than any of the prequels\\, but as for Star Wars it undoes everything. All of the expanded universe. It deliverers no  back story on Snoke. And it only give the most meager of motivations for Luke wanting to end the Jedi order. Beneath the veneer\\, this is actually more hollow than the prequels.","true":true}
