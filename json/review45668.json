Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very entertaining.  I am not sure were all these 1 star ratings are coming from. Sure\\, there were some plot elements that didn't make sense and some of the humor seemed shoehorned in but overall I was pleased.","true":true}
