Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a shame this movie got so much backlash. It's personally my favorite Star Wars\\, even though it feels a lot like a rehash of Empire Strikes Back. It has stunning moments\\, gorgeous visuals and just in general some of the best moments of the whole Skywalker Saga. ","true":true}
