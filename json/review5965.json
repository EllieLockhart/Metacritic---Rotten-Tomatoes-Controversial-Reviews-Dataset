Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing sequel. \\nSpoiled characters and wasted opportunity\\, almost throwing away the best characters. \\nmark hamill said in interviews he was not happy with the direction luke took\\, and I'm not surprised. The last jedi is two fingers up to the loyalist fans of the originals. Finns whole arc in this is pointless other than to set up a battle and preach animal welfare\\, Snokes character development must have been left for a book as there is no back story here. \\nAlso nowhere else to take these characters after this. Good luck J.J. Abrams.","true":true}
