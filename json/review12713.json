Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could waste my time pointing out all the plot holes or how they ruined one of the best characters of the franchise\\, but there is not much more to be said. Rian Johnson is a good\\, up\\, and coming filmmaker\/writer (check out Knives Out\\, Looper) but not for Star Wars. I wasn't thrilled with Force Awakens and believe Harrison Ford\\, the only reason why that film is watchable. I thought things would go up from there\\, boy\\, was I wrong. I knew this was going to be shit show\\, right when Poe\\, did the mom joke at the start of the film. I haven't bothered to watch the sequel\\, and I don't think I will ever.","true":true}
