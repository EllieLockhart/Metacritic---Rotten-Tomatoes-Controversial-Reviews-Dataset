Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film effectively begins the end of the Star Wars franchise.  There are so many issues with this movie that it would take an entire book to cover it all.  If you're not a thinking person and are just into special effects and light saber fighting then you'll love this movie (which explains the high rating with rotten tomato critics).  But if you like good story telling and good character development then you are going to be greatly disappointed.  From the opening scroll\\, you slowly get the feeling that \\\"this is not the movie you're looking for\\\".  Again if you're looking for a sci-fi fantasy film with no substance and aren't familiar with Star Wars then you will like this film.  However for the rest of us who love Star Wars and grew up with it\\, this was a disappointment and I problem won't see another Star Wars film again.","true":true}
