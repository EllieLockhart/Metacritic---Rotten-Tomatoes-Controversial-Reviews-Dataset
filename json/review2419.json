Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very boring movie. No characters are developed. Rey continues to be amazingly skilled at everything with no effort or explanation. The light saber moves were.. embarrassing.. They looked like 5-year-olds flailing around. The comedy was not funny and ruined the drama. All of the character motivations made no sense. It was just.. bad. It looked pretty! But that's all that it did well.","true":true}
