Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's true...All of it. Disney has ruined Star Wars.\\nIf you want to see a Star Wars movie that has been rebooted to appeal to the Twilight movie crowd\\, this is here for you.\\n\\nSo much wasted potential. So much social political commentary in mostly scenes. The legend of Star Wars died here. They did not know it (Disney\/ Hollywood) but this was the last chance for them to get it right. \\n\\nThere is so much wrong with this movie. And it has all been stated at length. All they needed to do was pull one true Star Wars fan off the street to tell them this movie was not close to working for fans of Star Wars or fans of cinema in general.\\n\\nThey already made the money off this franchise. But at the cost of their reputation.","true":true}
