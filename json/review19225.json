Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's my least favorite star wars movie. After rogue one it was disappointing because rogue one is only passed by empire strikes back IMO. I really felt rogue one showed Disney knew what they were doing. I enjoyed the force awakens too (and solo!) But TLJ just crapped over everything I was expecting and hoping for. Rian Johnson cared too much about \\\"subverting expectations\\\" than to give a story that made sense and would please the fans. It seems like he wanted it to be shocking like empire but he failed.","true":true}
