Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can count on the fingers of both hands in my life the times I have been genuinely surprised.  This movie surprised me TWICE.  I absolutely loved this and this comes from someone who saw the original trilogy in theatres.  It carries SW forward into something bigger and better; the action and intrigue remain while adding a touch more humour and creating a film that has more depth and character than any that has come before.    Sorry if you came looking solely for big\\, dumb fun but this is Star Wars that feeds the kid in me as well as the adult.  I'm still trying to figure out what they could possibly do for an encore!","true":true}
