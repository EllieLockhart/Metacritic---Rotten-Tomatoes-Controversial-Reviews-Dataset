{"101487":180055,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie of all time. No main characters have a light saber fight...are you kidding me? There's barely any light saber fights and the movie is TWO AND A HALF HOURS. The dialogue is worse than any of the prequels. The actors always seem like they're acting. The most entertaining part of the movie is a minature penguin with big eyes and he even got old. The new jedi woman is a good actress\\, but the screenplay is so terrible. It's another modern American cinematic tragedy with a bunch of stuff blowing up\\, no character development\\, no care for the characters\\, and bad acting. At least the prequels had Ewan McGregor\\, yoda\\, and Liam Neeson. It felt like it was trying to be politically correct. Oh\\, all of a sudden\\, an asian woman\\, a black person\\, and a mexican together! But they're the only asian\\, mexican\\, and black person you see in the movie...retarded. Oh\\, and the new Boba Fettt is a woman! How scary! The new commander of the rebel army is a white woman with purple hair who looks like she's on her period in every scene\\, and somehow\\, we're supposed to like her. Hmm.....there's a scene\\, and I'm not spoiling anything because the movie spoils everything\\, there's a scene where yoda destroys the tree where the last record of jedi wisdom is in......no yoda\\, didn't destroy the jedi legacy\\, J.J. Abrams and whoever wrote this piece of garbage burned that tree. Why would Yoda do that? Only J.J. and his writer could do such a thing. And they did. It says on Rotten Tomatoes that the critics gave it 91 % ....yeah right! Look at the critics.....they're like \\\"San Francisco J.J. Abrams Newsweek\\\" and \\\"Nebraskalive.com\\\" someone must have paid someone from Rotten Tomatoes to pretend like the majority of critics loved it.....just look at the audience score. 48 % ........and that's being nice. I give The Last Jedi 7 and a half percent. Oh and the bad guy always loses\\, such a villain! He always lost in the first movie and he just keeps losing\\, oh! What a bad guy! And he comes across as a whining child....that's enough. 7 and a half percent only because of the minature penguin with big eyes","true":true}
