Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Missing the beautiful landscapes\\, the surprising inspiring stories. Feels like number 7\\, even less exciting. Far too predictable plot\\, borderline boring heroes...  disappointed. Of course much better than episodes I\\, II and III and still worth seeing even just for the curiosity of it or for some few special effects\\, besides the super weird Flying Leia.\\n\\nMissing whoever did \\\"Rogue One\\\" which was so well done.","true":true}
