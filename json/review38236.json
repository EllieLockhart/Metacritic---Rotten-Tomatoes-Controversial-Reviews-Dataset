Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were spectacular along with the music\\, and was a great movie overall if you were focused enough to notice little details that foreshadowed events later on in the movie with throwbacks to the old star wars films. I see a lot of people complaining about the comedy of the film\\, but seem to forget it's aimed at children with a new generation of character's that will replace the originals. I'd just recommend to watch the film for yourself to take in the general aspect of it. Really enjoyed the audience and their cheers and laughter\\, hoping to watch it again with my little brothers.","true":true}
