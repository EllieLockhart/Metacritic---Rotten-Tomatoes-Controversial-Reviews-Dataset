Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. It did not seem long at all. I'm fan that does not expect anything\\, simply because the story is not mine\\, so i'm glad they keep doing it\\, and I have the movies to enjoy. I have watched twice already\\, besides watching I\\,II\\, III\\, Rogue One\\, IV\\, V\\, VI and VII before The last Jedi was released. Everything makes sense to me\\, I just immerse myself in the fantasy and have a great ride in the Star Wars world.","true":true}
