Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had a strong dislike for this movie.  It had some funny moments and a couple neat scenes.  Had good Special Effects.\\n\\nplotwise it did nothing for me.  \\n\\nThe chase was boring and could have been so much better.  See the Battlestar galactica reboot.\\n\\nThe Vegas Vacation was boring and pointless.  \\n\\nPoe is way too good in an x-wing vs pilots in previous movies and his x-wing seems too agile.  Just bothers me.\\n\\nThe REBEL commander was lame.  Every other rebel commander shared the plan with everyone.  She doesn't\\, creates a rebellion within her own ranks\\, blames everyone else and has a meaningless death.  Autopilot or a Droid could have done that.\\n\\nDIDn't really like Luke's story ark either.  I don't think it's true to the luke from the original trilogy.","true":true}
