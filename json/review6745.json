Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t listen to the angry fanboys. They are probably the same ones that complained that The Force Awakens was just a repeat of A New Hope\\, and now they are complaining that The Last Jedi is too different? The Last Jedi is a very good movie that looks to start a new chapter with a new group of characters\\, and I for one applaud it. Is it perfect? No. But it\u2019s highly entertaining\\, and VERY much a Star Wars movie. I can\u2019t wait to see what next in this saga\\, & look forward to seeing what Rian Johnson does next with the new trilogy in a few years! (For the record I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fan\\, and have been for 30+ years) ","true":true}
