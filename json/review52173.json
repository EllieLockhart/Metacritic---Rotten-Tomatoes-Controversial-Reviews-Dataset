Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After two and a half hours of misdirection and melodrama\\, The Last Jedi succeeds only at voiding The Force Awakens of any purpose and dooming Episode 9 to the same fate. In that\\, it fails in a way the prequels never did. This trilogy is now finished.","true":true}
