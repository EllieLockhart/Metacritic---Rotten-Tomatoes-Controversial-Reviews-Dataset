Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, it was unpredictable and exciting with surprise moments that made me exclaim aloud with joy. The humor was a welcome Treat as well and helped the tempo. I truly felt as if the director did well at representing each fan that grew up wanting to be Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
