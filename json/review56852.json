Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a lot of controversy for this one. Some thought it was crap and others thought it was good. Rotten Tomatoes have a Certified Fresh score and the audience review are in the upper forty percent. So went into this one with lowered expectations\\, which is bad because it\u2019s a Star Wars movie. I shouldn\u2019t feel that at all about a Star Wars movie\\, and after seeing The Last Jedi I really wasn\u2019t. It was the best Star Wars movie\\, but it wasn\u2019t Attack Of The Clones bad. I liked what they did with the story\\, it was thin but it worked. I liked all of the characters: Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Kyle Ren along with Luke and Leia Skywalker. I didn\u2019t like what they did with Luke\u2019s character they made him weak. If they wanted to kill him off\\, have him go out fighting and self projecting himself across the galaxy. It was my biggest gripe. And I\u2019m sure it affected the audience score on RT. My other problem was the pacing of the movie. I didn\u2019t the Finn and Rose story arc on the Casino planet. I thought it was unnecessary. But other than that\\, it was a pretty good movie. Let\u2019s hope J.J. Can tie up this new trilogy properly. ","true":true}
