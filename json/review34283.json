Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The absolute best one out of all the movies. This movie makes you think and feel and if you're not paying attention you will miss all the symbolism that makes it one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen. I will be seeing this several times before it's out of the theaters and can't wait to own it. Kudos to Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. Their paring is absolutely mesmerizing. I look forward to seeing them in the final episode.","true":true}
