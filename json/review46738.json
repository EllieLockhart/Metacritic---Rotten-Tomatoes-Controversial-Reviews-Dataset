{"101487":194397,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Welcome to Star Wars Pussy-Whipped Leftist All-Minorities-Included Edition.\\nI have read in the news that some angry Star Wars fan published an edited version of The Last Jedi without all the unnecessary feminazi\\, social justice warrior\\, vegan\\, diversity-at-all-costs nonsense... and all that remains are 40 minutes of nothing.\\nI also had the same instinct to try to save the movie by editing out the nonsense. This guy saved me time and effort. Neither of them is worth the trying. We have to admit that this movie is fucked beyond any repair.\\nThe leftist turn had already been slapped in our face through the red-dominated posters\\, which by themselves were a complete digression from the look and feel of the Star Wars franchise. The movie confirmed that it was at no point the intention of Rian Johnson to make a good Star Wars Movie. His intention was\\, and he may admit it publicly sooner or later\\, to shove in our throats tons and tons of barely concealed anti-male\\, female-supremacy\\, anti-western-civilization\\, pro-diversity-at-all-costs\\, leftist\\, anti-capitalist\\, animalist\\, vegan propaganda.\\nOne may think that he spent 99% of his time trying to conceive a way to shove all this propaganda up our asses and only 1% of the time trying to write a decent script.\\nThe result is a movie which has been correctly described as a catastrophe\\, a travesty\\, a piece of the worst kind of agit-prop propaganda.\\nBeyond that\\, on a strict cinematographic plane\\, it is full of plot holes\\, bad jokes thrown in our faces for the sake of themselves\\, unrealistic twists and subplots that add nothing to the story.\\nAnd it does not a good service to the causes Rian Johnson so desperately wanted to push: the actions of the two women\\, admiral Purple Lesbo and poor-fat-ugly-stupid-self-appointed-minority-social-animal-rights-warrior Rose were so misconceived that they put at serious risk the lives of the rebels (Rose stopping Finn from destroying the cannon\\, thus giving the First Order the possibility to wipe off the rebels) or worse they caused thousands of deaths (admiral Holdo not telling anyone her plans and subsequently hesitating way too much before finally warp-ramming Snooke's starship).\\nFreeing the animals (and not freeing the slave children!) only to have them most probably recaptured the day after by the rich-and-therefore-bad people of Canto Bight is not only useless. It is plainly stupid.\\nIs Rian Johnson a double agent of the worst right-wing white-male-supremacists? If so he did an extremely good job. Well done Rian!","true":true}
