Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie pissed me off enough to create an account here to review it.\\n\\nIf you thought the prequel trilogy damaged Star Wars\\, TLJ ruins any kind of momentum rebuilt from The Force Awakens and especially Rogue One.\\n\\nThis movie ruins old favorites\\, kills the best new character with no explanation\\, adds about an hour of filler side story with no pay off and does not take advantage of some of the interesting setups this movie had access to but did not fully develop before cutting the threads.\\n\\nYes this movie will look successful this weekend\\, but they have guaranteed that I will not see any other films related to this franchise in the theater.","true":true}
