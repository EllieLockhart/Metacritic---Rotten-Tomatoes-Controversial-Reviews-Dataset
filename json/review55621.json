Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was this the worst Star Wars movie ever made it is also one of the worst movies ever made. There is so much wrong with it I don't know where to begin. Luke was destroyed\\, Leia was turned into a bitter old female version of Patton\\, Holdo felt like if an actress tried to run the military\\, Finn was inconsequential as was Rose and Poe\\, Rey received no character development except on drug trip in a rabbit hole but somehow she's still more powerful than anyone except Snoke\\, the comedy was relentless and juvenile and all that's just the tip of the iceberg. Thanks for ruining Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill was right and I should have listened to him. Shame on Disney\\, Johnson and Kennedy. You've taken a great story and left it in ruins. Luke can never be repaired. I guess I'll just have to be glad for the other six movies\\, the cartoons and the Legends material. The only reason I give it a half star is out of respect and pity for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher that they had to be subjected to this movie. Also\\, the porgs were funny and Jonas did a good job as Chewbacca. Oh well\\, that's all I can say. Maybe J.J. can save it but I have my doubts. I don't know if anyone could save it now.","true":true}
