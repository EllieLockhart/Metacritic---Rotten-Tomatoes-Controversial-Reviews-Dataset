Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(sigh) This is at best a lesser knockoff of Empire Strikes Back. I was shaking my head through most of this movie.\\nIt isn't a disaster but it comes real close.\\nThere are some great scenes\\, the musical score is fantastic\\, Luke's story is done well. \\nAs I said before there is too much story lifted from a better movie.\\nPoe\\, Finn and Rose have no chemistry together. None.\\nI am very disappointed with this film.\\nNot much more I can say without spoiling it.\\nAbsolutely NOT looking forward to Episode 9.","true":true}
