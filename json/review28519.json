Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pro: a more original story than TFA with some definite crowd-pleasing moments.\\nCon: everything below.\\n\\n[My comments on this film necessarily include aspects of TFA that establish the mess of a story we're in now]\\n\\nTLJ begins with a Verizon commercial-esque comedy routine. The rebels proceed to act farcically for the rest of the film\\, making bad decisions\\, witholding key information from their own people\\, and never succeeding at any of their plots and plans.\\n\\nRey continues her thoroughly unexplained and unjustifiable dominance in force powers. One of my biggest objections to the rebooted films is the entirely out-of-whack \\\"force power hierarchy\\\".\\nAnakin Skywalker was literally conceived by the force\\, the most powerful jedi ever\\, but Rey with zero training can mind-trick\\, fight with a saber\\, and lift a bunch of huge rocks without really concentrating (\\\"lifting rocks then\\\"\\, she says glibly). Meanwhile Ren effectively beat Luke\\, pushing him away and crashing a building on him (leaving him for dead)\\, but Ren can't beat untrained Rey in TFA. Then Luke\\, who effectively bested Anakin (g.o.a.t) in ROTJ\\, gets bested by the untrained Rey on his island. \\nThe newer films clearly don't respect The force\\, how it's followers develop their powers\\, and its \\\"power rankings\\\" \\n\\nThen there's the overall state of the galaxy. In the previous six films we watched the fall of the republic and the rebellion struggle against the empire that replaced it. They fought long and hard to defeat the empire and destroy the emperor. \\n\\nAnd yet in TFA\\, Luke's a hermit\\, the republic has somehow totally missed the creation of this first order organization that has a cannon literally the size of a planet\\, and they\\, and all of their military might (apparently)\\, are totally destroyed. Weak. Welp\\, so much for that Republic we helped build!\\n\\nFor the sake of 'rebooting' the franchise (aka $)\\, they completely disregarded the struggle and the progress of all the characters from 1 through 6. Kylo Ren's lines about \\\"forgetting the past\\\" are exactly the philosophy Disney has for these movies. They belittle the Force. Old-as-heck Han Solo was smuggling stupid dangerous aliens??!?\\n\\nSpecific to TLJ\\, there are numerous plot and character complaints.  I liked Finn in TFA\\, but in this film he has practically nothing of use to do except lead us through a painfully pointless casino planet sequence. \\n\\nLuke's final act was pretty cool\\, but considered against the realm of possibilities for his character\\, ultimately very disappointing.  I hated that they turned him into a curmudgeon. \\nThese are not Star Wars movies to me. To me the saga ended with Return of the Jedi and I also consider in my mind the sequel novels by Timothy Zhan as far better canon than they've cooked up.\\n\\nFinally\\, I'm not one of those who objects to the film based on social justice issues.","true":true}
