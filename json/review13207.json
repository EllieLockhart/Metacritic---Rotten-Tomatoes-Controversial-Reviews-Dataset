Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t think we will fully understand this movie until the episode 9 is released. Snoke\u2019s role and Rey\u2019s parents are not answered just yet. I can guarantee that. It\u2019s visually beautiful. Would get 5 stars if 2 lights sabers would of actually touched. ","true":true}
