Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I was a professional critic\\, I presume that I would probably say something like: \\\"this movie is the greatest movie ever produced. Every second of it is perfect. There was the godfather and citizen kane in the 20th century\\, we now have the last jedi in the 21th century\\\".\\n\\nHowever\\, since I am only a necessarily brainless and angry viewer\\, I prefer to express my personal feelings on the movie as follows:\\nI have signed up and written this first and last comment on RT for the sole purpose of expressing how terrible I find this movie under every possible angles. Even the soundtrack is\\, in my opinion\\, completely inconsistent with and disrespectful of the SW universe. I fully agree with a large majority of the negative comments posted on RT. I consider this movie as being only focused on pre-teenager like hunger games (Ray and Ben Solo could easily be part of that latter movie as they are). I cannot believe that several decades of intergenerational passion for SW have been ruined in 10 quarters. And I feel lenient and opened-minded\\, as exemplified by the fact that I have easily accepted Episodes I and II with all of their flawesses.","true":true}
