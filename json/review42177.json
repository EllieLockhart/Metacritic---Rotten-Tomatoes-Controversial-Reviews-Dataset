Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie seemed like it was written and directed by someone who hates star wars.  There are so many parts where it feels like a middle finger to fans of the franchise.  So many bad choices\\, a story line that goes absolutely nowhere\\, a main plot with holes so big you can fly a star destroyer through them.  I am truly disappointed and I no longer look forward to more star wars movies.","true":true}
