Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Lacking of any story or characterization. Guessing Harrison Ford knew this was coming and why he decided to bow out in the previous film. Only positive i can say\\, is we get to see one last great performance by the late Carrie Fisher","true":true}
