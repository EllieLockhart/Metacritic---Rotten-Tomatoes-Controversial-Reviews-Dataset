Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bad film believe what you have read.. in its defense there are things that maybe could've worked if done properly\\, but executed as is it is kind of a dumpster fire. Bland unlikeable characters doing things that have no payout at the end of the film\\, and it's excessively long with all of this in mind","true":true}
