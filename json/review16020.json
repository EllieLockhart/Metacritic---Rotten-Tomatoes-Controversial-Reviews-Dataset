Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge star wars fan and like many made an account to share my feelings about the newest Star Wars film. While many in the media are attempting to attribute the negative reviews to bots or a few dedicated haters\\, that is simply not the case and quite immature. I won't give this a half star since I think that would be too harsh (it wasn't a complete and total waste) because it had some good scenes but overall I would rate this film a D or F hence the 40%. I won't bash Johnson and his work since I have never seen any of his other films\\, but he will have to prove himself again after this debacle.\\n\\nI didn't particularly like the nostalgia-milking of TFA and I thoroughly enjoyed rogue one\\, but this was far and away the worst one of both the new trilogy and the series as a whole. It simply was not a Star Wars movie\\, but rather a Disney movie\\, which is a shame. There was an unbelievable amount of missed potential (like Leia being the one to snipe the Empire's ship at light speed\\, giving her a heroic sendoff instead of some random character while they will now be forced to kill her off in an undignified manner; not to mention an unceremonious bifurcation of Snoke) and some completely and utterly useless scenes that would be best left on the cutting room floor (that stupid soap-box-heavy Finn\/Rose subplot had me squirming throughout it's entirety.) \\n\\nDon't even get me started on the obvious holiday toy cash grab that was the porgs\\, or the poorly timed comedic relief that time and again left me shaking my head in disbelief. Little to no character development\\, glaring plot holes (an insubordinate pilot becoming the leader of the entire resistance\\, come on) and a disregard for established world traditions are unforgivable in any movie. I have not been able to recommend this movie to anyone\\, and hope Episode IX gets back on the right track although I will not be seeing it in theatres until someone tells me it was at least three times better than TLJ.","true":true}
