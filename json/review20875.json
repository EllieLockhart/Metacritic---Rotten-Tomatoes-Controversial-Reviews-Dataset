Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was a die-hard Star Wars fan since I was a 6 year old child when the original Star Wars movie came out. The movie industry and Disney forget we true fans are who kept Star Wars alive. We bought all the books and merchandise and more importantly introduced and made our kids and in some cases grand children believe and love this franchise. But understand we watched this movie for one reason. We had to to support our passion. Understand this Disney I HATED this movie and you will not get another penny or my support ever again!!! You betrayed me!! But Im sure your Social justice warriors will be here for 40 years like me\\, NOT!! Good luck with that!","true":true}
