Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, not just a terrible Star Wars movie\\, a bad movie. The plot doesn't make sense\\, the characters actions don't make any sense and then when you add in the Star Wars lore\\, nothing makes sense. Even down to the fact Fin was the toilet cleaner in the force awakens who could not fly\\, flies two ships in this movie. And that is the least of my complaints\\, there may not be one scene that has any logic in it\\, I'm a huge star wars fan but this film just killed the whole franchise for me.","true":true}
