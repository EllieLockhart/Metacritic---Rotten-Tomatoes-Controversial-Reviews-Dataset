Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mess\\, many of the new characters decisions and motives make little sense\\, the immersion of the universe is distorted for plot convenience and the classical tyrannical archetype portrayed through the imperial forces are reduced to a joke. The one positive the  movie had was the chemistry between Kylo ren and Rei\\, and their team up but that\\, one decent move in a new and interesting direction was quickly wasted. Starwars is dead.","true":true}
