Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most epic\\, groundbreaking\\, and surprising Star Wars film yet! The directing by Rian Johnson is so cinematic\\, unique and breathtaking including the acting in this film by Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Jon Boyega. The writing to the film was great. The action sequences were incredible and so much fun to watch. This film is a major improvement to The Force Awakens because with The Force Awakens it basically copied off A New Hope\\, instead of making The Force Awakens be its own film. But with this film\\, it does not copy off The Empire Strikes Back. It is it's own Star Wars movie and it's just so spectacular! Kyle Ren in this movie was so much better than he was in The Force Awakens. But that is all I will say for now because Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a marvelous and unforgettable Star Wars Film\\, That people will be talking for generations.","true":true}
