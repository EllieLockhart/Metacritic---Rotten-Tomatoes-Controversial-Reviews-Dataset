{"101487":188489,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst star wars movie I ever seen! Rian Johnson it is very clear he is not a good writer and he needed a co-writer for the movie. The plot holes are uncountable\\, the editing of the movie was very bad and sloppy\\, the scene with Finn meets Rose for the first time\\, Finn is about to enter a pod he place his bag outside the pod\\, when Rose talks to him\\, some how the bag gets inside the pot but worst on top of a chair lol. This is a very bad movie. Then they killed off Luke Skywalker\\, with an unreasonable reason projecting an image of himself kills him. Then they made Luke be a person who turn his back on the Force\\, and his friends and family. This image of Luke is hard to accept it like Captain American turn his back on America and start killing American citizens. Or like Superman turn his back on Lewis\\, and leave her to die when he can save her. The Last Jedi is the far worst Star Wars movie even though it had a big budget\\, and fancy visual it writing and plot fell through the roof.  This why it has a low audience score. Then Finn in TFA Finn appeared he might be force senstive\\, why did he leave the first order what made him turn in TLJ this is ignored\\, and he was turned into a side character who did not even have no importance to the main plot. In the promotion of the Last Jedi they was showing Finn had a new blaster\\, he did not even use the blaster one time! Ouch! The Last Jedi was a lot of money invested in an non-experience  writer and director\\, they should used someone more experiences like Spielberg or Ron Howard.","true":true}
