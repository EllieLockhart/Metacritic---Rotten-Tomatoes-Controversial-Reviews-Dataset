Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a big Star Wars fan myself\\, I must admit I absolutely enjoyed the movie. Aside from the amazing visual and exotic locations\\, I also like the movie's narrative and theme about Failure and Redemption\\, which is carried out pretty consistently throughout the film. Although I did have some minor issues with it\\, which mostly stemmed from my own expectations\\, this action-packed and characters-focused movie is entertaining through and through. Hence my rating of 5\/5.","true":true}
