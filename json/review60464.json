I believe that the hate is exaggerated and it\u2019s mostly people who have read the leaks and then didn\u2019t buy the game. Trust me most people I have spoke with who avoided spoilers then played the game loved it. Personally\\, I understand the hate but I also understand why people believe it is a masterpiece. There is some pacing issues but does a lot of things very well. The combat is pretty similar to the first one but they\u2019ve added all the things you wished you could do in the first one making Ellie much more agile than Joel - kind of like an uncharted meets TLOU 1. Overall this game is a rollercoaster of emotions that will never leave you. I recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about it!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
