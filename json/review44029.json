Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TL;DR\\, this is the worst Star Wars ever made.  Don't give Disney any more money than they have already swindled out of people.  Wait to see this on Redbox for a dollar.  Disney betrayed the Star Wars fan base with this film.\\n\\nI have been a SW fan since I was kid in the 80s.  I got heavily into the EU in the 90s\\, read most of the novels (stopped at Yuuzhan Vong stories due to lack of interest)\\, I played many of the games including X-Wing\\, Tie Fighter\\, Galaxies\\, KOTOR\\, SWTOR.  \\n\\nHere is my list of issues with this movie.\\n\\n- Mary Sue lead still not dealt with effectively\\, Rey gets $h1t tier training and can do everything\\n- Identity politics message front and center\\n- Non- believable depressed Luke Skywalker (Hammill tried to stop them but they would not listen\\, look this up on Youtube)\\n- Anti-climactically off multiple main characters\\n- Unbelievable force use scene with Leia which is becoming known as the \\\"Space Mary Poppins Leia\\\"\\n- Really cringey scene on the island that involves Luke milking a sea mammal of some sort and then tasting the milk reacting like it was whiskey.\\n- Make Anti-Capitalist tirade while using capitalism making billions while destroying Star Wars\\n- Canto Bite story arc completely unnecessary\\, leads to mistakes by 3 lead characters which indirectly lead to death of hundreds\\, never elaborated on.\\n- Escape sequence takes whole movie\\, drags on and on and the reason for it is not believable and is a stretch for the tech in the SW universe.\\n- Deus ex Machina planet\\n- Phasma still sucks\\n- \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\"\\, You mean destroy our favorite character's stories and while extracting as much capital from the corpse of the franchise.","true":true}
