Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really well done film. Luke - and the Jedi in general - are given a more human face (even if he isn't the infallible space Jesus some were hoping to see)\\, Kylo and Rey both develop\\, the battles are fantastic and the characters believable.\\n\\nKylo in particular dominates this movie - well done to Adam Driver.\\n\\nThe negatives for me are fairly nit-picky. If you can ram people at light speed\\, why has it never been done? Like against the Death Star? The Pharma\/Finn confrontation lacked any impact\\, and I would liked a little more on Smoke and how he got to Kylo in the first place.","true":true}
