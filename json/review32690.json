Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is the next installment in the Star Wars franchise. Rian Johnson in my opinion had delivered one of the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back. But\\, there are flaws. There are certain things that I liked and things I don't liked. The things that I don't liked is the Finn and Rose story line. It felt like it's a complete different movie. The things that i like is the action sequences\\, Space battle and the story overall. This is a completely different Star Wars movie\\, yeah there is certain elements which is similar to the original trilogy\\, but it no big deal. Overall this is movie is a ton of fun. I had a total blast watching from start to finish.","true":true}
