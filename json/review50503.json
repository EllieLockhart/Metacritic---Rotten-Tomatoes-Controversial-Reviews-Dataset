Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1977 I saw the first Star Wars movie. I was 12. I have loved every Star Wars movie. This movie is visually beautiful. The script is garbage. For me it's the end of the franchise. I can't imagine how J.J. Abrams will redeem this with all the plot holes\\, horrible and OBVIOUS \\\"Mary Sue\\\" of Rey. I will not be paying to see the next one in theaters and this franchise has been a family tradition. It did have some really good moments\\, but far outweighed by all the bad. Wait til it comes out on DVD if you have to see it. And it hurts to say this about a SW movie. If it were a stand alone movie not connected to 40 years of history I would give it 3 stars. But this is like someone wanted a parody of Star Wars\\, not a true Star wars movie. 1\/2 star is for the visuals. I am so sad.","true":true}
