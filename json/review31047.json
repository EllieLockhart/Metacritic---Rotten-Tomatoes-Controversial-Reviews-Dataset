Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So greatly disappointing.  After 2 years of being excited to see this movie and all of the unbelievable hype ... we got another jar-jar flipper.  Why didn't they just leave it in JJ's hands????  Ugh!  I'm actually mad about it.","true":true}
