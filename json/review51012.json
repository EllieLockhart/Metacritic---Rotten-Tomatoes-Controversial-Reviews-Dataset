Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely awesome movie. I went through a range of emotions and was blown away by every part of this movie. I'm a huge fan of star wars \\, but i never go into a movie with expectations. My thought is \\, anything can happen at any time\\, with a certain point of view. This movie allows us to use our imagination and give us the power to open our minds and see what we want to see. I love movies that make us think\\, makes us feel \\, and make us want more.","true":true}
