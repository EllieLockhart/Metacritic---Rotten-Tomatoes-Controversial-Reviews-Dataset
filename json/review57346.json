Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the worst Star Wars movie of all time.  \\nAt least The Phantom Menace felt like a Star Wars movie(it was just bad).   \\nThis movie feels like a \\\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\\" fan fiction. The first exchange of dialogue in the movie is an attempt at comedy!!! A yo mama joke????? really????  \\nFinn having his spine slashed open in the previous movie is thrown out the window and is never brought up again. Leia turns into Mary Poppins.  \\nAbsolute DISRESPECT for original cast and characters.  \\nThis movie had no storyline. From the start of the movie to the end of the movie nothing has changed except for 2 characters dying. That's it.  \\nHorrible CGI. Jam packed with merchandise teases.  \\nHorrible dialogue.  \\nEvery time the scene started to have real impact\\, they destroyed the mood with a stupid joke. \\\"REACH OUT WITH YOUR FEELINGS\\\".  \\nI thought this film was marketed as \\\"a darker script\\\"!???????!?  \\nSo bad and all the reviewers are paid off.  \\nDisgraceful.","true":true}
