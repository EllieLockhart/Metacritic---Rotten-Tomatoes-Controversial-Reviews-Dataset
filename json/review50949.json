Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolute garbage\\, has lost the soul of george lucas' star wars. the disney creative team seem more interested in jamming this new trilogy with identitarian gender and race politics than creating a well thought out story\\, all the characters are tokens\\, which is exactly the outcome identity politics was trying to prevent. \\noverall poorly written. poorly paced and trashes almost all of the continuity of forty years of star wars","true":true}
