Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It makes no sense to me why this is has such a low audience rating here.  Yes\\, there are a few plot holes\\, and they're annoying\\, but it is more than made up for with some epic cinematics and solid new additions to the force mythos (no midichlorians).  I still prefer Empire\\, A New Hope\\, and even Rogue One to Last Jedi\\, but it's still far and above a better movie than any of the prequels\\, and on par with ROTJ.","true":true}
