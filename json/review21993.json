Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"just the worst movie ever\\, killing the star wars franchise for me.  Threw out well established charActers\\, themes and lore for a politically coRrect narrative that overtOok the story\\, so heavy handed in its approach as to make it bitter To swallow.  Strong characters and plot is what we need and After thaT\\, then make them whatever sex and orientation you like.  \\n\\nmisplaced and jarring humour and complete diSregard for the plot points set up in \\\"the force awakenS\\\"\\, a movie i actually enjoyed.  I haD no issues with the character and set up here but the same under ruIn Johnson created a tErrible movie. \\n\\nI'll stick with the first six movIes from now.  Star wars is otherwise finished for me.","true":true}
