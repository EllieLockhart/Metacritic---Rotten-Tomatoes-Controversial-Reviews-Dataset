Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The past doesn't matter\\\" and \\\"This isn't going to go the way you think\\\" was Disney's warning to fans that they were going to take a massive dump on legacy of the original trilogy. \\nWhat you do have to wonder though is if the unsubtle misandrist message had been toned down a tad (Instead of smashing us over the head with it) we might have had a better movie\\, AND the SJW liberals would have still got their virtue signalling agenda across a little more under the radar. As it is this movie has the distinction of being worse that Phantom Menace\\, and due to the backlash\\, setting back the cause of feminism by years.","true":true}
