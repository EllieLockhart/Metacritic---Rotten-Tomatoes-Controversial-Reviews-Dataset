Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson unfortunately was very overindulgent with the story. He wanted to tell a story that was episode 5 and 6 combined and left next to nothing for JJ Abrams. Also why is Fin leaving Rey for another girl. The dynamic was already build between them and now in a matter hours he has somehow fallen in love with someone else. There were a few interesting points to the movie\\, but unfortunately this movie has ruined something that many have waited to see for 30 years. After watching the prequels again beside some bad dialogue I know understand why Mark Hamhill wished they had consulted with George Lucas more. Shame. Shame. Shame. I am sorry Rian\\, Fail.","true":true}
