Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a remake or rewrite of a New Hope. It changed the characters and some of the plot\\, but the story was more or less the same. It was always very well made and fun to watch\\, just like the first movie (although now dubbed Episode IV). So\\, is the The Last Jedi a remake and rewrite of The Empire Strikes back? Yes\\, and no. Yes\\, it very much is a rewrite in exactly the same way\\, and just as The Empire significantly improved upon A New Hope\\, so does The Last Jedi upon The Force. No\\, because it ALSO includes a rewrite of most of the story for The Return of the Jedi\\, which was a bit unexpected. What is left for the final movie to wrap up is for Kylo Ren to turn good again and sacrifice himself and become Ben Solo again\\, which will happen towards of the next movie most likely. Lets see if I am right in two years time\\, I am sure I am. \\nOtherwise it is unusually long\\, which is great\\, the more the merrier\\, with lots of fun Star Wars action\\, nice costumes and hair\\, cute and ugly animals\\, all of which is available for purchase at your local Disney store. Enjoy the ride.","true":true}
