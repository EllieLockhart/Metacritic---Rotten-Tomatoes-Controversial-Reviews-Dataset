Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so many plot holes...so many bad decisions (that would've been good if saved for the trilogy finale)...displaced awkward comedy...so much wasted time...this director saw a chance to make a name for himself by \\\"burning SW to the ground\\\" and disregarded everything & everyone else to do so. The Force Awakens was a SW movie made by a SW fan for everyone...Rogue One was a SW movie made by a SW fan for SW fans...The Last Jedi was a SW movie made by someone who cared more about himself than SW or SW fans or anyone else.","true":true}
