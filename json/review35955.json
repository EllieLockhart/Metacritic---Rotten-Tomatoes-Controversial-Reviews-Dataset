Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi manages to forgo every plot thread established in the last installment for some kind of tonally misappropriated millennial tripe. Not only does it cease to develop any of the characters\\, but actually manages to undo any progression from the previous film (I'm looking at you Po\\, Finn and Rey). It is painfully obvious that these movies are being developed as standalone half-baked films instead of chapters in a cohesive framework.","true":true}
