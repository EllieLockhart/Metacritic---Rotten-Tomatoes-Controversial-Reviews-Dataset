Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS. Shouldn't have listened to all the hype (and critic's reviews) as this created unrealistic expectations. Was certainly good\\, but expected much much more. Some surprises were great\\, others too obvious or not designed\/divulged very well so lost punch or impact intended (that could have easily been achieved). Jokes - some funny\\, subtle\\, and well timed\\, while others far too forced\/corny - seemed too much an attempt to duplicate those created almost effortlessly by JJ Abrams. Also\\, some characters were seemingly fit into story without any need or value simply for air time. Similarly\\, some of the \\\"drama\\\" was overdone and pointless\\, just for effect rather than meaningful or relevant storytelling. Can't wait for next installment to get back on track as left room for JJ to once again save the day and bring the story to close.","true":true}
