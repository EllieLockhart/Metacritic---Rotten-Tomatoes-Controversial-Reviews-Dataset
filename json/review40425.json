Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best Star Wars movie I have watched till date. It is not only ingenious\\, loaded with symbolism\\, great character arcs\\, beautiful action\\, and hilarious comic time\\, it also contains heart and resolve which is central to a movie which stand high on the expectations of its audience. Loved this movie. In love with Daisy Ridley all over again.\\n\\nP.S : Just don't watch it in 3D","true":true}
