The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Despite the game being significantly leaked a month before its release and the review bombing on this website\\, I still kept my preorder and received it on day one. With over 10 hours put into the game so far I can say that it is absolutely amazing\\, and a very addicting title. Let me break this down into an organized way. Graphics are up first\\, and boy are they amazing\\, especially the lighting. Oh my god\\, the lighting is beautiful\\, especially on the base ps4. The rest of the game is spectacular too\\, especially when you get to the second day of Seattle\\, the wildlife is awe dropping\\, and i have taken several screenshots because I am so amazed. Next up is sound\\, and it is very much similar if not better than that of the first title. Gameplay: a lot of aspects are taken from the first game and blended perfectly with elements from this title. Aspects from the first game are approved upon\\, and the addition of prone mode allows for the stealth aspect\\, arguably one of the most important ones\\, really prominent and amazing.\r\rStory so far: Ok\\, so Joel dies\\, I've known that since the unfortunate leaks and jerks on the internet. Man\\, this scene was intense\\, very gruesome\\, I had goosebumps and was speechless. The death was surprising but isn't really shocking given the context o the story and the events from the previous title.\r\rCharacters: Dina is someone that I thought would be the 'annoying one'\\, in the sense of always being cute and flirty with Ellie\\, but she is actually a useless and nice addition to the story line.. except when we find out she's pregnant. The way it was implemented into the story was kinda random and sorta poor writing in my opinion. The flashbacks from a few years ago with Ellie and Tommy\/Joel is also a nice addition\\, especially for Tommy\\, a very under developed character in the context of the first game. Jesse is also a nice character that I fully expected to have beef with Ellie dating his former GF\\, but he doesn't\\, and respects their relationship\\, which makes his character that much more enjoyable.\r\rWeapons: The weapons system is 100 times better in this game than the first one. As opposed to getting the best weapons towards the end of the game\\, you are able to get really good ones pretty early on in parts of Seattle\\, making taking out enemies\\, especially the shamblers\\, much more easy and enjoyable.\r\rWorkbench: a really stupid thing for me to go crazy over but I really enjoy the overall improvements and designs of the workbench\\, and being able to see your character actually upgrade and change parts of the weapon\\, as opposed to the lazy\\, fixed camera that most developers will have in titles.\r\rSo good job\\, Naughty Dog\\, this is an excellent title so far\\, and I highly recommend people to play it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
