Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big Star Wars fan I was very disappointed in that movie. Most of the characters felt bland\\, the story was boring. The death of snoke was lame af\\, and as villain he was childish and very disappointing with zero back story. But the worst part was how this movie felt like a caricature of star wars with some cheesy ass jokes every 2 sec and some force morals like ''dont hurt the animals'' and ''dont eat the cute one''. And some very awkward and misplace kissing scene. Over all the film felt like a big and sad joke for the fans.","true":true}
