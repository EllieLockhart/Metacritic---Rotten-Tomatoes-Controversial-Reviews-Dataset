Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a travesty\\, an abomination not worthy of illegal streaming.  It's like if garbage vomited on garbage.  What do you do?  You just leave and don't even revisit the franchise from this point onward.  As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I am boycotting episode 9 for the simple reason that I don't want to add more insult to injury.   You had one job Rian\\, one job\\, to follow the set out storyline from 7 other movies\\, and you had to try to reinvent the wheel near the end!  When people look up \\\"corporate whore\\\" in a dictionary\\, your face should get a full page.","true":true}
