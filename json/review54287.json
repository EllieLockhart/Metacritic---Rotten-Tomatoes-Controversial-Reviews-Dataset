Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to watch it twice due to a projector issue the first time through.  So the second time I got past some of the knee jerk reactions I had with flying Leia\\, and force Skype.    The second time through I actually appreciated the way they somewhat humanized Kylo Ren.   And the combo fight scene against Snoke's guards was incredible.   I only think it would have been better if she had said yes and joined him as more of an attempted to save her friends by making thier safety part of her terms to joining.  I took one star away as I did not like the casino scene or the JD character.  The casino scenes took up too much precious time.","true":true}
