Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw the movie. Had some decent scenes that are enjopyable\\, but there are a lot of divisive moments in the movie. However\\, the thing that made the movie not really worth watching for me is this: why take the middle movie in a trilogy to completely dismantle the movies that came before it. If he wanted to tell a new story\\, save it for his own trilogy that he's supposed to get. Rian Johnson has not only created a mediocre movie at best\\, but has also simultaneously destroyed most of the story arcs from The Force Awakens\\, and left Episode IX dead-in-the-water storyline-wise.","true":true}
