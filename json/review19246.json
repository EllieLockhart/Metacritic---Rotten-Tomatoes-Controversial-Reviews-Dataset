Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's not a matter of equality\\, it's dumb to complain because a character is Chinese or black\\, that's just dumb. The movie is bad\\, horrible antagonists\\, very\\, but VERY banal\\, the choice they did were dumb\\, and every twist was expected\\, and when unexpected in the wrong way. Rey\\, who was an amazing character in the previous movie\\, now is just a doll extra character\\, veery disappointed","true":true}
