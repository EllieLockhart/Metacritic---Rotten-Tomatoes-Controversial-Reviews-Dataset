Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars and myself have had a troubled relationship\\, with ups and downs\\, times filled with hope\\, and also by despair. I fear this may be the last time i drag myself to a Star wars movie in hope.\\n People have commented that fan boys such as myself hate the movie because of strong female characters\\, but the reality is\\, that it doesnt matter whether the lead is female or not. Sigourney Weaver in Alien\\, Linda Hamilton in Terminator\\, Charlize Theron in Mad Max Fury Road\\, all great actors\\, all great characters\\, and all great movies that i go back to time and time again. I wont lie\\, and say i wasn't dissapointed in not seeing some of my favourite characters kick some ass and make a difference. Namely that some random chick with purple hair\\, an unknown that has no connection to the audience\\, saves the rebellion by kamikaze into the enemy fleet. Why her\\, when Ackbar\\, one of the most iconic characters of the entire franchise\\, dies in the scene before\\, and only warrents a fleeting reference about his death. Surely his death in that instance would have been so much more dramatic and memorable. \\nAlso\\, surely in this day and age\\, it is recognized that the villans are just as important\\, if not more so\\, than the protaginists? Think Heath Ledger in Batman. This movie falls far short in this department\\, with all of the First Order officers weak\\, ineffectual\\, and incompetant\\, its actually cringe worthy. Snokes death is meaningless\\, and disappointing as\\, it turns out he is not really very powerful at all\\, or very intelligent for that matter when it comes to the means of his death. And Kylo Ren is scared of his own shadow\\, and hides more often than not. Its hard to be satified when an enemy like this is defeated.\\nIn the original trilogy\\, lucas tried to bring some realism to the star wars universe\\, it was gritty\\, used...... dirty\\, and you could believe it was real. The charcters acted in a way that was believable. And yes\\, Luke was a whiney little brat\\, but he was treated with a certain contempt from the other characters because of it. Han Solo was a cold blooded killer with no fear\\, and no speaches on morality\\, he just got on with what he had to do\\, like most people do\\, instead of standing on their moral soap box every 5 minutes.\\nI wish the people who enjoyed this movie the best of luck in their continuing journey forward with the Star wars franchise\\, unfortunately\\, after 30 years\\, this is where i get off.","true":true}
