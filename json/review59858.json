Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Hmm...Where should I start... I preodered the game at first day of preoder-openning. I started the game at 0:00 19th. I completed it in 4 days. And I should say that it was quite the expirience.\rI rated The game by 4 out of 10\\, I really like 4\/10 of this game.  You may say\\, I loved it. Gameplay\\, graphics\\, all of it worked greatly with immersion\\, with empathy for Ellie. I went in this crusade for revenge. But\\, when somebody made you play as the most hateful charecter in the game\\, and somebody tried to manipulate you to love her\\, then I just snapped\\, all gameplay went to abyss of unpleasant time consuming event.\rAnd I was stunned how much of game perception depended of empathy for character. And that's why I write this review.\rI think\\, that making Abbie\/Lev pair an analog of Joel\/Ellie pair is not that good of an idea. Becouse Abbie killed Joel\\, Jessie\\, almost killed pregnant Dina (not by accident by the way)\\, and all of it opposed to heartfull relationships of player with Joel\/Ellie.\rAnd result of this poor plot choice is hours of gameplay\\, I hardly crawled through. May be story of itself is great\\, characters arcs\\, redemption\\, even representation is here\\, but that didn't work for me couse of existence of the first game. Funny fact that LoU2 would not work without first game either.\rSo I really wanted just tell that when you're making the game so mush immersive on already existed fanbase\\, you should understand what players want more: deep dramatic story or justice for their beloved characters.\rI am for the lattest.\rP.S. My first public review ever) Just wanted to share my thoughts.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
