Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With Force Awakens\\, JJ pitched a soft ball for Rian Johnson to follow up. While not terribly original\\, it was a great start with likeable new characters. \\n\\nBut Johnson took all the potential and produced.... pure unadaulterated garbage!  Do not waste your hard earned cash on this trash!","true":true}
