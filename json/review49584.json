Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. \\nBad storytelling at its best. \\nThis movies bad storyline makes the prequels bad dialogue look good. You would think with a movie as big as star wars they would put more  effort into writing a cohesive story. It is sad they allowed this movie to happen.","true":true}
