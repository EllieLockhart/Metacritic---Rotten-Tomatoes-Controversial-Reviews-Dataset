Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's honestly not as bad as people made it out to be. There are controversial decisions for sure but if anything it would allow for a third movie to be very interesting.\\n\\nPlus this movie has one of the best cinematography in a Star Wars movie EVER.","true":true}
