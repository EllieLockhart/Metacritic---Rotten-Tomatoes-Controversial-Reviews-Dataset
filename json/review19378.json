Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really hard to understand why critics rated that movie so much higher than the fans. That movie was long and not really going anywhere. None of main characters have any charisma. It doesn't take long that you just wish the movie to be over.","true":true}
