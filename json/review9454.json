Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Go in with a black mind\\, and don't go with all the pre-hype everyone was building up. Its a very good movie.Yes it takes the story in new directions and there are callbacks to the originals but i mean its star wars\\, theres always been recurring themes and motifs in the movies. Rian Johnson takes some and twists it around.","true":true}
