Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Multiple climaxes\\, should have ended with the first one. Why bring back Luke Skywalker to simply drag him through the mud\\, ruin him as a character\\, and then throw him in the garbage?\\n\\nWTF is the point now of the next film? Disney should apologize. Do some re-shoots\\, re-cut\\, and re-release this. Just pull a mulligan. Ugh.","true":true}
