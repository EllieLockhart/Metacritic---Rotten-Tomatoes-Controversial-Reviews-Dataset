Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie to the Star Wars universe. It\u2019s a shame that people are against the movie for what either EA did with Battlefront or have a smear agenda. Someone on here even used OJ Simpson in an analogy. Great movie I was excited the whole time. ","true":true}
