Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie as I watched it\\, as the visuals are incredible\\, but in the light of day as I think back\\, The Last Jedi just wasn't good. At all. The story arcs are convoluted\\, are unsatisfying\\, and don't fit together well. The dialogue seems sophomoric. TFA set up interesting characters that could be explored\\, but this movie does very to little to make me care about their journeys. We don't sympathize with their decisions. They don't connect with the audience. I appreciate the directors attempt to explore The Force in new ways but this again was uninteresting\\, unsatisfying\\, and did very little to movie the story along. On top of everything else there were some giant holes in the plot. This was a giant fail in my book.","true":true}
