Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's coherent and fun in terms of raw conflict\\, but totally squanders all the potential for a respectable storyline. It's pretty obvious that the script valued misdirection more than continuity of purpose or depth of character. This new \\\"trilogy\\\" is in desperate need of a bold direction and dare I say a Hans-like charisma. While the story clearly has a coherent trajectory\\, many good performances\\, and balance of drama and action\\, the CGI is far too dull in all the wrong places\\, and nearly every character besides Rey appears to be totally and utterly worthless to Disney. For example\\, I wasn't sure what to think about the kamikaze-like sacrifice of the Resistance's Mothership into a cartoonish-looking First Order ship\\, or the comic-book like depiction of Maz Kanata in a website-like modal\\, or the unadorned and sadly two-dimensional throne room of Snoke\\, and especially the uninspiring way in which Snoke is deposed. It's equally odd that both Fin and Poe's characters are reduced to inconsequential roles\\, and simply heretical to reduce both Luke and Leia to sweet and sour\\, cartoonish personalities with only Wizard of Oz-like instincts. Thus count me in as yet another disappointed Star Wars \\\"kid\\\"\\, who grew up with the George Lucas classics.","true":true}
