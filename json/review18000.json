Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"I think the hero's journey of Luke Skywalker concluded in 'Return of the Jedi.' This [trilogy] is the hero's journey of Rey\\, and Finn\\, and Poe\\,\\\" Johnson said. \\\"The [ongoing] story of Luke is one that has to play in tandem with that of Rey.\\\" Rian Johnson.\\n\\nHad Rian said this one week before the movie came out it wouldn't have made enough to break even. Utter failure. The entire STAR WARS religion\\, philosophy\\, lore was obliterated...all for the purpose of advancing a political agenda. Disney will wish they had reviewed this one before they approved it. There will be financial backlash as we are already seeing with it flopping totally in China!","true":true}
