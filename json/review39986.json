Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is how you destroyed Skywalker Saga... with a movie that the main line is ridiculous \u201cHow to stop the first order from tracking us in light speed\u201d And even worse they didn\u2019t get it! Luke... was unforgivable what they do to this character. ","true":true}
