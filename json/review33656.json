Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible mess of a film.   Boring nonsensical garbage.   Rian did a fine job of ruining Star Wars\\, I can't believe Disney would be dumb enough to give him 3 more.   He doesn't understand a thing about Star Wars or the characters within them.","true":true}
