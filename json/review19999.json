Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great for a normal movie but for a Star Wars movie only good. But I can see the dillemma of the filmmakers trying to bridge the old and the new. But still some scenes were taken verbatim from the old Movies. Again\\, great movie but the real \\\"Star Wars feeling\\\" was missing.","true":true}
