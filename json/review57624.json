Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long \\, could have done with scenes that didn\u2019t add anything removed. Didn\u2019t warm to new characters \\, too much time spent on island. Rebels being chased and can\u2019t get away \\, then they go to a Casino\\, ride about on big goats and come back ? Leia flys around in a vacuum then bangs on the air lock ! But good battle scenes \\, with Rey still great ","true":true}
