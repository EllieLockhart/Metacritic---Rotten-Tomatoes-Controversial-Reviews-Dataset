The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Graphics were incredible\\, beautiful scenery\\, animations\\, etc and really good gameplay. But\\, those aspects alone can't make a good game. The story was lacking\\, a big hit to a story-based game. The character development was somewhere on a scale of bland to nonexistent. The only new character I somewhat enjoyed was Dina although even she didn't have much of a personality aside from existing to be Ellie's relief. I wish they had given the side characters as much thought and development as Tess or Bill. Abby's motives were understandable but her story seemed forced and left no real room for empathy. (Her story would have been better executed if we played as her for the entire game and actually built a relationship with her and her father\\, even if it led up to Joel's death\\, or a choice to kill him at the end - anything would have been better than the story they gave us.) After the entire story played out\\, we were met with an unfulfilling ending. If Joel's death and him being spit on wasn't enough\\, Ellie lost her fingers and overall ability to carry on his legacy. I can only assume this was Naughty Dog's way of saying \\\"That's it. The game you loved is now dead. Hope you enjoyed. Thanks for the 60 bucks.\\\" It just felt like the story was written by a person who hated the first game\\, I'm not even sure if it was written by the same people because it's so one-dimensional. Overall\\, 3 out of 10 because again\\, the graphics and gameplay are nothing compared to the story. If a game was made with stick figures but had an amazing story\\, it would get a 10\/10 from me\\, this game has no excuse.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
