Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"What a fantastic game with amazing graphics\\, voice acting\\, gameplay and characters. I felt each character was interesting and while at first I hated Abby and her friends\\, the more I played as her\\, the more I grew to like her as a character. (I won\u2019t lie though\\, during the fight in the theatre between her and Ellie I was rooting for Ellie to kick Abby\u2019s ass.) There are some aspects of this game that I would personally change\\, but the few things I have problems with don\u2019t affect how I feel about the outcome of the game. I don\u2019t mind that Ellie decided to let her go. Obviously everyone\u2019s opinions are their own\\, but this is a game you need to play with an open mind and with empathy for a character we immediately learn to hate. Abby doesn\u2019t have to be our favorite character (she\u2019s definitely not mine)\\, but she has suffered with loss as well and to write her off as nothing more than a mustache-twirling villain would be wrong. You don\u2019t necessarily have to love the story to enjoy the gameplay. This game was so much fun to explore and I urge everyone to play it to completion with an open mind to gather your own thoughts on how you felt about the experience. I personally will be playing it again because I already know there are things I\u2019ve missed on my first play through. The new characters are so enjoyable. I love Dina\\, Jesse\\, Yara\\, Lev\\, and even Manny managed to grow on me. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Owen or Mel\\, but I still felt for them. I also loved reading through Ellie\u2019s journal! It was such a nice touch that gave us insight on her thoughts and feelings\\, especially since she has grown to become more quiet and reserved as a character. The scenery was breathtaking. I loved riding around on Shimmer (RIP Shimmer) and taking in the surroundings. The overgrown plant life and desolated buildings were so cool to explore. I also thoroughly enjoyed descending that huge building as Abby when we are with Lev. The infected are pretty great. The Stalkers were unnerving\\, as were the infected that just decided to pop out of the walls for no good reason other than to make my life harder than it needs to be. The Shamblers sucked\\, but just because they scared the **** out of me. The Rat King had me yelling and making rounds on that hospital floor like a big baby. By the end of that encounter I was just wishing for some good old fashioned Clickers. As for my final thoughts: this game was beautifully done overall. I wish we got more time with Ellie but I understand why we didn\u2019t. I\u2019m crossing my fingers for a DLC or a potential third game. I hope you get the chance to enjoy the game for yourself! Endure and survive\\, everyone.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
