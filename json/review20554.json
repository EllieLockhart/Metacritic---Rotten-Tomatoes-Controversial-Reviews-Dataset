Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been genuinely angry at a movie until now. Bad movies are badly written or made but this is almost sacrilegious. The Star Wars universe\\, characters and backstory that we've learned to love is ruined by effin Rian Johnson. Some really unnecessary and stupid scenes are really out of place e.g the steam iron scene - like it was stolen from Mel Brooks Spaceballs.","true":true}
