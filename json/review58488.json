Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A movie too far far away from the essence of the world created by George Lucas and enhanced by many others.  Undoes too much of what the excellent middle (IV-VI) movies accomplished by reducing the republic to ruins (much like Aliens III did to the first two Alien entries)\\, so will be little liked by fans.  Exceptionally bad science (bombs don't \\\"drop\\\" without gravity\\, dragging a \\\"foot\\\" on the ground does not improve preformance).  Republic troops reduced to near rags except Laura Dern who command with an evening gown.  Evoke man scenes from Empire but always lesser versions.  Walker v. Rebels battle done much better in Empire - why call back to a great sequence and than produce a far inferior version?  Humor forced and much less organic to characters.  Empire officers made into buffons.  Got more interesting performance from virtual Tarkin in last film.   And why did we bother with Snoke? Got to 21\/2 only due to some great acting esp. Mark Hamill as grizzled Luke.   Worried for next installment - are we going to wait for kid with broom to grow up and lead new rebellion?","true":true}
