Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Production quality was excellent\\, but the story line and dialogue left much to be wanted.  \\n\\nThe movie was long\\, and - spoiler alert - the whole sub story of the hacker\\, casino\\, jail\\, and race creatures was not only unnecessary\\, but completely unbelievable\\, and took away pacing from what was supposed to be a time-factored tension. \\n\\nThe middle of this movie sagged\\, and the Rose character was dull and unnecessary.  \\n\\nLuke's island scene carried on in redundant style\\, and didn't fit his character at all.  \\n\\nAlso\\, what was with the modern day cussing?  Calling someone banta-breath or nerf-herder was much more clever.  \\n\\nIt's in a Star Wars Universe\\, and looks and sounds amazing\\, per usual.  But the script sucked.  The editing dragged\\, and the subplots were entirely unnecessary.  It's a shame this movie will make millions of dollars.  It belongs in the scrap heap.","true":true}
