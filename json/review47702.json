Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When i heard the reasons people give to hate the movie i was surprised.\\nIn the original trilogy there were things that weren't good and that's normal.\\nThe Kylo Ren scene = Slave Leia\\nThe Snoke death = Palpatine death\\nThe film being about a ship chase = A Death star that can be destroyed by one shot \\nThere are flaws like in every movie but that doesn't mean it isn't good.If you want to hate something you'll always find a something that you can't agree with.\\nI personally think the film was great.","true":true}
