Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many connections back to both the classics as well as the newer movies that have come just before TLJ. Being a middle film this is limited with not being either the introduction of or conclusion to a full story. But the moral of the story here is that the characters grow through their failures. Each has their own little struggles that they fail at\\, and by doing so they learn more about the world and themselves.","true":true}
