Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actually really good despite what naysayers were complaining about. Worth seeing and owning. The way some characters act seems off until you remember a 20yr old person changes over their life because of choices and experiences\\, no one is the same person at the end of their life. This is every bit as good as the entire series. Don\u2019t sell it short","true":true}
