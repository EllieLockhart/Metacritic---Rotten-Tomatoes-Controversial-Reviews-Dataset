Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thankfully\\, this is not a reboot of V\\, like VII was to IV. Instead it actually has its own storyline (which is actually pretty good). The character and story development is interesting\\, with twists and turns. Still not a perfect Star Wars film\\, but it's a vast improvement on VII.","true":true}
