Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the hate is unwarranted. Like Empire with the bad reviews at the beginning\\, this will begin to be viewed as one of the best Star Wars movies in a decade. Still a great movie now.","true":true}
