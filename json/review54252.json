Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want something to switch off to and something that will entertain you with pretty visuals and the odd joke then this may be the film for you. If you want one with a half decent story and characters who actually act as though they know what they're supposed to be doing\\, then don't watch this film. I watched this and at first I thought it was ok but I looked back on it and I've come to realise that Rian Johnson has acted to destroy every single plot point that JJ Abrams set up in the previous film. I hope somehow this film ends up being 'just a dream' or is just deleted from canon because there is no way that this ties in with the last film. On top of this characters seem to take the most stupid form of action possible at any opportunity. The tension is lacklustre and drags like a crippled man dragging his broken legs across the floor. The casino subplot makes about as much sense as it would for them to suddenly go crab fishing in the middle of the film. The political message wasn't lost on me but there are better ways to get it across. It seemed again as though it was shoehorned in. I think that the last time we saw messages so blatant was Vietnam. Also rather ironic from Disney given that they profit from the poor more than anyone of us who went to see the film.","true":true}
