Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh\\, thrilling\\, twisting experience that plays with new ideas while still bringing the epic feel of the classic space saga. For those who leached on to their own theories and expectations going in\\, they'll always be disappointed... that is\\, unless they come true. If you open your mind to new possibilities in the universe\\, you'll find this a very good time. The Last Jedi is proof that Star Wars fans will never be truly satisfied and don't know what they want. If the movie is too different they will complain that it is nothing like the original trilogy. If it is more like them\\, they will say it is too close to the originals. As an avid Star Wars fan\\, I enjoyed this movie tremendously. It did however\\, have its flaws\\, just like every Star Wars movie... but flaws have always been there and are what help this franchise be great.","true":true}
