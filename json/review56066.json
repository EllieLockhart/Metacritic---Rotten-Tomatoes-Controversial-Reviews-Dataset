Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some great reviews here so not much to add.  I think one of the worst things for the film were the very misleading previews.  They did nothing to get you hyped up for what was to come.  The first order still makes no sense.  Where was the years of peace that Luke mentions in this film?   Why was the republic never rebuilt to bring freedom back to the galaxy?   Yeah.. This movie would have been better if The Force Awakens hadn't been a remake of episode 4 but I do think there were some great moments that allowed for a fresh start in movie 3.  My hope is that 3 will open the doors to something even better.","true":true}
