Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor didn't feel true to the Star Wars universe\\, force abilities are way overblown\\, the characters didn't feel true to themselves (Luke? WHY?)\\, and the movie just ran on endlessly with no real plot. Some parts were cool though.","true":true}
