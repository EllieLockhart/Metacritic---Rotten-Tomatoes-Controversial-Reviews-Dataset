Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took me an entire year to really understand what I hated about it. The plot holes\\, empty characters\\, uninspired set design and disinterest in the overall lore are one thing; but the true flaw is how I sat for two and a half hours waiting for anything to happen. I waited for something to pay off. Nothing in this film is worth waiting for. This is the episode you say \\\"not worth it\\\" The number of missed opportunities this film has is uncountable. I gave one full star only because it does have one fantastic scene with R2D2. That is it.","true":true}
