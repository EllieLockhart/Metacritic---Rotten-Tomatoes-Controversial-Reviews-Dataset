{"101487":157920,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not quite sure which movie the critics watched\\, but The Last Jedi was for me one of the biggest disappointments of 2017. It's a dumb move that disguises itself as a smart one. The entire storyline felt messy\\, the cringe-worthy meta humour made it look more like Spaceballs than a Star Wars movie that takes itself seriously and none of the 'shocking twists' that were announced before the release felt really shocking or surprising. I agree with the YouTube channel RedLetterMedia... this is 'Wheel Spinning - The Movie'. Despite all the possibilities the filmmakers had at their disposal\\, almost nothing really changes in the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson manages to create a little detour throughout the 152 minutes run time\\, but we're still back to the old light side vs dark side force users and rebellion vs empire when the closing credits roll. Let's hope J.J. Abrams can somehow fix this mess in Episode 9.","true":true}
