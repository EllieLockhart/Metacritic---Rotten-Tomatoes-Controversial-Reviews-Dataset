{"101487":196103,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the theater\\, I was really on the fence about this film.  It wasn't a bad film\\, production quality was high\\, but it left me with a burrs in my mind that took me some time to sort through.\\n\\nThere were some major story elements that were absurd.  Suspension of disbelief for the sake of the story on occasion is one thing\\, but when the film has so many obvious\\, poorly thought out plot items it's hard to swallow.\\n\\nThere were also a number of physics violations or oversights.  One or two of these would be fine\\, but it definitely puts you in a poor frame of mind when one of them is at the very start of the film (bomb bay doors open to space where people are exposed\\, also bombs falling down in space\\, etc).  There is a scene with Leia that not only requires major suspension of disbelief\\, but a tremendous amount of personal effort in order to justify the event.\\n\\nThe humor felt wrong.  It felt like the movie was trying for a Marvel style of humor\\, which has never belonged to the Star Wars universe and is following a trend right now of films in general trying to be funnier.  It might have worked had the jokes not been overdone\\, but as it was it just felt out of place.  Two examples come to mind immediately; the first was the joke about the admiral on the bridge when Poe Dameron stalls for time.  Funny initially\\, but too drawn out.  The same was true in the scene where Chewbacca cooks the Porg; initially funny\\, but when it drags on with the Porg making \\\"Bambi eyes\\,\\\" the laughter bubbled off and stewed into exasperation.\\n\\n*Spoilers follow.*\\n\\nI took umbrage with the film's storytelling priorities.  Too much time was spent on the casino thread\\, for starters.  I'm all in favor of stories having plot lines and plans that don't work out\\, but this one felt terribly contrived.  They leave their convoy\\, go to a giant casino city to find the one guy in the universe who can do what they need\\, then they get arrested for essentially a parking violation.  Contrived.  Then\\, despite not being able to talk to Mr McGuffin\\, they just happen to get thrown in a cell with some guy who can also do the thing that they need.  Contrived.  Then there is a preposterous scene where the crew frees the space horses and they race through the casino in order to dramatically escape.\\n\\nThey spent all that time on the storyline to find this person\\, and comparatively little on the Jedi thread in which Luke and Rey interact.  It started well enough\\, we get a feeling of Luke as an old cynic\\, we slowly start learning about some of the history\\, an interesting foundation is established.  However\\, by the time Luke agrees to train her\\, she has one real lesson and just sort of leaves.  She has no training\\, she barely spent any time with Luke and yet the end of the film implies that she's a Jedi.  Of course I'm oversimplifying but I found it terribly obnoxious.\\n\\nAll this time was spent on an absurd story about a casino city which felt like it existed just because they wanted to have something for those characters to do\\, and the trade-off was that we get to see less of Luke and Rey\\, nothing of the history of Snoke and Kylo Ren besides a mere mention\\, and very little extrapolation on the whole \\\"last Jedi\\\" motif.\\n\\nOne story point that I found to be excellent was the elimination of Snoke towards the end of the film.  It happened in a fairly predictable manner\\, but it was a surprising happening in this film and not the third film.  The whole throne-room scene was well done and very fitting.  I wish more of the film had been like that.\\n\\nThe other story point that must be discussed is the final\\, most important detail.  Going into the film\\, it felt like Luke Skywalker's death was inevitable; generally speaking\\, it's a bad thing for a film when a character's fate feels pre-determined\\, unless the filmmakers can upset or surpass expectations.  The setup was right\\, it had a very \\\"Ben Kenobi\\\" feel to it\\, and in the end we learn that Luke wasn't there at all\\, he had simply been projecting himself through meditation and communion with the Force.  It was wonderfully surprising\\, a brilliant way to present Luke's stand and escape what had seemed to be inevitable.  But wait... Luke just disappeared out from under his cloak\\, like Yoda under the blankets; he's gone.  They took that stroke of brilliance and just threw it away\\, dropping right back into the rut of inevitability.\\n\\n*Spoilers end.*\\n\\nIt wasn't all bad.\\n\\nThere were layers of conflict - internal and external conflict\\, conflicting roles\\, conflicts of interest - woven among many different characters.  This turned out pretty well\\, even if some of the methods of portrayal and the resolutions offered felt unsatisfactory.  Some of the conflicts and self-doubt and questioning felt as though they were written for children - and perhaps they were - so they left something to be desired on a more profound philosophical level.  It would have been very intriguing had the story addressed more of the history of Snoke\\, Kylo Ren and Skywalker; there was a perfect setup for addressing some of those motifs with Rey as well.  However\\, as it was the story just felt like it skimmed the surface instead of plumbing the depths and came across as banal and trite as a result\\, instead of sharp and insightful.\\n\\nThe production and technical aspects of the film were tremendous.  It felt pretty cleared that production spared no expense in putting the film together.  It was a very pretty film and in that regard it was a pleasure to behold.  Particularly in the initial space battle\\, the action felt like Star Wars and was well-constructed and immersive (at least until the whole bomb bay doors\/kicking the ladder thing).  The production of the film cannot be gainsaid.\\n\\nThe acting performances were\\, on a whole\\, superior to the prior film.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver in particular stood out as improved performances.  Mark Hamill was terrific.  All of the actors seemed to feel their characters well\\, and with the exception of Benecio Del Toro - nothing wrong with his performance\\, but the role itself felt type-cast and cliche - the characters felt fairly authentic.  It should also be mentioned that Laura Dern played perhaps the most understated character in the film\\, and was excellent despite the relatively little screen time and late introduction.\\n\\nThis analysis could go on into great detail ad nauseum\\, but there are enough other reviews out there picking at details that it's simply unnecessary.  Suffice it to say that this film - while technically sound and reasonably well-acted - was off in terms of story and flavor and was unfortunately a disappointment once the dust settled and the experience had soaked in and been thoroughly processed.","true":true}
