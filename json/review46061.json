Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but woefully lacking in writing\\, directing and editing. On first viewing 5\/10 and on second viewing where the flaws are more obvious it gets 3\/10. A shame as with some decent editing\\, dialogue changes and re-shoots it has the potential to be an enjoyable film.","true":true}
