Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great to see star wars back in action. Although Lukes portrayal was a crime against humanity. totally destroyed the character we loved dearly. Rey was good and the twist with Kylo Ten and Snope towards the end was a nice move.","true":true}
