Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst Sw movie yet...Rian johnson wants to kill the past and start over with new characters but does it by crapping on the fans who've been with the franchise for 40 years.  disney doesn't want our money anymore?!  every male character in tlj was portrayed as  a clown\/bafoon or simply killed off (Luke\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Kylo\\, Hux\\, snoke\\, akbar) .  I don't have a problem with female characters - I've always loved leia\\, but rose\\, rey\\, and holdo are one dimensional and forgettable. I liked Captain Phasma and would've like to see more of her.  I'm not a bigot or a caveman (pablo Hidalgo)and  i dont care which gender or race you put in a movie\\, but give us good characters and good stories\\, AND STOP ATTACKING original FAN$","true":true}
