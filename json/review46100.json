Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, some great action\\, and... well... that's about it really. The story is muddled and takes too long at parts. Too many things can be pointed out that don't really make sense or could be considered disappointing. Some people are saying episode 9 will make this one make more sense but that doesn't really make this movie good if you need it's sequal to enjoy it.","true":true}
