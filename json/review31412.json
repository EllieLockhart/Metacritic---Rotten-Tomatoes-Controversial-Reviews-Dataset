Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the best characterizations of the franchise to date. It's officially my 3rd favorite film of the franchise following Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One. Carrie Fisher's performance was nuanced and heartfelt. The tension between Rey and Kylo Ren was believable and interesting. I'd highly recommend this film.","true":true}
