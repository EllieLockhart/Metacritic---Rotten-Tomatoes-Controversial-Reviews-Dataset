Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away\\, a really shitty script\\, was executed in a really horrible way. This film just continues the creation of crap aimed at selling toys for a young generation\\, in an otherwise rich universe. Absolute garbage\\, with every imaginable cliche in the series\\, and some really dumb villains. The over-emphasis on emotional issues really kills me inside - it's just so bad. And the new characters? Annoying and forgettable. You get 1 star for the cool computer graphics as usual. Long story short\\, this movie feels like it was written by a child\\, for children.","true":true}
