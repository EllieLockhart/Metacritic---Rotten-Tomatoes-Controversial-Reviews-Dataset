Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't normally take the time to give reviews\\, but this film is receiving a LOT of undeserved (and some deserved) hatred. It has some glaring flaws: casino planet\\, Leia space-walk\\, Snoke's role\\, Luke's behavior and motivations\\, and a host of SJW nonsense which the critics seen to like for some reason.\\n\\nAt the end of the day\\, though\\, this film has more highlights than lowlights. The movie isn't stale and predictable like Ep. 7 was. The Kylo\/Rey team up vs. the Pretorian guards is the best duel scene we've seen since Ep. 3's Anakin vs. Obi-Wan. Yoda's appearance was unexpected and welcome. The light-speed battering ram attack\\, while being one of the movie's bigger plot holes\\, is still a spectacle and something never seen before.\\n\\nStar Wars (Ep 4) was one of my first movies seen as a child\\, and holds a special place in my heart. For me\\, TLJ is about two things: 1) failure is the dominant prevailing theme of the movie\\, and 2) a changing of the guard to a new generation of Jedi\/Rebels. The kid at the end force-pulling the broom to himself and holding it like a lightsaber is foreshadowing this.\\n\\nAs much as I love the originals\\, this isn't Luke or Leia's story anymore. It's Rey's and Finn's. If you can't deal with that\\, you will not like this film.\\n\\n7.5\/10","true":true}
