Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think any Star Wars fan going into this film is expecting some level of predictability\\, over-dramatized scenes\\, and general corniness. That is why we love Star Wars. They are simple and mystical and good for the soul. \\n\\nHowever\\, this film made cowards of our heroes\\, introduced ridiculous and unnecessary powers for the Jedi's\\, forced too many story arcs in a single film\\, and limited its best characters and actors. \\n\\nSimply - it was bad writing\\, (very) bad and ill-timed jokes\\, and poorly constructed. It doesn't have to be Shakespeare - but please don't insult us again.","true":true}
