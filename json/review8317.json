Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Feels like this Gita bunch of notes from Executives and assistants who think they know better. I liked it the first time but the second time made me realize what a hunk of junk this movie is. The timeline makes no sense. I still can\u2019t get passed that at the end of Jedi\\, the Empire was defeated\\, now 30 years later there are only 400 remaining members of the resistance? And Luke who saw the light in his own father\\, the most horrible villain ever\\, now has given up hope? Leia is just cool with Luke killing her son? There are a million shitty holes. Sure this movie was fun but the more you dissect it the worse it gets. ","true":true}
