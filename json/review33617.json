Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Just a movie more worried about the artistic then the bigger universe. Its like the writer has never seen a star wars movie or book ever in his life and just read the cliff notes. The plot seems to twist in a forceful arrogant way as a child does the opposite his parents say.","true":true}
