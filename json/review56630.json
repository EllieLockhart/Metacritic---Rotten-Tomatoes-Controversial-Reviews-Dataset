{"101487":175567,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-01","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\, like The Force Awakens before it\\, fails to satisfy in nearly every way.  The first film sets up potent mysteries: Who are Rey's parents?  Who is Supreme Leader Snoke?  How is Rey so powerful in the Force with absolutely no training?  The Last Jedi takes these important questions and unceremoniously tears them apart with\\, in some cases\\, no explanation whatsoever.  This doesn't feel so much like the director attempting to go in some bold\\, new direction as it does a cop out\\, an unnecessary\\, unsatisfying twist masquerading as Star Wars reinvented for a new generation.  The attempts at humor feel forced\\, fall flat\\, and are simply not funny.  Although there were some things I liked about the film (greater casting diversity\\, special effects)\\, it was not enough to counterbalance an awful script and the director's misguided vision. After watching The Force Awakens\\, I walked into this movie with low expectations.  Sadly\\, this film confirmed my cynicism.  If you are a fan of the original trilogy\\, more than likely you will continue to be disappointed by the films of the new trilogy.  The humor is bad\\, the plot twists make no sense\\, and\\, in the words of Admiral Ackbar\\, \\\"It's a trap!\\\"","true":true}
