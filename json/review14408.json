Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had many issues with this movie\\, most of which can be read in any click bait article about it. I disagree with many of those as well. The villains were not menacing\\, and lacked even a shred of dignity\\, but for thesterious Snoke. Many of TFA's setups were tossed aside\\, and the impossible odds were overcome to easily and to often. However\\, much of my disappointment was due to a failure to meet my personal expectations\\, and a movie can't be rated that way. The  Last Jedi wasn't the best Star Wars movie\\, but it still honored the SW universe\\, and for that reason it is not relegated to the waste bin in which the prequels reside. Over all\\, a decent SW movie still gets 4 stars in my book. I'll watch it again\\, and unapologetically.","true":true}
