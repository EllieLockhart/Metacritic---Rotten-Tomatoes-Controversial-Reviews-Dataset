Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only positives are the visual effects and the music (The music does nothing new but is on par in term of series quality). Visual effects and music don't give much substance however when the underlying writing and directing is so poor. There was extremely little character development for the main characters or any real advancement on the core and more exciting or intriguing foundations built through the SW movies and especially those more recently within the Force awakens\\, the previous movie. In fact it seemed to work almost directly against that previous movie and instead of leaving viewers with some strong anticipation of whats coming next it serves to completely kill enthusiasm for the remainder of the trilogy by blatantly disrespecting its predecessors. There is also clear ignorance towards Star Wars Lore and this only serves to hurt the franchise. All other Star wars movies you can go back and appreciate the intelligence and foresight that goes into the story and character development\\, but this one is really quite detrimental to star wars overall. An enormous disappointment and I fear this will also hold the next film back from greatness because it will need to rectify the many mistakes made in this film.","true":true}
