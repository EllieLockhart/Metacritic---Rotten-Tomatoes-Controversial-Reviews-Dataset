Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi lives up to the hype. Easily one of the best movies of the year due to stunning visuals\\, great storytelling\\, humor\\, and uniqueness. It is very different from the original trilogy\\, but that's what makes this movie refreshing to see. Star Wars fan or not\\, this is a must see.","true":true}
