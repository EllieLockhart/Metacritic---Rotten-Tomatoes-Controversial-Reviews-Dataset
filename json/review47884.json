Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While a well-made film\\, with some interesting plot points and characters\\, the sharp departure from the setup of the last film and legacy of the original trilogy may sour star wars fans enjoyment. As well as this more subjective complaint the actions of some characters are not well explained there are plot points that lead nowhere and an extremely forced romance sub plot. At many points satisfying conclusions to set ups are trade in for the shock value of a bait and switch. On a more lore based level the expansion of force powers within the film brings up questions about earlier films as well one specific thing later in the film that has never before been alluded to and seemed only to crop up as a resulted of a desired end point. Moving back to more subjective issues the treatment of legacy characters like Admiral Akbar and Luke may leave a bad taste in the mouth of those who were attached to them\\, with Akbar being killed off with no pomp or circumstance early in the film. Finally the themes of this movie seem largely incongruous with that of prior films\\, where early placed emphasis on the importance of high risk high reward actions and cooperation this film actively punishes those who do such things. Finally to expand on issues of the character changes in Luke\\, the character goes from optimism and strong family bonds to a grouchy\\, isolated\\, uncaring and withdrawn pessimist. Adequate reason is never given as to why Luke has left and let the first order advance as it has\\, or abandoned his nephew despite the clear need for his influence and the parallels to one can draw to plot lines with Vader. Despite determination to save his father\\, an objectively further gone character who Luke had less of a connection to\\, the hero of the rebellion seemed content to let his nephew fall to the dark side and excuses given in the script fall short of justifying such action. In conclusion if you can enjoy this film hat's great and encourage you to do so\\, however I and many others were dissatisfied with the treatment of legacy characters\\, established themes and the abandonment of plot lines established in The Force Awakens.","true":true}
