Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is full of plot holes and petty humour that it basically is spitting in all George has created in his trilogy. It baffles me that Critics are lying to you and themselves just to make themselves believe Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good film. Lightsabers don't do much damage as they once did anymore\\, even though\\, Lightsabers are the bread and butter of all things Star Wars. \\n\\nOnce you see it you know exactly what you're watching. But in the new films\\, Lightsabers do basically nothing. It gave Kylo a scar over his face after it was struck by Rey. Including when Kylo struck Finn in the back with his 'Unstable\\\" Lightsaber which would do even more damage than Luke's Lightsaber would. This film\\, Finn is fine and healthy\\, unharmed whatsoever after being hit by one of the most deadly weapons in Star Wars\\, and they wrapped him in a bubble-boy suit to add a comedic scene while he falls over. If Finn became a paraplegic\\, I would understand from a Lightsaber slicing his spinal cord. As I said before\\, this film has plot holes\\, from Princess Leia\\, suddenly being able to use the force\\, with no years of practising and\/or training to know how to use it. \\\"Oh yeah\\, she has the force now\\, deal with it manbabies\\\" is not a good answer Disney. And the entire scene at the end\\, was horrid.\\n\\n They killed off Luke in the most pathetic way possible. A man that has been around since the start of Order 66\\, dies because Disney wanted a Plot Twist ending. \\n\\nIn my true\\, honest opinion\\, these films are not canon and should be considered as fan-made films. I am not looking forward for the next film.","true":true}
