Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was full of cheesy lines and was without a plot. This was a horrible continuation of the starwars movies by George lucas. Most of the scenes inappropriately  dramatic and over-used close up shots. The only people who could enjoy this movie is 10yrs and under.  I went to the theater expecting a film akin to George Lucas's Star Wars and was extremely disappointed and very bored. There wwas inconsistencies in the storyline and frankly not much of a story at all. Only part I liked was the 3D space ship in the beginning of the movie.  I recommend a boycott to Disney starwars to demand a higher quality movie in the future.","true":true}
