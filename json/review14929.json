Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just created a Rotten Tomatoes account just to thumbs down this abomination of a film. Can you give zero stars? I could only get it down to 1\/2. I wouldn't trust Rian Johnson to make a box of macaroni and cheese. How much were those \\\"journalist\\\" reviewers paid to review this schlock favorably? Hey Disney\\, I'll never give you another penny for your disrespectful treatment of this beloved franchise. It's actually very sad.","true":true}
