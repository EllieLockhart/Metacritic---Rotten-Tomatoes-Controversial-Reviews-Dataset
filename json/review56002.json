Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seeing the Audience Score for this film surprises me. Though making a lot of risks unlike past entries in the saga\\, this film perfectly captured the complexities of being good or bad\\, what it means to be human. I think Fisher would have considered it a great ending to her cinematic career. And\\, I think fans need to see the film again and process everything that happens in this film\\, because so much does happen and this score seems to be a gut reaction to those things. I mean\\, is it really worse that the Prequels? No\\, it\u2019s not. ","true":true}
