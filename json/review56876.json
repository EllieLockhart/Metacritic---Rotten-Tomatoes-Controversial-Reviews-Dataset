Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a message here for Rian Johnson and Disney in all these negative reviews. Treat the audience with respect and it will respect you back. Treat them with arrogant contempt\\, and they will take a dump all over your film in response. \\n\\nCritics\\, unfortunately\\, have taken Rian Johnson at his own high estimation and seen worthy and insightful themes in TLJ\\, when really there are none. The only theme of this film is the director's overweening superiority over what he judges his audiences expectations to be. \\n\\nJohnson has created a version of SW fandom in his own head - telling himself that fans only want the old heroes acting heroically and triumphing  completely in the end - and then set about subverting that self-created view. All of this to cheers from the critics\\, who reveal their own vanity and superiority in doing so. \\n\\nBut fans and general viewers are more sophisticated than that. Fans are not resistant to new ideas. Quite the opposite.  They just want to see things done well\\, without the mess of illogical plotting\\, character inconsistencies and sloppy application of the universe's rules\\, that is served up by The Last Jedi.\\n\\nAnd here's the other thing. It was Disney's choice to bring the Original Trilogy characters back - not the fans.  It was Disney's choice to offer up a pale retread of A New Hope in TFA.  Now it is Disney's choice to seemingly burn it all down\\, and dump on the existing characters\\, all in the name of being subversive.  This is the dog eating it's own tale. The only thing this film subverts is itself!\\n\\nMeanwhile\\, fans just sit there\\, waiting to be told good stories with good characters\\, set within the SW Universe. And they continue to wait\\, all the while wondering why Disney and Lucasfilm seem so entirely incapable of doing so.\\n \\nSo here's my advice to them - start employing writers and directors who can tell a cogent story in the space of a couple of hours\\, and who respect their audiences to be able to follow.  Don't employ directors like Abrams and Johnson\\, who revel in withholding necessary back-story and salient details\\, just so that they can create meaningless mysteries or spring pointless surprises on us. \\n\\nTreat us with respect and we will respect you back.","true":true}
