Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, really enjoyed the movie\\, especially what they did with Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo. It was a bit over long and the rest of the plot was meh\\, but overall I enjoyed it besides a few really stupid scenes.","true":true}
