Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero stars if I could... So long and empty. The casino arc was so bad it was unintentionally the funniest part of this shit show. Hated the fuck out of this Sci-Fi channel version of star wars. Utter bullshit. At least the director had Girl-Luke save the Jedi Tomes at the end. Hated the dumpy little Asian chick. Useless. \\n\\nAbrams is back for the final installment\\, hopefully he can rework his TFA magi and fix this abortion of a film.","true":true}
