Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A revolting and nihilistic destruction of Star Wars mythology.  Perversion of the characters\\, bizarre and unnecessary sequences\\, massively inconsistent - not just with the original character's presentations and the prequels\\, but Force Awakens.  A horrible\\, horrible movie.  And keep in mind the total elapsed time from the beginning of Force Awakens to the end of this film is ~10 days (maybe less - as few as three or four days).\\n\\nA horrible\\, horrible film.  Frankly\\, not even a Star Wars film.  An embarrassment.  See why Hamill hates it.","true":true}
