Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never felt so compelled to write a review after seeing a movie until see The Last Jedi. This was supposed to be the Star Wars movies above all Star Wars movies\\, and I was certainly disappointed. Being a big fan of the Star Wars franchise\\, my initial response was to defend the movie after seeing it for the first time. But I found myself unsure as to why I was defending it at all. There were some beautiful shots and moments\\, but overall the story was mediocre. It gave the audience very little fan service to touch upon loved classic characters\\, introduced new characters unnecessarily\\, AND ONLY HAD ONE LIGHTSABER FIGHT SCENE. You would think with today's technology\\, we would get at least two lightsaber fights. Overall\\, and underwhelming Star Wars film.","true":true}
