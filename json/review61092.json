The first one for me was the best game ever created with incredible characters and story. I finished it 16 times honest. Everything that made ma love the first one is missing in the second one. Characters i was excited to see again are acting like different persons\\, they even have less screentime than the new ones. And the new ones ? They are incredibly bland and uninteresting.. And for the record i dont minde lesbians\\, female characters or anything. Its just that it doesnt work in this game. It was supposed to be about Ellie and Joel\\, period. What this game suffers from the most is the shock value. Somehow masters of storytelling\\, at least until this game Naughty Dog did the absolute cheapest and lamest decision in order to shock us. I expected much more from them.. Well at least this game taught me to never again be excited for something when it comes to good storytelling and never again trust Neil Druckmann as a writer. PS: 2 points for graphics and voice acting.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
