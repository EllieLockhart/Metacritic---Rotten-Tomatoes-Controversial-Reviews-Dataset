Probably get the PS5 with disk so I don't get stuck with a unsellable game with zero replay value again.   The Story is poorly done and even if it had been done well would have been nothing you wanted if you liked the first game.

I was looking forward to this game took vacation to play it and they should have done better\\, twists are fine and all but if you writing is so bad you have to torture the player to pull them off maybe go back to the drawing board.  Game play\\, level design and graphics are topnotch and I've played plenty of games were I didn't care about the story and even though I loved the first games narrative I could have just enjoyed the video game if they did not so force the story on you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
