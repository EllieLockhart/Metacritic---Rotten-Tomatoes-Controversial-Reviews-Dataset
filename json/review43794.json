Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst star wars yet!  The idiot that directed this ruined Luke Skywalker.  The plot is trash.  And seriously who are these critics that gave this a 92?  Did they even watch the movie??  The real audience ratting of 53 was more than generous.  I for one will skip the next Star Wars installment if this is the best they can do.","true":true}
