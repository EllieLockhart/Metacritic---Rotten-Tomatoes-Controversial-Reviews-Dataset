Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killed star wars for me and everyone I know who was also a star wars junkie.  I was disgusted 10 minutes in and wanted to vomit it all out when it was over.","true":true}
