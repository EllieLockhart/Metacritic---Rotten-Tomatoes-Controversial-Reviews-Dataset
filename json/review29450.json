Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has accomplished what I believed was a near impossible feat; The Last Jedi is one of my Top 3 favourite Star Wars films. In fact\\, I rank The Last Jedi as being second only to Star Wars: Return of the Jedi as my favourite Star Wars film. Yes\\, I prefer The Last Jedi to The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: A New Hope.\\n\\nI understand if you are shocked by this statement. Still\\, it is just my opinion. No Star Wars film has emotionally impacted me this much since I watched Return of the Jedi for the first time as a child. This became apparent to me during my second viewing of the film. As I said\\, I needed a second viewing because I was somewhat in shock after my first experience with The Last Jedi.\\n\\nTruly\\, The Last Jedi is a ballsy\\, unique film which\\, in a great way\\, left me stunned. Indeed\\, on my first viewing\\, my mouth was agape during certain moments in The Last Jedi. Some of the moments in this film rank amongst the best of the Star Wars franchise. I appreciated those shocking moments and the emotional moments of this film so much more during my second viewing.\\n\\nYou better believe that they are plentiful in The Last Jedi. Still\\, if a film does not have great acting from its cast\\, it will fail in its emotional moments. Thankfully\\, this is not the case with The Last Jedi. The performances are immaculate. Indeed\\, I would argue that no Star Wars film has ever had the quality of acting that is on show in The Last Jedi.","true":true}
