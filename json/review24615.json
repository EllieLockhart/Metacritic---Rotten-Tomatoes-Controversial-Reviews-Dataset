Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie started off okay but it basically turned into a rehash of every Star Wars moment ever and regurgitated without a soul. They were giving Finn a good story arc of being the sacrificing hero to save everyone in the base and instead they have this idiot Rose crash into and save him because of love. WTF!!! We dont have to have a god dam love story in this. Just kill him off. He was much less likable in this movie along with Poe. The killing off of Luke was ridiculous and having Yoda show up to burn the Jedi books was stupid. Its basically saying  They basically treated Luke like a child still instead of an adult. Dont waste your time seeing this movie. They should of just worked out some scripts based on the Books previously written. Those story arcs were much better than this turd of a film. I highly doubt I will see the next one.","true":true}
