Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"<< SPOILERSS>>\\n\\nNot only was I bored watching it\\, it is also disappointing. \\nThe best bits was when Luke or Leia was on the screen. They have such strong presents. The Leia bits are pretty nicely written\\, but the rest  are just so poorly written. I agree with the notion that Luke and the Jedi are the most optimistic people in the galaxy. I mean look at Obi Wan. Only after Anakin enacted the evil deeds (murdering the young jedi\\, killing Mace Windu\\, and siding with Palpatine) did Obi Wan gives up hope on Anakin. And even then He only disables Anakin. Vader is a Sith Lord\\, and that is why Luke actively tries to defeat him. And even then\\, he does not give up to the dark side.\\n\\nIn the Last Jedi\\, Luke has had far more training and whatnot than when he was in Return of Jedi. So he must must must must be much much much wiser. He cannot\\, be that afraid of another potential Sith Lord - And I do mean Potential - as he already faced one of the greatest Sith Lord of all time. I am sure he will not resort to murder. It is so uncharacteristic of Luke. It just cannot happen.\\n\\nAnd who is Snoke? I mean\\, even if we accept that Luke contemplating to killing Ben Solo causes Ben to turn to seek the dark side\\, he wouldn't find it if it not for Snoke. An Snoke is not on any of the previous trilogies. So who is it? Why is a character with such profound effect on the storyline is not properly explained. Am I missing something?\\n\\nAnd the whole Casino thing is bad\\, and the space chase-standoff doesn't sit right with me\\, and the whole galactic telephatic communication is ridicilous\\, and Rey parents.....\\n\\nAll in all\\, this movie is a mess of story telling. More so than the Force awaken (which I would rate as below average.)","true":true}
