Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely terrible as a Star Wars! In fact I would be hard pressed to call it a Star Wars movie... the plot was extremely weak\\, the force abilities were extremely far fetched\\, Rian Johnson absolutely trashed Luke Skywalker and betrayed who he was as a hero character to any die hard fan and there was no back story for Snoke whatsoever and now he's dead??? Disney officially killed Star Wars! As far as I'm concerned\\, the story ends with episode 6 when Anakin destroyed the Sith and his son Luke saved him by turning him back to the light\\, and the galaxy lived happily ever after! Episode 7 was so so and they set up something that \\\"could've\\\" been great! They dropped the ball BIG TIME","true":true}
