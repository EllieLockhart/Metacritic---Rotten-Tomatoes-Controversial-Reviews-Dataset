Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of those films that gets better every time you watch it. Rian Johnson layered this story so well that it's going to be one of the most rewarding Star Wars films of all time. There's stuff in here for the diehard fans as well as newcomers to Star Wars. It's just an amazing film.","true":true}
