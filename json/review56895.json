Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were so many epic parts of this movie and I left speechless.  My wife and I didn't even know what to say.  Rey is incredible as well as Kylo.  The entire movie was very emotional: funny\\, sad\\, tense\\, excited\\, etc.  \\nSpoilers ahead****\\n\\n\\nOne thing that I loved\\, is they showed how sometimes missions fail and not everything always works out the way that you want.  I thought that they answered a lot of questions\\, but left a lot to look forward to for the next one.\\n\\nThe only thing that I didn't like was the unexplained way that Leia survived being in space and wooshing her way back to the ship.  Other than that part\\, I loved every single second of it.","true":true}
