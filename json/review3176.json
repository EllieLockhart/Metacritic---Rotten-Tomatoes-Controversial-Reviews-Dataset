Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beaucoup aim\u00e9 cet \u00e9pisode VIII. :)\\nMark Hammil est super.\\nBen Solo est plus int\u00e9ressant dans cet opus.\\nVisuellement peut-\u00eatre un peu faible.\\nMais l'histoire est sympa.","true":false}
