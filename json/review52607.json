Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All fandom aside this was not a well written film. There were huge plot holes ie. why let your ships get blown up when you could have just been hyper-spacing them into the Empire's ships all along? There were three disjointed stories occurring at the same time for most of the film. The tone of the film was drastically uneven\\, every dramatic moment was immediately undermined by forced comedic moments\\, or shifting to a different uneven story. It is a narrative nightmare spending tons of film time on characters that don't have a clear reason for being in the story. If is fine if you want to subvert all these tropes\\, but you have to replace them with something of substance\\, Johnson does not do this. More than anything this writing and story telling was reminiscent of Jurassic World at best and a Michael Bay film at worst. Please try discussing this films numerous flaws which have nothing to do with fandom. If this film was named anything other than Star Wars I really wonder how people would be reviewing it\\, my guess is it would be being destroyed by critics and viewers alike.?","true":true}
