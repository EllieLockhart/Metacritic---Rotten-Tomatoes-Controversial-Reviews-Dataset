Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stunned. Absolutely stunned at how a director could take the hero of a core epic of our time and completely invalidate and debase his existence. He violated ever core aspect of Luke as a character. Rian should be ashamed of himself.","true":true}
