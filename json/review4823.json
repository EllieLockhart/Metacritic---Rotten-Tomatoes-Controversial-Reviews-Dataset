Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete\\, utter\\, feminist-propaganda trash. The women were all strong and dominant while the men were fumbling\\, bumbling idiots. Disney and critics continue to attempt to gaslight the upset fans into coercing them through guilt into thinking that this is actually a great movie. Not only is it a bad Star Wars movie\\, it's bad on its own to begin with. The Resistance or Rebellion\\, or whatever they are called anymore\\, ran to of fuel and the First Order couldn't find a way to blow them to smithereens? Please...give me a break.","true":true}
