Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the worst Star Wars movie to date.  Plenty of head scratching moments that leave you wondering wtf  was the writer\/director thinking.  Certain plots could of easily been cut from the film since nothing came of them.  Instead of trying to make certain villains bigger\\, and have some sort of meaning\\, they just take a crap on them.  I felt half of the things in the movie just made no sense at all.  They didn't do anything for the characters either\\, no great send offs or anything.  Just let me thinking\\, \\\"thats it?\\\"\\n\\nLuke's attitude makes no sense either.  He wants to be left alone\\, yet he gave C3P0 his location in case they needed to find him.  He was found\\, now he's saying\\, \\\"go away?\\\"","true":true}
