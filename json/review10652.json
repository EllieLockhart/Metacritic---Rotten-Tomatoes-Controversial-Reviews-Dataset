Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had good direction but fell apart in a lot of scenes. Seemed misdirected and all over the place. Didn't know why the Casino scene took as long as it did. This movie had a lack of character development and in the long run the movie just fell flat. It was ok\\, but as I think about it more the movie had many areas where it could of improved upon.","true":true}
