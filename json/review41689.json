Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is my worst nightmare of what Disney would do to the Star Wars universe. It is just milking it for it\u2019s name and destroying and amazing imaginative universe in the process. This movie made me want to cry for one of my favorite universes and stories of all time and what they have done to it in this movie.","true":true}
