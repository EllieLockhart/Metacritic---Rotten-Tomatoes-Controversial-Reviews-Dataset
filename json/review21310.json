Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with zero expectations and was pleasantly entertained\\, but after leaving the theater and thinking back on what exactly I just watched\\, the sad realization of how poorly written the story and dialogue was came upon me. The acting was stellar from beginning to end. The all star cast did a great job with what they had to work with\\, but all in all\\, this movie isn't great or even close to a master piece. It's an okay Star Wars Disney fan fiction. Here's hoping that Episode IX will somehow be salvageable from the mess this movie created. JJ Abrams\\, please do a better job and save this franchise.","true":true}
