Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't even begin to say how bad this film was in terms of script. Visually spectacular but the character development was abysmal. The writers must have all been coked off their skulls when they wrote this. Luke Skywalkers is ridiculous. The social justice warrior propaganda was heavy handed and unbearable to watch. I think this is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen.","true":true}
