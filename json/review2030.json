Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who knows way more about Star Wars than how to talk to women\\, it brings me no joy in saying I was let down thoroughly by this film. \\n\\nWhy it maintains all the great things about the Star Wars universe that we've grown to love in it's charismatic characters and stunning visuals\\, 'The Last Jedi' decides to flip off fans by laughing at the notion that the main story points we were promised would be resolved in 'The Force Awakens' ever actually mattered. \\n\\nThe performances are solid to great at times\\, and the narrative is not at fault at all. It simply comes down to Rian Johnson finding it hilarious that we ever cared at any point about these new characters or where they were going\\, and insisting that the true story to be told here is all about how anyone can be a hero.
