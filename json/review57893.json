Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment.  I made this RT account just to leave a 1-star review to balance out all the critics reviews (93% fresh at the time of this review... you've got to be kidding me).  Films like this really make me wish Star wars had just stuck to the original trilogy\\, or at least ended after the last of George Lucas' prequels.  It's clear since Disney has taken control of the franchise that Star Wars has just become a massive marketing engine to sell merchandise.  They've also lowered the level of writing and dialogue to clearly appeal to the target audience of 6-13 y\/o kids for all of the aforementioned merchandise.  For example when Leia\/Holdo (can't remember which) finally reveal the shuttle escape plan to Poe Dameron\\, he immediately repeats back the plan - this level of forced exposition makes for a terrible film and again is just catering to the Disney target audience.\\n\\nI can understand arguments that in order for the films to be made profitably\\, Disney needs to cater to the lowest common denominator.  IMO though\\, it's a slap in the face to the original trilogy and we would have all been better off had these not been made at all.","true":true}
