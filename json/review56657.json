Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi unfortunately doesn't work as a stand alone movie\\, as a sequel\\, or as an episode in the Star Wars universe. Judged on its own\\, the characters\\, as well as their motivations\\, are unexplained and undeveloped and they don't do anything worthwhile with few exceptions. As a sequel\\, it drops many things Episode VII set up and leaves very little to work with.\\n\\nSPOILERS: Episode VII set up the First Order as an evil organization bent on galactic supremecy with their most important goal as finding the map to Luke Skywalker\\, with Snoke as its mysterious and powerful leader. In Episode VIII\\, the First Order wasn't shown to be evil and instead was mostly inept\\, Snoke died quickly\\, and Luke Skywalker barely made a difference to the Rebellion he unabandoned or to the First Order's plans.\\n\\nThe entire plot of the movie is a long\\, slow chase where progressively more Rebellion members die or kill themselves. Fortunately\\, Kylo Ren\\, the leader of the First Order\\, remains interesting and so Rey of the Rebellion still has someone to psychologically battle in the sequel\\, though her backstory was also dropped. Unfortunately other characters' arcs from the Rebels in Episode VII like Po and Finn were wasted (and in their case\\, ended up harming the Rebellion) while Carrie Fisher failed as a general but not in our hearts.\\n\\nSome of my friends enjoyed parts of the movie so 2.5 stars.","true":true}
