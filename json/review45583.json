Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing movie. Horrible writing that is completely inconsistent with the Star Wars lore. All the plot twists are insulting to Star Wars fans who love the characters and the previous movies. So much have been said about how terrible this movie is so there's no need for me to list them here. Stop pretending that all the negative reviews are written by bots or manufactured with duplicate accounts - people really don't like this movie!\\n\\n1 star for the great audiovisuals.","true":true}
