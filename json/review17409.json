Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie only because the people I was with insisted I see this movie with them. I had no interest of seeing this movie\\, I heard rumors it sucked. Well I am here to tell you those rumors are true. I have never in my life seen a blockbuster so careless in my life. BASICALLY\\, DISNEY TOLD OTF'S TO GO F THEMSELVES. They never handled the older characters with respect\\, newer characters were poorly developed\\, there was some hyper political elements in this movie (which makes no sense.) So I am going to have to say that this movie is not worth the money for the cost of the ticket. Don't believe the shady reviews or the hype it sucks!","true":true}
