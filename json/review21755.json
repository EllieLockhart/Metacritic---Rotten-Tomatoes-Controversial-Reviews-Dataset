Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just awful\\, I loved TFA immensely and was looking forward to TLJ but what I saw was a slap in the face to the fans that actually KNOW 'how the force work's.' Luke flippantly throwing his (father's) lightsaber over his \\nshoulder when TFA had built up the drama of the moment  so beautifully\\, Firm's character was completely wasted as was Captain Phasma and yet Phasma is VERY much the poster girl of the trailers yet her character is on screen for just a couple of minutes before being binned yet again\\, Luke facing off against Kylo via force image projection - SERIOUSLY are you trying your hardest to insult us? Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley performed well as did the prop makers\\, make up artists and effects team\\, what a wasted opportunity....","true":true}
