Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first act of the movie with the giant space fight was really interesting and an explosive way to start the movie. This all comes to a dead stop with side plots that take away from the main synergy of the movie with the relationship between Rey and Finn. Along with unnecessary jokes that fall flat in the movie told from characters that are not supposed to be funny and unanswered questions that leave the audience without answers\\, this all takes away from the movie's core of the struggle of the resistance's survival after the effects from TFA and the internal conflict with Ben Solo and Rey trying to find her place in the galaxy. Overall\\, a good movie\\, but with some glaring problems that detract from the core story in this movie","true":true}
