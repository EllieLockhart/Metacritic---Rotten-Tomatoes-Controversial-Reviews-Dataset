Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I may come back to write a full review\\, but for now\\, this is to combat the crazy low ratings from an apparently heavily divided fan base. This movie had it's issues\\, but it was the most Star Warsy movie we've had since Jedi. I think people are just too caught up in what they thought the film was going to be. Some of the surprise reveals were that there was no reveal at all\\, and I thought it was brilliant. *shrugs*","true":true}
