Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an absolute garbage fire.  From the boring as a plank characters to the terrible attempts at humor to the pathetically crafted storyline\\, this is an absolute sh*tshow of a garbagefire.   No wonder Hamill was trying to sound the alarm about this months ago.  At least the critics have now outed themselves as being paid stooges for Disney.  Seems like it wasn't enough for the likes of Fox and CNN to be fake\\, the critics now have to get in on in it too.","true":true}
