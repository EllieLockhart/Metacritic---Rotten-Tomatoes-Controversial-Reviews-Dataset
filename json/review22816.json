Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Logic is sacrificed in order to push a political message. Characters from the original trilogy are portrayed as failures and act contrary to how they behaved for all three original films. Creativity is on an all time low as far as set-design\\, costume design\\, location and world building. Like the Force Awakens The Last Jedi borrows many beats from the original l movies but fails to tell a cohesive story.","true":true}
