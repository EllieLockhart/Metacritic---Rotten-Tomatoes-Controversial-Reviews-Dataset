Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many others. I have many mixed feelings about Star Wars TLJ.\\n\\nOverall it was great and easily worth the watch\\, but it's really a shame\\, because this movie could have been about a million times better.\\n\\nThe story at times felt like it was written by a 5 year old\\, there were so many plot holes and points where the story again could of been just simply better.\\n\\nNegatives aside\\, I've given this a 4 1\/2 rating because of how well this movie performed otherwise. The visuals... oh my god. Truly beautiful. Also I love the world of star wars and watching this movie in 4D was a huge immersive bonus for me.\\n\\nThe acting\\, especially from Mark Hamill was spectacular\\, he really managed to bring Luke Skywalker back after all these years and it felt truly immersive.","true":true}
