Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnston you are a disgrace. What you have done is nothing short of disgraceful and frankly you should NEVER get your grubby hands on another Star Wars movie again !!! This movie is a devistating FAIL on all levels. A boring\\, disrespectful and disgusting exhibition of movie making that has destroyed Star Wars movies forever.  DO NOT SEE THIS RUBBISH. JUST WATCH THE ORIGINALS AND FORGET 8 EVEN EXISTS. JJ hurry back \\, you ARE OUR ONLY HOPE !!!!!!! PLEASE SAVE US JJ. \\n\\nABSOLUTE DISGRACE !!!!","true":true}
