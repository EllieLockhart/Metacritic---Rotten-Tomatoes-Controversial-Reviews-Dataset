Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a travesty of a storyline wrapped in high-budget cinematography.  This movie shows utter disregard for the framework established by JJ Abrams in TFA\\, taking the trilogy in a completely new (read: \\\"horrendous\\\") direction.  Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy made TLJ for the social justice warriors and liberal elitists - steering directly into overtly political and polarizing topics.  Moreover\\, their commitment to injecting their political opinions into Star Wars is done so at the expense of character development\/progression and story arc.  Casual\\, liberal Star Wars fans will probably love the continuation of the Mary Sue Rey with anti-capitalistic and pro-feminist overtones.  Real Star Wars fans will be pissed off that Luke Skywalker is entirely castrated in this film\\, and that TLJ fails to deliver on any of what they had expected in the lead up to this film.  This story could not have been worse.  Utter and total failure.","true":true}
