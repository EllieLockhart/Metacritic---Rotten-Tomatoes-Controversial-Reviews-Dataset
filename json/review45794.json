Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very overrated with bad plot twists and lines. It tried to appeal to too many audiences\\, which fails all of them. Since it's a Star Wars movie you need to see it\\, but wait until Netflix. I wanted my $$ back. Only Jaja could have made it worse.","true":true}
