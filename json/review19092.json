Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's great to see how Johnson managed to create a solid well written screenplay\\, who explores the feelings of the characters way better than \\\"the force awakens\\\" did. Visually perfect\\, gorgeously directed\\, Whit some little plot twists and except for few plot holes\\, a profound movie which helps the franchise to become a little more serious and professional.","true":true}
