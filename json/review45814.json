{"101487":192479,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very poorly written. I felt that the story was a bit scattered\\, and all the questions we had after TFA weren't answered (Snoke's Origins) or were disappointing (Rey's parents). Visuals and sound were typially very impressive with LucasArts studios\\, and the acting was up to par. I did leave the theatre thinking it was alright\\, but going over it again made me see past my Star Wars fanboyishness\\, and made me realize all the negatives and the plot holes. Obviously see it for yourself\\, but I cant agree with the Rotten Tomatoes ratings and review.","true":true}
