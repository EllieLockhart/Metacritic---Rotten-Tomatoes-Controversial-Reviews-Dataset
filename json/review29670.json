Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson swung and missed on many possible story arks with this movie while failing to fill any potholes from the previous episode. many things in the main story didn't make sense along with sub plots they were essentially pointless not to mention the feel of the movie all together was completely different than JJ Abrams The Force Awakens. I feel this movie had potential to be possibly the best movie of the series and it ended up being the most disappointing.","true":true}
