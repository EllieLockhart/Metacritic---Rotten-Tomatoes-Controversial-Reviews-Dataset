Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's amazing how divided the Star Wars fan base is on this movie.  I for one enjoyed it\\, and thought it was a huge improvement over episode VII.  The character development was much needed and appreciated\\, the scenes involving Luke and Rey were very well done\\, and it provided several great and memorable scenes I'll remember as some of the best from all Star Wars movies.  It wasn't without its flaws unfortunately\\, but after reading several negative audience reviews\\, I feel they are all over reacting.  The flaws do not ruin what was overall a pretty solid addition to the Star Wars Universe\\, and I encourage more people to look past the nit picking of these fans and appreciate all the great moments this movie has to offer.","true":true}
