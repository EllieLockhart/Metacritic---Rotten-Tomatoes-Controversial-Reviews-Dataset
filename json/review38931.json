Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They\u2019re completely destroying my childhood. If they are going to produce this hot garbage\\, the least they could have done was leave the original characters out of it. Instead\\, the original trilogy and everything that came from it was flushed down the toilet\\, the characters\u2019 lives were wasted\\, their struggle was for nothing. I could have given the movie a couple stars for the effects and visuals but the fact that it was supposed to be a Star Wars movie makes me want to give it a negative rating. Just another in a big line of disappointments\\, I feel sick.","true":true}
