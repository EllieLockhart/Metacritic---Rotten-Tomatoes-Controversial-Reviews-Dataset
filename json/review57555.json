Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made. The Force Awakens ended with a cliffhanger and left us with a lot of unanswered questions. After watching this movie\\, most of them are still left unanswered. There was a huge opportunity for the writers to make greatness and they failed miserably. It was a joke. Bad humor throughout the entire movie. It now makes sense that Mark Hamill wasn't thrilled with the direction his character was going. It was a train wreck. It almost seems like the writers and director didn't bother watching The Force Awakens or any other Star Wars movie. I literally have no desire to see the next movie. When a fan since 1977 doesn't care about the next movie\\, that says something. I won't buy the DVD or buy it on demand. It was really that bad.  Marvel knows how to make a good movie. Disney is really dropping the ball with this franchise.","true":true}
