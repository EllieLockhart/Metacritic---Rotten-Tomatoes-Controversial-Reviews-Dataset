Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star War movie ever because it made the events of episodes 1-6 pointless.  Way to destroy a beloved franchise!  But one star for state of the art special effects.","true":true}
