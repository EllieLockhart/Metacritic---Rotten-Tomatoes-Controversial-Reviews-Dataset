Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving this a 1.5 stars as being frankly just the worst star wars movie. \\nSay what you want with the prequels\\, but at least they didnt go off on whole expose plot from the main store following finn and rose that just took so much away from the main story. \\nand not to mention that its sad that all the new characters of the franchise besides kylo and rey just are awful. Obviosly either forced multicultral characters for the sake of inclusion without any character building what so ever at all.","true":true}
