Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Top to bottom worst Start Wars film.  Poorly written.  Some of the dialogue is so bad there were audible groans in the theater.  The attempts at humor are not in line with the Star Wars feel.  I really wanted to like the movie as a liked most of the new characters from The Force Awakens.  Most of those characters get reduced in this film.  I saw it a second time to make sure I wasn't overly critical the first time.  It was worse.  I look forward to never seeing it again.  Two of the characters introduced in this film are worse than Jar Jar Binks.  I didn't think that was possible.","true":true}
