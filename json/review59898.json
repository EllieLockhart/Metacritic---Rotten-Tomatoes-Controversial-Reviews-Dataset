We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Okay so this is my first time publicly reviewing a game\\, and i wasn't intending to do so but i feel like owe this game some justice and have to defend it since it's getting review bombed for absolutely no reason. This is a masterpiece\\, clearly one of the best if not the best playstation game of all time. A huge improvement from the first game\\, gameplay wise\\, graphics wise and even the story is better. We can clearly see the evolution of the characters between the first and the second game\\, they have matured and are far more complex than in the first game. I get that Joel dying in the first few hours of the game must be a huge turn-off. But this game is all about revenge and it delivers its objective. I found it absolutely intelligent and smart to let you play as both Ellie and Abby because in doing so\\, you can relate to them and you can clearly see why they both did what they did. Abby wanted to avenge her father. Ellie wanted to avenge Joel\\, each one of them clearly had a valid reason to justify the atrocity and brutality of the events that happen in the game. I felt each and every bullet coming out of my bullet. I felt every bullet getting in my body. I COULD relate to these characters. Now the infected added a whole thing to the game\\, killing them was as challenging and scary as ever\\, i still cannot get over the huge infected with multiple heads\\, i was terrified. Thank you Naughty Dog\\, thank you Neil Druckmann. You've made us happy in a really tough time. The game is polished as it should\\, and clearly looks great. I don't mind games getting delayed if the end result is going to be as amazing as this. A masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
