Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen it overseas already\\, I am now wholly engrossed in the sequel trilogy like never before. The story takes risks\\, and the risks pay off. From each character's trajectory to new characters to new combinations of characters - this movie has it all completely right. The running time was long\\, a little too long (hello\\, first act)\\, but at least every moment had something important happening. Rey is not Luke Skywalker. Luke is not Yoda. Kylo is not Darth Vader. Don't expect a rehash of the initial trilogy. This is something new\\, something different\\, and something wonderful.","true":true}
