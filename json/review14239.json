Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this a 5.5 out of 10. Okay movie but could have been SO much better. Did not even come close to The Force Awakens\\, which I didnt totally love either. Pacing was extremely slow in the first 45 minutes. Goofy side story. Questions people were looking forward to being answered\\, were the worst possible way answered! There were no incredible revelations. It was extremely anti-climatic. The comedy was not well timed or clever at all. Dialogue went in circles. I had no interest in any of the new characters. And Luke's character development was a major disappointment. Only plus to the movie was a few exciting scenes and good acting by a couple of characters.","true":true}
