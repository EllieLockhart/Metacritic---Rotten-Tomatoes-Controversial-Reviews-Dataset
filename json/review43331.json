Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great Star Wars films. I cannot understand why it's only getting 57% audience score. I can only assume it's the same so called \\\"hardcore\\\" fans who loved the prequels at first only to hate them once the rose colored glasses came off. This will go down as one of the best in the series. They are wrong on this just like those who hated Empire at first. The critics have this one right and I don't get to say that a lot.","true":true}
