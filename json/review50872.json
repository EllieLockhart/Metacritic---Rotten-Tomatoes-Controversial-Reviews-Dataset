Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About as successful a continuation of a franchise as \\\"Aliens 3\\\"\\, \\\"Honey\\, I Blew Up the Kid\\\"\\, or \\\"The Lost World\\, Jurassic Park\\\"\\, which is to say\\, a near complete failure.\\nRian Johnson erases 2 years of fan anticipation like the Heat Miser in \\\"The Year Without a Santa Clause\\\". If not for Mark Hamill's performance\\, I don't think this film would have a single redeeming moment. Hamill's Luke is older\\, grizzled\\, and tormented by many of the same fears that put him on the precipice between his father and the emperor in ROTJ. But Rey\\, for absolutely no known or rational reason\\, doesn't bring Luke up to speed with anything resembling the kind of intelligence the character displayed in TFA. Boyega's Finn gives another trademark Han Solo \\\"Wah-hoo\\\"\\, Poe Dameron is still a hot shot pilot who may or may not actively engage in mutiny\\, and anyone without a speaking part is pretty much there just to meet a fiery demise.\\nAs much as George Lucas was maligned for his sometimes difficult and unnatural dialogue\\, especially in the prequels\\, Johnson's characters fail to say anything logical\\, meaningful\\, nor do they move the story forward or accomplish answering any of the questions set up in The Force Awakens. In fact\\, Johnson's entire plan seems to be to erase and destroy most of the plot threads JJ's TFA created.\\nAfter this outing\\, Rian Johnson is about as qualified to write and direct a stand alone Star Wars trilogy as a dustbin full of dryer lint. Reintroducing Jar Jar Binks would have made this movie BETTER. \\nI am the last person to expect Hard science from what has always been space opera\\, but when the McGuffins in TLJ come\\, and boy do they\\, they are so deliberate that they immediately destroy any suspension of disbelief.\\nIf you aren't a fan or don't follow the DisneyXD series Star Wars Rebels\\, then this film will feel new and fresh and surprising. But if you have followed the adventures of the small screens' Ezra Bridges and crew\\, you'd give Johnson an F for plagiarism. \\nIt will take a JJ sized miracle to   distract me from this utter train wreck and get me back in a theater for Episode IX...","true":true}
