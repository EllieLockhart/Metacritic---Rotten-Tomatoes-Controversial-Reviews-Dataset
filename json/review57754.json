Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. This is not a great film at all that is quite worthy of being lumped in with the prequels. To be blunt: It's like someone pulled some poorly written fan fiction off of a blog and used that to script a movie.\\n\\nContrived\\, predictable\\, and disjointed best describe the movie; the only thing missing from this movie that could have made it worse would be an appearance by Jar Jar Binks.\\n\\nUnless you are a die hard Star Wars fan (like me) I recommend avoiding the cinema and waiting for the home video release.","true":true}
