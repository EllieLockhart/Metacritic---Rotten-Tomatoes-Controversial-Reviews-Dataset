Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin. From a critics perspective\\, I can see why this is highly rated. However\\, as a fan\\, it was terrible. The plot and sub plots are bad. The only reason I give it one star is Rey and Kylo really grew as characters. Everything else was bad.","true":true}
