Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics where not very good at what they do...they rarely ever are.\\n\\nThis movie subverted my expectations to the point where I stopped caring about any character's actions....what does it matter if there's some potential \\\"ex machina\\\" right around any corner?\\n\\nMovie's messages are morally ambiguous and their execution makes me want to go enslave animals\\, punch women in power\\, and never have someone fall in love with me\\,\\n\\nThe tone of the movie is...ridiculous. Action suspense scenes are comedic. Dramatic exposition is also undercut by comedy. Was this a live animated cartoon? *dusts shoulder off*.","true":true}
