Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much to see in this movie that 1 viewing isn't enough.  I left the theater after the 1st viewing in total awe\\, but with so many questions rolling through my mind.  After letting everything sink in for a few days I went and saw it again.  I couldn't believe all that I missed.  There are so many little things in this movie from cartoons\\, books\\, etc.  Like many people in real life\\, Luke struggles with his \\\"faith\\\" when something bad happened.  Ultimately\\, he finds his way back to the \\\"light.\\\"  Well done.","true":true}
