Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't waste your time or money going to see it.  The best thing I can say about The Last Jedi is that it is watchable.  Old characters were ruined and new ones are ridiculous.  A 10 year old could write a better story line than this disaster.  I don't think I will pay to see another Star Wars film.","true":true}
