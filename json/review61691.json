The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part II is an impressive\\, deeply moving experience. It is not an easy shot at a sequel\\, it is not a repeat of the first game\\, it is not fan service and for that\\, it deserves praise. It's bold and doesn't take the easy route. It takes elements from the first game\\, and builds upon them\\, having the first one's events directly impact the second one's. That's good story telling.The Last of Us Part II is an impressive\\, deeply moving experience.

It takes elements from the first game\\, and builds upon them\\, having the first one's events directly impact the second one's. That's good story telling. It shows consistency\\, as well as being realistic about characters having grown after an ellipse of four years. As a player\\, it makes you feel about your actions in a way I just haven't seen before.\rAside from the story\\, it's gorgeous\\, the score is incredible and the acting is mind blowing\\, as well as having really good and diverse gameplay. Even if you don't like the story\\, it's a great game that deserves a lot more than a 0\\, and all these reviews only prove that people are rating it with their emotions. Scoring it 0\\, even while acknowledging the undeniable beauty of it\\, is being completely biased. Only real critic from me is the pacing\\, it's a bit long and puts on the breaks a bit too hard in the middle\\, but i'd say it's still worth it in the end.\rAlso\\, I am very glad for the representation of minorities and well-written women in this game\\, not just as support characters but as the main character.\rI'll just conclude by saying that at the very least\\, it validates video games as an art form\\, capable of compelling story telling\\, really beautiful visuals and insanely good acting. Whether you like the story or not is an opinion\\, not a reflection of whether the game is good or bad.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
