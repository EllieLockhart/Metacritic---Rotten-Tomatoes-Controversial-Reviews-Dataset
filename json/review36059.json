Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes Star Wars' fans to new directions. Continuing to new frontiers and to where it was not seen in  previous films. Interactions and character development were there. Small events in the movie however were left unsolved nor touched upon which can leave viewers wondering how it will progress in the final installment of the Sequal trilogy.","true":true}
