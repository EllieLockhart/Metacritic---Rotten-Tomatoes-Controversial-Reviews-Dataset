Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fairly good sequel that genuinely surprised me. I didn't think it would be as Good as it was. It is a mess of a movie\\, but still fun. It had some great action scenes\\, sets\\, and some hilarious moments. It's not what I expected of a Star Wars movie\\, and I think that's a good thing. It allows for a refreshing chapter in a beloved saga. I will definitely see this again.A great sequel to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
