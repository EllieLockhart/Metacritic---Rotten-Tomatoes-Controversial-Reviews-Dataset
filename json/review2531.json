Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A weak addition to the series. The technical aspects of this film are very well done. However\\, the writing\\, the direction\\, and the story are atrocious. This film carries the star wars name\\, but lacks a soul and does not feel like a star wars film at all. It fails completely in building upon the previous film and does minimal to improve upon already weak character development from the force awakens. I would not recommend this film.","true":true}
