{"101487":116492,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney needs to remake Episode 8\\, I. AM. NOT. JOKING.\\nAnd 92% critic rating PROVES that they are all bought and paid for. In fact I'd go so far to say even the audience score is still too high and Disney is probably buying 5 star scores to prop this trash. \\nLuke Skywalker's character is completely fucked up\\, even Mark Hamill admitted this. He spent the entire original trilogy fighting to save his father just because he saw a tiny glimmer of goodness in him\\, and you want me to believe he would then attempt to kill Kylo Ren HIS NEPHEW because he saw he might turn to the dark side?!?! WTF??\\nCantina Bight (how original) scene was totally unnecessary\\, it's 30 mins of watching anti capitalist propaganda (how ironic coming from Disney). \\nThe last Jedi actually also renders the first movie TFA redundant\\, because they spent that movie searching for the missing map piece to find Luke Skywalker\\, anyway it turned out R2D2 had it\\, BUT it was Luke Skywalker who put it there!?!? If he's such a rude asshole in TLJ and doesn't want to teach any more Jedi then WHY DID HE MAKE A MAP FOR PEOPLE TO COME FIND HIM?!?! Fucking Rian Johnston and his plotholes. \\n\\nOther scenes that annoyed me:\\nIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADMIRAL ACKBAR THAT DESTROYED THE DREADNOUGHT WITH THE HYPERDRIVE!!!!\\nNot kill him off screen\\, and then give the role to some hunger games lady who then decides not to tell the crew her plan to evacuate to the planet\\, which by not doing so leads to the POINTLESS cantina bight scenes\\, and subsequent destruction of the rebel fleet. FFS who were the scriptwriters on this???\\nLeia SHOULD HAVE DIED! It would have been more fitting end for her if she passed along with her brother Luke\\, and allowed the rebels to escape or something.\\nAlso WHAT ARE THE MOTIVATIONS BEHIND REY ???\\nShe has NO fight for this in her story\\, whats her motivation to join the Jedi? What's her reasoning to do anything\\, she doesn't know Kylo Ren or Han Solo yet she's apparently so emotionally connected to them. \\nKylo Renn\\, starts off good\\, then turns evil\\, then becomes good again\\, then becomes evil once more\\, WHAT?? What is his motivation to turn evil? That his parents didn't love him enough?? :\/\\nTHERE\\\"S NO MOTIVATION FOR THESE CHARACTERS!!!!!\\n\\nIt's not that the Star Wars community are against change\\, but if YOUR GOING TO DO A REMAKE OF A NEW HOPE = THE FORCE AWAKENS AND THE LAST JEDI = THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. BECAUSE THATS WHAT THEY ARE! REMAKES!!!\\nWe're not against change BUT DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT! Leave the Rebels\/Empire conflict to the ORIGINALS because you will fail trying to replicate it. Even the terrible prequels did something right by not trying to replicate the originals they have their own unique conflict with unique factions. \\nINSTEAD:\\nI suggest to Disney REMAKE episode 8\\, get J.J. Abrams to do it. TFA was a good movie\\, it started out solid. For episode 8 however\\, have the war between the resistance and first order except introduce a new villain faction \\\"THE YUUZAHN VONG\\\"\\, and it would MAKE THE FIRST ORDER AND RESISTANCE UNITE to defend the galaxy against this new threat. it would have competing ideologies working together and sometimes against each other and would make for a much more interesting trilogy. Then have Snoke or something be the Sith Lord behind the invasion\\, or surprise us and make the Sith and the Jedi be forced to work together! IDK.\\nJUST DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.","true":true}
