Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action sequences were phenomenal. The character development picked up from the last move and pushes us towards the next. The subplots helped to expand the Star Wars universe. The twists were fantastic and unexpected. Overall a great film.","true":true}
