Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok I know a lot of people hated TLJ but I enjoyed it for what it was. I like that they tossed your expectations out the window. I did not like Lukes wallowing in self pity but his final fight made up for it. I like that Kylo did not turn to the light because I am not over him killing Han. I also agree that the Canto Bight scenes were unnecessary. I think they should take the less is more approach lesson to heart for the next film. Also they missed an opportunity to write Carrie Fishers character out of the story in a way that made sense and not have her miraculously survive hard vacuum.","true":true}
