Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not my favorite Star Wars movie by any means\\, this new chapter in the saga does give us the background and motivation needed for each of the key players heading into the final episode. Much like Empire Strikes Back\\, it leaves us with a slew of problems and a glimmer of hope\\, but it is enjoyable as long as you you let yourself be entertained by characters we love. ","true":true}
