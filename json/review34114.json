Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TFA made us love Star Wars again\\, TLJ\\, makes us say goodbye to the past and get ready for the future. I recommend reading spoilers\\, you will enjoy the journey instead of fixating on the surprises. I will see it again\\, way to much to absorb even having read spoilers.","true":true}
