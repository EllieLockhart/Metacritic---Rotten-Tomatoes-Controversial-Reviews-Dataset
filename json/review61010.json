But the gameplay isn\u2019t what causes this game to be a failure in my opinion\\, because that\u2019s not what people really play TLOU for anyways. People play for the characters and story\\, which is nothing short of disappointing and misguided in this game. The utter lack of respect toward previous or even new characters prevents the player from getting invested in them\\, and the game fails to utilize the one relationship the player was already invested in going into the game. Instead they demolish that relationship\\, and never really show it getting back to anything of what it used to be. Most other characters in this game are stagnant and replaceable\\, and while they have good performances\\, fail to make me care about them in a meaningful way. That is\\, until they get brutally murdered on a quest for revenge. By the end of the game I was so numb to violence nothing shocked me anymore\\, and I\u2019m not sure what the game was even trying to say through all this violence and misery. What I do know is that I feel devastated for Ellie and deep hatred for another character. I truly hope Naughty Dog lets this franchise die in the pit they dug for it. I absolutely loved the first game\\, but this train wreck wants me to feel depressed for nothing. Some of the lessons it tries to teach seem so stupidly simple I asked myself if I was even hearing it right. All I can hear now is the ringing in my ears after listening to one of my favorite games get pillaged and massacred in the name of \u201cSubverted Expectations\u201d. Do not recommend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
