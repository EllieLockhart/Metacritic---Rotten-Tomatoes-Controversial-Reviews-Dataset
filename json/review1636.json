Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As always the movie is visually stunning but the positive sides of TLJ pretty much end up there. I really don't understand how critics can praise TLJ especially since they managed to gloss over plot holes that are huge as the Death Star! The movie had great potential but Johnson managed to choose the wrong turn every time. New useless characters have been introduced at the expense of already existing (and good) ones. The development of Rey\\, Finn\\, Kylo and Luke is managed in a very naive way just like you'll find it in a fan fiction written by a 14 years old girl. Humor is misplaced and very \\\"Joss Whedony\\\". There's too much use of red herring\\, pretty much everything that was set up in TFA is gone in a few seconds that leaves you with the sensation of having watch a story in wich choices were random. And then the ultimate sin\\, the death of Luke\\, the only character that seems worth watching in this universe of Mary Sue\\, unconvincing villains and attention seeker heroes.","true":true}
