Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horrible.  Nothing but SJW trash that failed to build on the 'force awakens' story.  Tons of preaching\\, very little entertainment value\\, and just painful for anyone who has been following the franchise.","true":true}
