Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some of the same plot holes and cheesy moments that have always been a part of SW\\, but this installment delivers a third act that is absolutely incredible. I've seen it twice and can't wait for the third time. Thanks to Rogue One and The Last Jedi we finally have shades of gray in a beloved franchise historically too neatly divided by pure good and absolute evil. I love this movie because of its tough\\, controversal direction\\, not in spite of it. It includes plenty of memberberries\\, but takes some bold steps that are exactly what the saga needed for the long-term.","true":true}
