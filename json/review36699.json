Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is too long and not interesting in a lot of spots. The humor is awkward and badly timed. Its more like a parody of a Star Wars movie.Self aware humor in a Star Wars movie? No thanks. New force powers are invented just to get characters out of troubling situations. And last and most important Luke Skywalker is absolutely ruined in this movie. If you held him dear DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE it ruins everything good about him.  Which in turns takes away everything he does in the orginal trilogy if this is his story arc. Its an absolute shame. Plus with everything that transpires in this movie theres no point in seeing the 3rd. You'd have to be pretty dense to not realize how this is going to end now. Myself personally I have no interest in Star Wars anymore after this movie.","true":true}
