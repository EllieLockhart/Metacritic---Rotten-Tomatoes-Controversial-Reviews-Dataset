Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly the first of the entire Star Wars franchise to leave a bad taste in my mouth. I'd watch the Holiday Special 10 times before ever watching this garbage again. \\n\\nJJ Abrams did so well with Episode VII. He set up Episode VIII perfectly. He set it up to where this Sequel Trilogy could end the SKYWALKER Saga with elegance. Caps on Skywalker because this story is the Skywalker's. Unfortunately\\, Rian Johnson didn't give us that. He gave Luke a shitty death\\, Rey a lineage that doesn't have anything to do with the Skywalker family and a drawn out film that had more plot holes than plot. And\\, Snoke? What the hell was that? \\n\\nHalf a star was too much to give for this movie that I'm sad to even call part of the Star Wars franchise. Sorry for the emo Kylo rant\\, but all true.","true":true}
