Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess the new generation of jedi don't need any training to be jedi masters. They can automatically know how to use the force\\, and be an expert with light sabers if they just believe in themselves. Just a movie full of Mary Sue's.","true":true}
