Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People who are saying its perfect or flawless are tripping. and people who think its less then a 6 are also trippin. there are some  superfluous  characters and a subplot that is completely unnecessary. but besides that....its everything youd want in a star wars movie. the acting has never been better the light saber duels are FIRE. the pacing is hurt by the sub plot i mentioned earlier but the overall experience it still good for any true star wars fan. its a little darker then most star wars so it mite turn some people off. they also try to balance with comic relive but i feel it was slightly overplayed at times. over all a good movie.","true":true}
