Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a mess. It's very confusing and boring at the same time. You don't know why things happen and it's really not entertaining at the same time. 80% of the characterdesigns feel forced cause of SJW idiology. i can't connect with the film because every single emotional moment feels to cheap for me to appreciate.","true":true}
