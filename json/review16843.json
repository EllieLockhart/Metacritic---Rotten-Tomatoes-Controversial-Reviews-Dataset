Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Insulting to the intelligence of the audience and even MORE insulting to anyone who respected the impact that a consistent universe had on the Star Wars franchise. A blind attempt to subvert expectations without any redemption.","true":true}
