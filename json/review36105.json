Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a great addition to be sequel trilogy. It wasn't perfect\\, but for most Star Wars fans nothing will be as \\\"perfect\\\" as the original trilogy. The bad reviews are coming from picky Star Wars fans that are upset it didn't go exactly the way they wanted. The Force Awakens was \\\"too safe\\\" and \\\"too similar\\\" but now the Last Jedi is \\\"too different\\\". Nothing will ever satisfy. With that being said\\, it's a great movie ton sit back and enjoy. It should stop being compared so closely to the original trilogy. Yes there should be similar elements\\, and yes Star Wars shouldn't strive away from their roots. The Last Jedi has familiar elements while also making it its own unique movie. It was much better than Force Awakens in my opinion.","true":true}
