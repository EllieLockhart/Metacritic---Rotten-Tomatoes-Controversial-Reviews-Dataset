Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best part of the film was the secrecy. I have been watching countless youtube fan theory videos and supposed leaked information for two years. All of it hogwash! Hardly anyone was right. Even all the marketing was a complete misdirect. Or is it something bigger? Is there more to the story? Last Jedi feels more like a new beginning rather than a middle of the story. If they wrap it up in one more episode its going to feel pretty weak. However if this thing gets expanded to an episode 10\\, 11\\, 12 then this is a fresh start with Rey as the new Jedi and Kylo as a budding baddy. Overall I think I loved it. The dissapointment was it met ZERO of my expectations because of how many freaking people on the internet were just flat out wrong! cracks me up - go see the movie and forget everything you think you know and accept it for what it is and its wonderful.","true":true}
