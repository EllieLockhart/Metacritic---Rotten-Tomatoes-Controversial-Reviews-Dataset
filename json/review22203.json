Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lack of Structure\\, Basically ignores the previous films build up\\, full of basic stupid plot holes. Ignores many things that make a Star Wars film. SJW & politically driven motives rather than the want that should go into producing a good film. When the director himself blanket rejects all criticism as unfounded you know things are bad. As a long-term star wars fan it made me come out of showing hating star wars.","true":true}
