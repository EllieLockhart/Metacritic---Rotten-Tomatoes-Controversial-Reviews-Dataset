Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroys cannon\\, removes pivotal characters for seaming no reason. Heavy fem agenda\\, so much so that it creates plot holes\\, more than can be counted. Visuals were as expected\\, amazing. Music and audio\\, first rate. Al actors across the board were solid. Just a bad bad story line.","true":true}
