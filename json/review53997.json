{"101487":129671,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am truly confused why fans are so upset by this movie. First off let me say I've been a Star Wars fan since I saw A New Hope in 1977 (yes I'm old lol). THIS HAS SPOILERS!!!!!!   Don't get me wrong\\, the last jedi isn't perfect\\, it has its flaws. Canto Bight being a big one\\, and Prncess Leia poppins (which after the second viewing\\, was easier to except). But the biggest complaints I'm hearing and reading are 4 things......Rey is a nobody\\, Snoke has no back story\\, and that's not the Luke we grew up with... and last plot holes.  So let's start with Rey\\, why are you upset she is a nobody?  Most Jedi come from nowhere. Who are Kenobi' s\\, Yoda's\\,  Windu's.... etc. parents???? It doesn't matter. People wanted Luke to be her father\\, so being a dead beat dad is ok\\, but not someone who gave up on the force? (I will get to that later) The point of Rey being a nobody is that greatness comes from with in\\, not a bloodline. It's like saying you can only be rich of your parents are rich.... REALLY????. Moving on.... Snoke has no back story. The Emperor had no back story until the prequels. He was just some old guy that was the ruled the Empire period. 3rd...not the Luke we grew up with.  Ok I agree 100%.... but let's think about this. His aunt and uncle were burnt alive\\, his mentor was killed in front of him\\, his other mentor died after telling him he had a sister\\, his father cut off his hand and tried to kill him....them watched his father die in front of him....then watched his nephew go to the darkside......yeah I would say\\\"F\\\" the force too after all of that as well. Or does that not form a person\\, they just always be happy go lucky? And oh by the way\\, didnt Yoda run away and hide as well? Last but not least plot holes. OMG have you seen the original trilogy? It was pretty much based on plot holes. Luke making out with his sister\\,  Luke almost defeating Vader after a few flips and lifting rocks with Yoda. Kenobi and Yoda pretty much redcon almost every plot in A New Hope and Empire? These are all reasons this makes Star wars great. I'm really sorry that your Snoke is Jar Jar didn't pan out\\, or Rey was born from a seed of a force tree... those all would have made the movie better ??. At the end of the day\\, was this a different Star Wars movie\\, 100% yes.  And that's why it is soooo good. Get off YouTube for spoilers or theories\\, and just enjoy the amazing creation that is The Last Jedi !!!!","true":true}
