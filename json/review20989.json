Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was looking forward to this based upon the early buzz. I am a big sci-fi fan and this is better than most other Star Wars flicks. However I was so disappointed in the many script flaws and implausible story line in the horrible script. They portray the lead Rebellion pilot as a hot head while the 3 female leaders kee a secret ploy from this guy. Yet his actions help save them in some tough spots. Then how could the General (Princess) survive? I am not an idiot so continuing. How did Rae get to the Falcon? What about the cloaking strategy and how could it fail? Then who was left to fight when most of their pods were shot down? This was a hacked movie. Save your money (I spend $20 on IMAX 3D) and honestly there were maybe a total of 10 minutes worthy of wearing the glasses... good luck next time!","true":true}
