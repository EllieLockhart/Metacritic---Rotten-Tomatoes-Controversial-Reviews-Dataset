Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"aFTER the disappointment of the force awakens\\, i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the last jedi. the story went in directions that i didn't expect\\, and i found that refreshing. it made me question\\, what i thought i knew about the force\\, and the jedi\\, and about the destinies of my favorite characters. I want these movies to keep surprising me\\, and challenging my ideas about how things should go. I know that this is not the popular opinion\\, and that it's been a bridge too far\\, for many fans\\, but i was pleased with this movie. i look forward to seeing where the story goes\\, from here. two thumbs way up!","true":true}
