Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was this the worst Star Wars movie ever\\, it is one of the worst movies I've seen in the past 5 years...probably more.\\n\\nSo much garbage abound in this movie.  Luke tossing his \\\"laser sword\\\"...garbage.  Rose Tico...garbage.  Flying Leia...garbage.  Rey's backstory (or lack of one)...garbage.  Snoke's demise....garbage.\\n\\nSkip this movie.  And the next one too.","true":true}
