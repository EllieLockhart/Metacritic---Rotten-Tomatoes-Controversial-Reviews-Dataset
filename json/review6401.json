Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney screwed up one of the most beloved sagas of my childhood.\\nI liked:\\n* Nice photography.\\n* Old school special effects (like old saga)\\nI hated:\\n* Too many jokes.\\n* Too politically correct (feminism\\, animalism\\, .\\n* Too many \\\"cute animals\\\".\\n* Humiliated and low credible villains.\\n* \\\"All old must die\\\" message is disgusting and dangerous for children.\\n* They made beloved saga characters like Luke\\, Leia\\, Yoda and even Chewie do things so contradictory and stupid that made them unrecognizable.\\n\\nIn summary\\, while Episode VII was just a copy of IV\\, episode VIII copied V and VI and took a shitload on the story and killed it beyond any hope to fix it in next episode.\\n\\nRIP Star Wars","true":true}
