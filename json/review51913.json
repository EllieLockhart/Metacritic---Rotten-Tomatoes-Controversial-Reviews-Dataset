{"101487":99603,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that seems to try to appeal to all audiences and fufill fan expectation as its own new story that will replace the former films\\, in every aspect it falls flat on its face.\\n\\nSpoiler Free\\nA majority of the sub plots are extremely pointless not to mention the main story which is utterly flawed and full of plot holes. As Star Wars is a \\\"Science Fiction\\\" some liberties can be taken with the ideas of space and technology but is taken way to far with all the odd occurances where physics should play in. Mega fans pf the Clone Wars and Original Trilogy will be baffeled and almost insulted with how the characters and ideas from the George Lucas films are handled\\, I do believe fans of the Force Awakens  and Marvel films will like this movie. I personally just cannot recommend this mpvie to anyone and would much rather have the three hours I spent with it back. Phantom Menace>Last Jedi\\, sums up how I percieve the movie is\\, 2\/10 for impressive visuals.\\n\\n*Spoilers!* Cons\\n1. How the First order conquered the entire Galaxy escapes me as this film tales place right after the Force Awakens ends. Why the Resistance is losing when they destroyed Star Killer base os just lazy writing to replicate the Rebels and Emipre struggle.\\n2. Consiquences from the first film in this trilogy have been negated. Finn is absolutely fine and knows have to pilot a space craft now while being unconsious? The First Prder already has a massive battle fleet despite the fact that they only has Star Killer base and one star destroyer that we ever saw. Kylo Ren's scar has moved slightly down from his face. The most offensive of all is that absolutely nothing is given in respect or memory for Han Solo\\, just a quick bit of dialogue with Luke who doesn't care that his best friend died; even Quigon Jin had a funeral and he was in one Star Wars movie.\\n3. Rey still remains a huge Mary Sue that can do anything with zero amount of training from anyone\\, Luke does not train her at all except for a \\\"lesson\\\" which was him saying maybe five minutes about the force and then refusing to ever teach her anything. Her lineage was also revealed\\, perhaps something to uncover why she is so good at everything\\, perhaps her parents were someone powerful in the force? Nope\\, she is literally the child of somw random nobodies. Sometimes that would be considered good writing because sometimes greatness comes from no where\\, but when you set it up like her family was somebody important in the previous film it begs the question only for The Last Jedi ttcto slap you in the face for ever coming up with a plausable explanation. I also inderstand some people defending it with saying that Kylo Ren could be making it up but Rey is the one that says it so that would be kind of hard to swallow.\\n4. Leia. As a touchy subject I figured going in to see this movie would have to kill her off as Carie Fisher is sadly not with us anymore and the film tricks you into believing that as the command deck that she is on with Ackbar\\, who is also killed in this film uncerimoniasly\\, is hit with some explosion and flushes them into the vacuum of space. The camera lingers uncomfortably on Leia for a good amount of time making the scene incredibly awkward when suddenly her hand twitches\\, her eyes open\\, and she (no joke\\, this is in the movie) Marie Poppins flies her way through space back to the Resistance ship only to fall into a coma. That was one of the stupidest scenes I have ever seen in a Star Wars movie\\, it is never explained or talked about despite the fact she wakes up later and no one questions it.\\n5. Finn and Rose\\, Rose being a new character in the series is introduced with a meh entrance as she mourns the lose of her sister and teams up with Finn to find a master code breaker to help get the First Order off the Resistance fleet's tail as they are able to track them through hyper space. This has to be one of the most boring sub plots in a movie ever as it was nothing more than showing off a weird political message about how money is bad and animal cruelty is also bad\\, it felt nothing like Star Wars. They hace to go to a casino on some planet to find this guy and I swear that they walked onto the set of The Fifth Element and just kept filming for about half an hour. The film grinds to a halt as we learn about things that no one could care less about. They get thrown in jail because they parked their ship on a beach(?) and happen to find a code breaker in jail who agrees to help\\, he later betrays them instead and successfully makes the sub plot utterly pointless and dumb with no satisfying conclusion. During the climax Rose also becomes an insuffirable character as she says a line stupider than\\, \\\"I hate sand\\,\\\" and ruins what would have been a cool end for Finn because she fell in love with him in less than 18 hours. LAZY. WRITING.\\n6. Luke Skywalker\\, dear God. By far ranking as my second favorite jedi of all time right under Obi Wan and just above Mast Plo Koon is completely shit upon as his character arc makes a complete 360 and he seems to have forgot all his development in the original Star Wars. He already seems off with his very first scene as Rey gives him the blue light saber\\, his firsr lightsaber given to him by his mentor Obi Wan\\, belonging to his father Anakin Skywalker\\, and lost down a huge pit in the Empire Strikes Back\\, instead of a heart felt emotional scene it is traded for a terrible laugh as he throws it over his shoulder. He created Kylo Ren because he was going to kill him for seeing darkness in his future\\, Luke Skywalker refused to kill his own father because he believed he could turn him good yet he though killing his teenage nephew was the answer to someone conflicted between the light and dark? What!? Instead of fixing the menace he just created he decides to hide like a coward and wait for his death on some remote island on a back water planet\\, this goes against his character again as we know Luke as a hero who would come to his friends aid even if he knew there was no possible way to win against unbeatable odds. Also\\, why would he give them a map if he wanted to die a coward\\, it is never explained. The biggest insult is his death\\, yes\\, he dies at the end of the movie. As the Resistance is hiding in a large base on a salt planet (knock off Hoth) and the first order is coming in\\, Luke arrives to hold off their escape\\, he is blasted with thousands of lasers which he survives miracuosly and faces Kylo weilding the blue lightsaber\\, this was already fishy as Kylo Ren was the one who helped break it in the first place! Luke is sliced by Kylo but the blade passes thrpugh him as if he was not there. Luke is projecting himself from across the Galaxy using the force\\, a force power never explained\\, explored\\, or ever brought up as being a force power just like flying through space was. I thought to myself\\, \\\"okay\\, that was clever\\\" only to be slapped for my stupidety as Luke finishes projecting\\, watches twin suns set\\, and fades away into thin air to become a fprce ghost. What in the actual Hell!?!?!?! If he was actually going to be killed why not have him actually come to their rescue?! Luke Skywalker\\, perhaps one of the most iconic heroes in all of pop culture dies a coward hiding on some outer rim world\\, this was an insult to every fan of his character and Mark Hamill who even himself critizied it which I believe is his genuine feeling and he was forced to apologize for speaking out.\\n7. Adimral Holdo\\, the leader of the Resistance who is brought in during Leia's coma is prpbavly one of the worst leaders of an army I have ever seen. The Resistance fleet is fleeing from the First Order Armada who should easily catch up to them with easy manuvuers like light speeding ahead of them but instead chooses to bombard the flagship\\, Holdo's plan is too not tell the remaining 400 crew members and Resistance soldiers left what the plan is until plot demands it\\, leading to a mutiny that she couldn't even handle without Leia waking from her coma and dealing with it herself. Her actual plan is no better anyways as she is fueling the transports so they can escape the doomed flagship which is a dumb idea as the transports have no shields and will be easily shot down\\, which they are. She does have a sacrafice scene which admitably is visual impressive but silly as you wonder why she did it instead I don't know LEIA or ACKBAR!? Leia has to die and that was Ackbar's ship.\\n8. Snoke\\, my last major critisism that I will say so I can end this lllloooonnnngggg review is how Snoke is killed. I can honestly say that I know absolutely nothing about this character and won't ever because now the main badguy of Disney Star Wars is Kylo Ren because the strange force user Snoke (not sure if he is a jedi\\, sith\\, or grey jedi\\, it is never said) who proves himself to be so immensely power with the force that he can do things from the other side of the galaxy is killed because he couldn't sense or hear Kylo Ren manipulating a lightsaber on the table right FRICKEN next to him to sturn on and cut him in half. That should have been used later as that was utterly pointpess and made his character equally pointoess and stupid.\\n\\nPros (a short list)\\n1. Visually this movie does have some great imagry and vision. The island Luke is on is beautiful beside from the disgusting nipple monster and Disney's marketing sceme\\, I mean Porg which funnily enough are never called Porgs in the movie. The Casino town is equally lovelly and Holdo's sacrafice is interesting.\\n2. Kylo Ren is the only character with a sembilance of a character arc which makes him the most relatable and growing character that by the end of the film you just can't help but cheer for the bag guys to win over the uninteresting good guys.\\n\\nOverall\\nHumor is very poor in a movie that should be serious as that is how they wanted it to be taken\\, plot is all completely laughable as it must have either been writin in hatred of Star Wars or absolutely no respect for everything the previous movies had done\\, dialogue is terribly cliche and moronic\\, cinamotography and cgi is decent and could possibly rival with other films such as Blade Runner 2049 (a very good movie all around)\\, characters are so generic and boring that you could care absolutely nothing for the next movie. The conclusion ends with what I thought was a commercial to sell toys to children that I thought I was halucinating until I asked my girlfriend. This felt nothing like a Star Wars film that I believe would be bashed by critics if you too away the name of Star Wars and Disney\\, I honestly do not know why it is rated so high for people who are suppose to be nit picky about movie. I can honestly only say that at best this is a 2 out of 10\\, it insults any fans intelligence and makes the vast lore of the universe more small and shallow than ever before\\, I can only recommend not watching it and only seeing it once it goes on sale cheap or a dollar at a redbox.","true":true}
