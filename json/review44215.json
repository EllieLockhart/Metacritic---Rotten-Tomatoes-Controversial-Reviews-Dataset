Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too bad there were probably some really talented people that worked on this. They deserve mad credit....\\nBut this movie was very painful to watch at times. I got major Ep1-3 flashbacks throughout. 3 hours and hardly any progress in story or character developement. Very very disney childish. This movie will not hold up with time.\\n\\nNo interest to see Episode 9.","true":true}
