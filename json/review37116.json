Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was better than the Force Awakens because it at least had its own story.  However\\, the story is what makes it so terrible.  SPOILERS: This movie continues Hollywood's war on males.  I have no problem with strong female leads but this movie actively attacks males.  Between it and Force Awakens they kill off the two good male characters.  The two male \\\"good guys\\\" who are still with us are Po and Fin and what do they do?  They go off on a fools errand (Po stays on the ship but he is the leader) that not only fails but makes things worse.  I'm done with Star Wars.  I'm done with Disney.  I'm done with Hollywood.  Wake me up when they learn to make good movies again that are something better than a platform for their politics.","true":true}
