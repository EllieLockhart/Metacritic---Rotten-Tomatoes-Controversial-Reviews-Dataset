Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a steaming pile of garbage. It took what could of been great and shit all over it. The forced theme that WOMEN are the only possible saviors for everyone is just retarded and i'm not even the type of person to have an issue with a strong female lead\\, but this is just force fed SJW Trash. They wasted Luke\\, Rey\\, Finn and Poe are BORING. Rose should just die. Why even go to the Casino planet? Oh\\, to get all your friends killed. But it was totally worth it to free those horse monsters who will just be captured as soon as you leave right? Just...why\\, Rein Johnson or wtf ever his name is should NEVER be allowed to head a block buster movie for the rest of his career. Worst Starwars Ever\\, even worse than the Prequels. I wish George Lucas would just reshoot the entire movie and re-release it next year\\, and it would be less trash. Don't waste your time. Crylo Ren is on the verge of being a decent character and then isn't. So SO SO SO DISAPPOINTING. The critics reviewing this are Hillary supporting dumbocrats jerking off to all the \\\"Female Power!\\\" makes me want to puke.","true":true}
