Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok this is the worst star wars film i have ever seen\\, rhe director took a big shit on everything that made the originals great\\, total disrespect to clasic characters\\, absurd jokes\\, shitty plot lines\\, its like a mix of every movie but worst.\\n\\nI wonder if Disney chooses directora only based on their willingness to kill of the old characters\\, literally everyone is dead as of this movie.\\n\\nYou could have given us the Luke Skywalker we deserved but you decided to erase him (also literally) wtf! Now that Carrie Fisher has passed away\\, you could have at least leave Luke alone for one more movie.\\n\\nSo dissapointed and angry at thi\\, wtf is up with the 94% srating?","true":true}
