Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure what movie the critics saw\\, but I think it was very different than the one that I was subjected to. The special effects and camera work are some of the best ever in a science fiction movie. However\\, the plot and story - and what little dialogue there is - seem like they went with the first draft. (Edit: It turns out this was actually true\\, unfortunately.) I had never walked out of a Star Wars movie feeling so overtly disappointed. Not only are celebrated characters\\, subplots\\, the build-up of the previous movie all senselessly thrown away\\, but their replacements are thinner than an army of CGI soldiers. This episode of the greatest movie series of all time ends...with a kid and a broom? No wonder this movie had the greatest drop in the box office between the first and second weeks of release in motion picture history. Not only a disappointment\\, not only a missed opportunity\\, but the senseless discarding of decades of stories for nothing in return. The world would be a better place if it had not been made and we were still waiting for a sequel\\, or none at all.","true":true}
