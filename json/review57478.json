Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen and I am disappointed that it is even associated with Star Wars. The original characters have been thrown in the trash\\, and all mysterious questions were answered too plainly. There was no \\\"ah HA!\\\" moment ever\\, and don't even get me started on the completely unfunny and horribly-timed jokes. At least in Rogue One\\, I'll admit I chuckled after a few of K-2SO's comments. I wanted to sink in my chair and disappear forever or throw up then walk out after the first space battle. I actually found myself embarrassed by the movie and angry that original characters were completely disregarded or changed. The \\\"cool\\\" parts of the movie made me squint in confusion and disgust because they just don't make sense. I saw this over the weekend\\, and I am still angry. I literally don't know if I can force myself to watch this ever again. This was a very bad movie. It is perfect for the Sci-Fi channel at 3AM. I should also note that this was my first movie review. I felt so angry that I needed to make an account here and warn the world.","true":true}
