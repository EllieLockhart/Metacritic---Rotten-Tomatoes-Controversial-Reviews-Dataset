Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film\\, while visually stunning\\, lacks substance and meaningful character development. The storytelling is atrocious\\, and many elements of the film contradict existing star wars cannon. The talented actors\/actresses in this film were wasted due to shoddy writing\\, as the director seems to value style over substance. \\n\\nIt truly baffles me that people can enjoy this film and I genuinely don't understand why this film is rated so highly by 'critics'.","true":true}
