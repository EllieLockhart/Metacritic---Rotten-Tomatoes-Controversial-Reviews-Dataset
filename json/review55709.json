Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the main premises in the Last Jedi is that death must occur in order for life to spring from the ashes.  Consequently the director feels justified in trashing the legacy of the beloved characters that originally brought this universe to life.  The new characters are particularly stunted by poor writing that never allows them to grow through adversity or become compelling heroes apart from the shoulders they stand on.  Even stranger is how the film makers build upon and yet subsequently trample feelings of nostalgia with their use of cinematic elements and script.  In the end\\, the audience is left with no consolation for the two and half hours they wasted watching everything they loved about Star Wars slowly and systematically decomposing.","true":true}
