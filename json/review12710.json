Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could see how the nerd boys would be upset with the movie.  Their storynexpectations did not come true.  However\\, it was much funnier than I expected.  There were plot elements that I did not expect.  I left the theater with some big questions for the next episode.  I enjoyed the movie greatly.","true":true}
