Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest episode of the Star Wars felt like there's no overarching storyline for the trilogy. The Force Awakens felt like a rehash but set up nicely to this series. Then pretty much shot down all of the questions. There's also a lot of inappropriate jokes and gags that doesn't rhyme to the overall tone of the movie. There are also so many scenes that doesn't make sense like the one with Leia flying and Luke dying without explanation.  Lastly\\, its just a very long movie with no payoff at the end. Its such sad that Star Wars have fallen this low in terms of storytelling.","true":true}
