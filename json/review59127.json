Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"this game is all about the story because the game play is very shallow. its basically a ps3 style exploration action game straight out of 2012. Even uncharted has better game play because at least there is puzzles in that. this is just explore\\, look for ammo\\, gun fight\\, rinse and repeat with nothing new and stupid AI to boot. there is also no real skill tree because you can play the wholethis game is all about the story because the game play is very shallow. its basically a ps3 style exploration action game straight out of 2012.

I'm all for revenge but its just been done a million times and weak. the main problem with this game though is that so many reviewers have given it 10 out of 10. there is no way even if you are fan of this style of game and this series that this is a ten its a 8 at most mostly for the fact that the game play is so stale\\, exploration is like a 10 year old game with invisible walls of grass or vines everywhere\\, you can even jump on cars or anything they haven't scripted which is just lazy game world making for a exploration game there is very little to explore as its all just open air wall corridors on one level. Its like a game from the early 2000's. So how can you give it a 10 that is just poor journalism. another Massive problem with the game is that the level design is so linear and basic its just not acceptable for even a indie game let alone something with this budget in 2020. In the age of Dark souls\\, Bloodbourne\\, Tomb Raider and Jedi Fallen order we have a game which sends you down tiny little paths with invisible walls of vines\\, come ON! and they are giving it a 10\/10. I don't understand those reviews\\, they must be scared if reviewing it poorly other wise they might think people would think they are anti LGBT\\, and the whole gay thing is way overplayed on this they make such big deal about it\\, instead of treating it with respect and just being normal about it instead they hinge whole story arcs on it.  Graphics and sound are really good but its not enough carry it through the rubbish game play and story\\, probably wouldn't rate it so low\\, but the 10's are lies so here is a 2\u2026 Expand","true":true}
