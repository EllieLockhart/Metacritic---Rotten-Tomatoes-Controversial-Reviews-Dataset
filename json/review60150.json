The review bombing for this game is unwarranted\\, as most give it '0' simply because they didn't like the story\\, or haven't even finished the game. There are controversial narrative choices sure\\, but the experience is better for it.\r\rThis is no hero game. There is no 'good vs evil'. It's about humanity in its most desperate of times and what people are capable of doing when pushed to their limits with their emotions and minds. Outside of the marmite story\\, the rest of the game is at the top of its class in all other areas\\, so giving it a low score because of the story feels like a disservice to all of the hard work the developers have put in to create such a wonderful masterpiece of a world that feels eerily real.\r\rI for one LOVED the story. Without spoiling anything\\, the game takes an interesting narrative direction during the game\\, which I have seen no other game do and while some people don't like this\\, I think it's brilliant. It really makes you focus on the core themes the story is dealing with and makes you question your own morality.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
