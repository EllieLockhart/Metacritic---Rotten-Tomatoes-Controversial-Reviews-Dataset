Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is ruined by several decisions. Setups from the previous films are never paid off and the director seems to get some kind of sexual gratification by telling the audience to go F themselves at every opportunity he gets. Fans of star wars will be very dissapointed. \\nThere are some superbly shot scnes but they can't overcome the terrible plot decisions and marketing gimmicks. New characters are brought in\\, but fail to really add anything to the Star Wars universe. To make matters worse\\, emotional pay offs from previous films\\, and even ones in this film\\, never come to throughition. Many characters are wasted. A wonderful way to send Leia off was wasted for what can only be described as the weirdest scene outside of The Room in Hollywood. \\nAt times the CG was terrible.\\nI don't get what the critics saw that fans didn't","true":true}
