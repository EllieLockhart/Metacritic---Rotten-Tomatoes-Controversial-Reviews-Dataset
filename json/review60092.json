The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let\u2019s start off with this: anyone who saw the leaks and formed an opinion of the game based primarily on that content should NOT be listened to when it comes to rating this game. People do not understand where Druckmann took the story because they were stuck in TLOU 1. But before I get into the why\u2019s and how\u2019s of this game\\, let\u2019s talk about gameplay.GAMEPLAYYou will have anxiety attacks. The combat mechanics and refined and impactful. Your ammo runs out fast\\, the AI is smart\\, the environments are open-ended enough for ballsy trigger-fingers or sneaky ninjas. The infected are menacing\\, with a touch more humanity than the previous game. You really do have to think before you act. There are insane action scenes as well as soft\\, well-paced moments of carefully crafted exposition. GRAPHICSIt\u2019s Naughty Dog. CHARACTERSThis is where the game shined to me. Every character is three dimensional. Who is bad? Who is good? You can\u2019t tell. That is the point. In the context of this tired\\, fungus-ridden post-apocalypse\\, there is no good and evil; there is people and the extent they\u2019ll go to survive and protect. Ellie progresses through the story losing her humanity and becoming more like\\, you guessed it\\, Joel. Abby is a misunderstood victim: Joel took everything from her. The characters all put in what they need to\\, but they don\u2019t necessarily get a \u201cfair\u201d send-off. And guess what: they shouldn\u2019t. This world is not fair. NARRATIVEThis is the big one. The story is meant for people who understand the CONTEXT. The story is NOT meant for people who want a hero-based plot. Joel isn\u2019t a hero. Ellie isn\u2019t innocent. People were angry because Joel died the way he did. But they fail to realize that you as the player did the exact same things to others in the first game as they were done to Joel in this one. The idea is that even though Joel was presented as the GOOD GUY to us\\, that doesn\u2019t make him the hero.The story is meant to show the player one thing: perspective. This is why you WATCH Abby kill Joel\\, and THEN play through her flashback. It is meant to challenge you. Apparently\\, we as gamers have not evolved past the \u201cshoot and run\u201d mentality of video games. Apparently\\, few of us can understand Naughty Dog\u2019s vision. If you are thinking about getting this game\\, or if you are unsure of what to think now that you\u2019ve reached the credits\\, look at it this way: there is absolutely nothing that this world owes to you. Do not play this game if all you can fathom in video games is a black and white hero story. This is meant to question your belief\\, it is meant to make you uncomfortable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
