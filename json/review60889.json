It's disappointing that fans of the first game wait years and years to get their favorite character killed in the first hour - i'm assuming eliminating any chance of getting to play him ( beyond riding his horse from point a to point b ). I get that it's shocking but I don't want to just play as Ellie - I also wanted to play as Joel. Add a spoonful of agenda and the story just feels distant from the first. Game is beautiful. Game play is almost exactly the same ( which doesn't bother me far too much - thought there'd be something new ).\u2026 Expand","true":true}
