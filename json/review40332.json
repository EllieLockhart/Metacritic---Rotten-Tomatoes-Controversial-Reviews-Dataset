Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst movies\\, period\\, I have ever seen. Definitely the worst Star Wars movie. I wanted to leave the theater like 5 times\\, which I never\\, ever saw coming. This is basically a Transformers movie with Star Wars characters.\\n\\nPreface: I'm 35 years old and a regular Star Wars fan. So don't paint my review into a \\\"he's a diehard fan and diehard fans hate everything that's not perfect.\\\" That's not me. I have loved what Disney has being doing with the franchise up to this point with the 2 previous movies\\, cartoon series\\, books\\, etc. I really enjoyed The Force Awakens and Rogue One.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, however\\, was absolutely awful. Watching the scene with Leia floating through space was so bad and so unbelievable\\, I actually thought to myself\\, \\\"Wow\\, Star Wars is dead.\\\" The only reason I didn't leave was because I care about the storyline.\\n\\nI can't believe they approved this script and let the director do it like this. I feel they (Disney) just wanted to make it and make it as big as possible---hence my Transformers reference. Snoke's throne room was the epitome and lazy filmmaking to me. Just a single throne\\, a few guards\\, and a completely red background. No imagination. No set design. Nothing.\\n\\nI remember when they first hired JJ Abrams to direct The Force Awakens\\, he said he wanted to make the Star Wars universe feel real again. This movie punches that idea in the face. \\n\\nI'm disappointed like a lot of other people are\\, but I'm also sad. I feel my worst fears about Disney have come true. Honestly\\, this one makes even the prequel trilogy look pretty good in hindsight.","true":true}
