Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put They destroyed the franchise with this movie.They completely changed Luke's Character and turned him into a inmature and inexperienced coward. Turned Leia invincible for no reason. Made Rey more powerful than the hero of the previous trilogy with no training at all. Gave the worst possible exit to one of the most important character of the franchise.  Many questions left unanswered and the ones they did answer they did in the most lamest way possible. I have lost all interest in this franchise. Thank you Disney for approving this garbage. Next instead of paying critics off you should use the money to hire good writers.","true":true}
