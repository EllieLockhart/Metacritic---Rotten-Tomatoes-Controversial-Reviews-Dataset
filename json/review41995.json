Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie looked good that was about it. Half of this movie adds absolutely nothing to the plot except the WORST character in star wars history Rose. There are several awful jokes that are out of place and not funny at all. My favourite character Fin from the force awakens is wasted. They continually show a lack of basic understanding of space and how gravity works. I have much more wrong with this move but cant say much else without spoilers. If it wasn't for a few good performances it would get 1 star.","true":true}
