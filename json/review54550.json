Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a Star Wars fan\\, though perhaps not a die-hard one. I loved Rogue One and while I wasn't the biggest fan of Force Awakens\\, I felt it had real potential\\, so that\\, if followed up well in later films\\, I would come back to it as an amazing set up film for the trilogy. Sadly Last Jedi was thoroughly disappointing\\, frustrating and upsetting. \\n\\nPositives: \\n-The film looks wonderful\\, beautiful settings and fascinating character and creature designs. \\n-The acting was pretty darn good from all of the main cast\\n-The new characters themselves have a lot of potential to be fun and interesting\\, the story just lets them down.\\n\\nNegatives: \\n-The character assassination of Luke and Leia (and Han in Force Awakens).   \\n-Multiple plot holes within the story line and inconsistencies within the Star Wars universe. \\n-Some rather misplaced comedy that is more in keeping with a Marvel superhero film\\, think zingy one liners rather than comedy that arises naturally between characters. \\n-All the villains show themselves to be weak\\, which makes it hard to take them seriously.\\n-The film is heavy handed in delivering \\\"moral lessons\\\" it's really patronising. \\n-Poe and Rey in particular are a bit too \\\"Mary Sue\\\" in their abilities and neither suffer personal consequences.  \\n\\nIf you don't think of the film as a Star Wars film\\, but instead as a filler episode of a sci-fi TV series it's actually quite enjoyable to watch\\, if a bit stupid. I wish JJ and Johnson hadn't felt that in order to make people care about their new characters and story\\, they had to tear down the legacy of the old characters. The audience see Luke\\, Leia and Han suffer and grow throughout the original trilogy and eventually succeed in defeating the Empire. Then the new films basically retcon the growth these characters went through in their character arcs and resets the galaxy in order to keep the \\\"Rebels vs Empire\\\" set up without making it very believable. Why should I care what these new characters do\\, if the new series might just retcon it all?","true":true}
