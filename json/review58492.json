Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An adventure that has holes\\, but on the whole will leave you feeling excited and satisfied. *Spoilers upcoming* What Johnson does with this film is good. It\u2019s not great\\, it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s good. The issues i have with this movie come from the reality that he\u2019s trying to develop too many characters. The storyline with Rose and Finn wasn\u2019t just boring\\, it was unnecessary and a direct product of\\, \u201cwell they need to do something\u201d. The two characters meaningless journey made me realize early on that this movie was going to feel its length because of that plot thread. After reflecting on this movie some more it became even more apparent how much these movies need to be about jedis and Jedi battles. If this movie focused solely on Mark\\, Adam and Daisy for 2.5 hours\\, I\u2019d probably give it 4.5. They didn\u2019t just carry this movie\\, they provided some of the most thrilling and joyous moments I\u2019ve seen in film recently. The next big issue i had with the film is the forced humor. I completely understand why it\u2019s in there (Appeal to kids\/broaden product to include some jokes) but it didn\u2019t need to be. Jokes are fine but not really when the stakes are this high\\, and hundreds of people are dying every 30 minutes it seems. Maybe that\u2019s my own personal preference sneaking in\\, but i think this movie would have benefited from a more serious approach. Not necessarily needing to be dark\\, but take the magnitude of the dilemma seriously\\, and the audience will as well. So those are my negatives. My positives: everything with Mark\\, Adam\\, and Daisy. Incredible character development and tension. The story direction looks great leading into the finale. Overall\\, if you love action adventure and Star Wars in general\\, see this movie\\, you\u2019ll like it","true":true}
