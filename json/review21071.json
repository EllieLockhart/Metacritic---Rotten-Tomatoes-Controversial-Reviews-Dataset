Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was severely disappointed. Why can't they break away from the original movies? The movie starts out with the rebels fleeing their base (Hoth anyone?)\\, the empire chases the rebels (just as Han Solo was chased in the asteroid field)\\, Rey is on a far-off planet being trained by a Jedi but decides to leave early to confront the villian (Dagobah system) and then after the confrontation\\, is asked to join Kylo Ren to rule the empire (Sky city). There are just too many repeats\\, and don't get me started on the Finn arch or the stupid humor throughout. What the heck was that all about? Seemed all over the place. Yes\\, critics will call this a success due to the number of people who saw it. I wish I could take back my money to show how disappointed I am with the film. I expected so much more and yet it fell flat on its face.","true":true}
