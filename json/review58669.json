Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I just finished the game. While I thought the frost one was one of the best game ever made. I been playing video games more than 40 years and I have played many sequels. I seen ups and downs over the years\\, saying that\\, I have never looked forward to a game more than this game\\, I put up with all of the delays\\, I bought the special edition and eagerly waited to play\\, I have spent over 25 hours over the last 5 days playing it. I have never been so disappointed. The first half of the game was really great\\, but when I was forced to play as Abby\\, I felt sick to my stomach. If I would have know I was going to be forced to play a character that I hated\\, I would not have bought the game day one\\, would have waited until the price dropped. The only enjoyment I got was finding repeatedly why to kill her\\, my favorite was\\, having her jump of the skyscraper bridge. I hate her so much and to play it just to finish the game is so wrong. I am not even going back to play it again to get the platinum trophy. So if love the first one\\, just wait the the greatest hits version come out. Btw I am not a bot. Just someone giving my honest review.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
