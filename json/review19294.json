Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not Star Wars. That's for sure. It is something new. Yeah\\, all of the characters are the same\\, but it goes in its own direction and in someways can even be described as a \\\"critique\\\" of Star Wars itself.  Rian Johnson had an impossible task on his hands; to give people what they want\\, but to be different.  Like so much flack Star Wars 7 got for rehashing old themes\\, this Star Wars sets them up as sort of a critique of our dependence and yet our repulsion to being fed the same things over and over again. \\\"Let it die\\\" is the credo of this movie.  I thought it was brilliant for what it was.  It did what it needed to do. Rian Johnson was set up with an impossible task and he did something creative and artistic. He gave the people something new.  And that's what this is.","true":true}
