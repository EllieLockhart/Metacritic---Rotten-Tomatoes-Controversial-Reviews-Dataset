Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really sad that it has come to this.  This is another action movie.  That's all.  Finn takes up far too much screen time just to highlight how pointless he is.  BB8 can drive ATSTs.  Yeah.  And save the animals\\, that's important too.  Save the animals everyone.  Don't worry about your extremely important mission.  Just save the animals and it's \\\"worth it.\\\". I really hated most of this movie.   Insert some more tension breakers why don't you?  Would it kill you to have us care about what's happening on screen?","true":true}
