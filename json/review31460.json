Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some points in no particular order:\\n\\n- Story arc is two slow ships chasing each other slowly \\n\\n- Finn finally stops running from FO and goes to kill self...NO\\n\\n- The majestic ending of TFA...obliterated \\n\\n- editing so Fisher sacrificed herself destroying snokes ship and Dern becomes big good....NO\\n\\n- Those frog nurses on Luke's planet DAFUQ \\n\\n- Luke milking a cow and staring at Rey while drinking jizz \\n\\n- The dog riding casino scene worse than pod racing \\n\\n- Snoke gone cos erm\\, dunno \\n\\n- Rey Ren team up was fucking ACE. But their alliance lasted about 16 seconds (bottled her turning)\\n\\n- Luke haircut was just so fucking distracting \\n\\n- Rey actress can't really act and it's not helped her character is fucking perfect at absolutely everything\\n\\n- There is no big bad\\, no old guard\\, no rebels\\, nothing left for Episode 9.\\n\\nI'm all for change etc and taking story risk. But fuck me\\, fuck me it's Fucking garbage\\, absolute garbage. Plot holes up the ying yang. The humour was so poor and felt like GoTG. Jesus fucking Christmas I hate it.\\n\\nTIME WILL BE BRUTAL ON THE LAST JEDI.","true":true}
