Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson decided to subvert expectations across the board...  which can sometimes be neat...  but when it's this heavy handed\\,  it makes it hard to take any if the dramatic parts seriously.\\n\\nAlso hard to look past ideologically driven cast and plot choices. I hate to even mention it\\, but it's really distracting.  \\n\\nToo long..  tone and pacing issues...  great visuals","true":true}
