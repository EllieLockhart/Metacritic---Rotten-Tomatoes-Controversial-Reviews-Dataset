Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes\\, was a fun movie but the ending ruined it for me. After additional thought\\, I've decided on reducing the stars. This movie was complete crap\\, worse than phantom menace. ","true":true}
