Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies ever. This film has everything that a Star Wars film should have\\, action scenes\\, lightsaber battles\\, awesome characters and an interesting story. In my opinion only Star Wars fans will love it and understand it. If you are not a big fan you will not get the movie and because of that finding it boring. I think this movie is better than The Force Awakens and the prequels.","true":true}
