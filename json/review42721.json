Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great as a lifelong Star Wars fan.  I have no idea why anyone else would feel so vitriolic about this movie.  It was hopeful and beautiful\\, the change of pace was a breath of fresh air after \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" (which I also loved) where it seemed like the old formula was just being recycled.  It just goes to show you can't please everyone\\, but this was my favorite Star Wars movie by far.","true":true}
