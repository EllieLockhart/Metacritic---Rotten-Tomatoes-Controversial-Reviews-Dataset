Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dreadful film. \\n\\nIt's not about being a purist Star Wars fan from the 1970s.  This was a dreadful script\\, disjointed film and it trashed the characters and foundation  of the original films.\\n\\nLeia surviving in space then floating like Mary Poppins back to the ship?.  \\n\\nAs someone has already said \\\"now we know why Mark Hamill hated the script so much\\\".\\n\\n I'm taking the original 3 films and Rogue One and going home.\\n\\nRIP Star Wars.","true":true}
