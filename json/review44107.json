Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was a visually stunning film with extremely flawed plot points and awful character usage. The twists in it were put in for the sake of proving the audience wrong about their theories and speculations. Luke\\, Leia and Ackbar's characters were thrown completely out the window\\, while the new characters seemed shallow and unrelatable. Political statements stood in the way of good storytelling\\, and so many interesting ideas were wasted. Though the high points were really high\\, the low points were even lower. Even the amazing visual effects and CGI were not able to redeem this movie for me.","true":true}
