Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie is easily the worst of all Star Wars movies for so many reasons.\\n\\nIt makes the Prequels look good...how did Star Wars get to this point.
