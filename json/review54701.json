Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked The Force Awakens; saw it 5 or 6 times in theaters. I also really enjoy the salvageable moments in the prequels\\, though they were universally panned... Obviously\\, the original trilogy is a national treasure...\\n\\nI have a problem with this movie. A story arc that was set in motion in 1977 and faithfully carried out over parts of the next three decades has veered wildly off-course here\\, in my opinion.\\n\\nMy bachelors degree is in narrative theory\\, and I know that if you look at Star Wars the story - not always the execution\\, but the overall story - it's quintessential. That\\, more than anything is why everyone loved it. To be honest\\, the originals were mostly bad movies\\, too. But we loved them for the quintessence of the heroes journey\\, and how George Lucas wrote us a living mythology. That's what stories are\\, they're mythologies that orient us within society. Movies are how we now get those myths that our psyches grab hold of.\\n\\nEvery movie in the main trilogies of Star Wars\\, from episodes 1 to 7\\, is consistent with that arc - the heroes journey. It's old as time. Listen\\, I love playing with expectations\\, and breaking the rules. Modern drama is so alive and vivid and it challenges us\\, and that's why I wanted to be a writer. But that's not what anybody loved Star Wars for. We loved it for the way that it resonates with us fundamentally; with the way human beings experienced myth in a classical sense for thousands of years and even today.\\n\\nThis movie not only departs frenetically from that in so many ways\\, but in my opinion\\, executes what it attempts to do more poorly than any other Star Wars film. I'm obviously not a fan at all of the writing\\, or the Transformers-esque\\, in-your-face derring do\\, which doesn't attempt to advance the plot\\, and which dominates screentime that could be used for\\, oh\\, I don't know - the metamorphosis of your established characters and why they do any of the things they do\\, and why we should care... \\n\\n*sigh*\\n\\nFor every time someone wants to talk about how this was the best Star Wars ever there is someone like me who is choking on their own vomit trying to understand how and... HOW... (Seriously\\, how?) that was either a good movie\\, or a good Star Wars movie\\, and what could possibly happen in episode 8 that could save the ending of a tale 40 years in the making from an irreverent and inane ending.","true":true}
