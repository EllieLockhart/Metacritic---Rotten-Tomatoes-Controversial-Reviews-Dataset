Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie\\, convenient storylines\\, dull cartoonish characters\\, idiotic plot twists. Did not feel like a starters movie. The opening scene with was stupid humor that distracted from the story. They make Finn look like an idiot walking around in his water suite.. These points happen within the first five minutes of the movie. I could go on. I so glade I waited to watch this on Red Box.","true":true}
