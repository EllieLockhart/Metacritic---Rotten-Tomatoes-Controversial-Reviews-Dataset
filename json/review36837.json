Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie throws the history of the series in the trash. Doesn't bother with character development\\, while pushing an agenda. If you question any of this\\, the heads of the studio will actually name-call and attack your character. I pretty much hate this movie and what Disney has allowed it to become.","true":true}
