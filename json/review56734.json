{"101487":176815,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie itself has a lot of promise\\, delivering the type of high-octane\\, immersive content which fans wanted to see. The glaring issue\\, however\\, is that the \\\"twists\\\" which everyone's been feverishly whispering about fall flat as anything you could imagine. I enjoyed elements of The Last Jedi\\, truly\\, but the narrative style clearly indicates the current status of Disney's Star Wars trilogy: shock value. Everything is done to get the audience to go \\\"Whaaaaat?! That's crazy!\\\" And that's it. There's no lasting impact. The movie disappeared from my thoughts basically once I left the theatre. It doesn't mean it's a bad movie\\, per se\\, but it is a vapid movie attempting to distance the franchise from anything offensive so Disney can market it. It comes down to\\, \\\"which characters make good toys?\\\" Or \\\"which characters can become icons for the new generation?\\\" The latter I have no problem with\\, but the former makes me feel take advantage of as a viewer. If you are reading this\\, and you like movies as an audio-visual experience without much meaning or risk: buy The Last Jedi merchandise. Frankly\\, Disney would prefer that you buy their toys & games in addition to their movies\\, so if you buy the movie you should be a good to Disney and just keep buying\\, buying\\, buying. If you're reading this & you enjoy watching movies for their substance\\, original techniques of filming\\, and\/or believable drama\\, I recommend avoiding paying any amount of money for The Last Jedi. Even if Mark Hamill brings another incredible (if... off-putting) portrayal of Luke Skywalker to the big screen\\, this movie betrays his talent. Support his voice acting career; his VO roles number in the hundreds at this point. Again\\, TLJ is a good \\\"experience\\\" to see in IMAX or something\\, like Suckerpunch (2011) was\\, but don't be disappointed in the storytelling or world building. You already paid for it. Disney doesn't care if you enjoy it.","true":true}
