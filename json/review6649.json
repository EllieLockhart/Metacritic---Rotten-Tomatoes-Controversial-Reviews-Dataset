Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the crazed psychofans that think this movie \\\"betrayed the legacy\\\" of Star Wars. Well written\\, well acted and well directed. It's a strong middle act that sets up endless possibilities for the conclusion of this trilogy.","true":true}
