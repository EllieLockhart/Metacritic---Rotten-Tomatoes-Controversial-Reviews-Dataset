Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED this movie. It had so many twists and turns and was not like most of the other movies. It was dark\\, funny\\, and at some parts emotional. It made you think that anyone can be special and the everyone has something special to give. Don't let the the negative comments why you away from this movie it was amazing. Also\\, some of these fans are forgetting that the prequels exist and those are not the best movies so they need to lay off just because they were upset about how something happened in the movie and it was not what they wanted.","true":true}
