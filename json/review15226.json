Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie but if I was going to say something about it that i didnt care for was some of the comedy and placement. I feel like if they did a rogue one style on this movie it would be an A+ . good twists and amazing fight scenes. lets see what happens on episode 9","true":true}
