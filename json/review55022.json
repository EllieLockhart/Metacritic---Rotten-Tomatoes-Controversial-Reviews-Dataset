Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why a movie reviewer would love this movie. It is 2 and  a half hours of surprises. The biggest criticism for force awakens was that it didn't surprise enough\\, or that it was too similar to the original Star Wars. Well I feel like the producers responded by saying: \\\"Hey! Let's make this as surprising as possible!!!\\\". They then must have promptly hired a committee of people to come up with every expectation that people had for this movie and find ways to turn those all on there heads. I guarantee that if you (being someone interested in this movie\\, I can assume you have questions and expectations about it) asked me 5 questions related to what you expect to happen in this movie\\, I would give you 5 answers that would surprise\\, if not baffle you! Now\\, if this was any other movie\\, that would be a phenomenal quality\\, this is obviously why critics adore this one. But the truth is\\, this is star wars not some random new movie\\, I as a consumer don't really want to be surprised. I wanted my wishes to be fulfilled\\, I wanted my heroes to shine\\, and my villains to lose\\, because these characters aren't just characters they are practically family members that I grew up with\\, and just like all my family I want them to predictably succeed not surprise me. This isn't to say that this wasn't a good movie\\, it just wasn't what I wanted in a star wars movie. The lesson here is that there is no perfect movie. The Force Awakens was widely loved\\, but folks found complaints (as they always do). By trying to fix the complaints\\, the final product made regular people less happy. The solution? Just make movies\\, don't listen to critics or people\\, don't try to fix a good thing\\, just make the movie the director and writer want\\, and let the risk play out.","true":true}
