{"101487":130739,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not hate the Last Jedi as much as most people do\\, But it is still kind of crappy. It is better than Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones for sure\\, But it ruins so many beloved characters. They demolished Luke and the new characters and Snoke is so under used.","true":true}
