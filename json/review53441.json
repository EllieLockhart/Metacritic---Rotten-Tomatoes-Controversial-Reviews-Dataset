Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissapointing and exhausting - cutting away bad\\, cringeworthy and simply stupid puns (are we calling the genre Space-Comedy yet?)\\, special effects and the (unsuccessful) try to copy all those tiny and much loved details of the previous trilogies you are left with an overcomplicated story that takes a lot of time to tell but doesn't actually tell that much.\\nIt's clearly visible that it was intended to copy and combine many if not all legendary moments and side characters of earlier episodes (confrontation between Luke and the Imperator\/Darth Vader\\, battle of Hoth\\, Pod Racers\\, Ewoks\\, appearance of a wise Yoda) and create a movie full of \\\"I am your father\\\"-like plot twists\\, but the exact opposite was accomplished and watching Jar Jar Binks giving a 2-hour motivational speech to his fellow Gungans could not have been more boring.\\nNot often has it happened to me\\, that I was actually happy to have finished a movie with only the hope for a better next episode keeping me inside the theater.","true":true}
