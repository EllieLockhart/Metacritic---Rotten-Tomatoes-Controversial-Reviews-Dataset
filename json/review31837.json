Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Specticale only - the plot falls apart under any attention. Worst of all Disney throws away an entire franchise and thumbs it's nose at decades of established history\\, universe building\\, characters\\, and plot. Even as a casual fan\\, this was actually abysmal. ","true":true}
