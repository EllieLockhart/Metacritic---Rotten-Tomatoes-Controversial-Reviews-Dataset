Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A movie with tons of set-up and misdirection which ultimately leaves you empty. A poor story overall and decisions which will leave star wars fans fuming.\\n\\n+ Throne room scene - One of the best in the whole SAGA\\n+ Holden Hyperspace scene self sacrifice.\\n+ Some great jokes and nods to previous canon.\\n+ Rey and Kylo's interactions via force.\\n+ Seeing Yoda again\\n+ Caretakers\\n\\n- Whole Kanto Bite sequence.\\n- Space Leia\\n- Killing off snoke too soon and in that way.\\n- Too much misdirection pretending to kill off other characters (Finn\\, Rose\\, Leia)\\n- Phasma ruined again (shes the baddest ass in the galaxy - read the novel).\\n- Luke giving him up to the force.\\n- So much misplaced humor (Put a shirt on\\,  holding for hux)\\n- General Holden subplot. Why keep the plan a secret?\\n- The whole thing about ships running out of fuel.\\n- Maz cameo\\n- DJ being underused.\\n- BB8 being a convenient plot device over and over. BB8-ex machina\\n- No knights of Ren.\\n- Why did Maz have Luke's Lightsaber?\\n- Rey's parents being nobodys and Snoke having no backstory.\\n\\nDisney need to rethink. Wonder how Lucas feels.","true":true}
