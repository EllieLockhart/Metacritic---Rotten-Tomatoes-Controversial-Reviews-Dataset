Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know it's bad when Mark-fricking-Hamill himself hates the film or at least the way Luke is presented in this film\\, as for the rest of this film... I am short for words and not in a good way\\, I can't believe I am saying this but I wish JJ Abrams directed and wrote this one as well. At least then we would have gotten a film with a cohesive story which picked up on the story threads left in TFA instead of unnecessarily killing of the film's potential and reviving pointless characters only to do the same thing all over again. I can't wait for Episode IX the same way that I couldn't wait for Episode III since once again finally - it's time for the saga to end.","true":true}
