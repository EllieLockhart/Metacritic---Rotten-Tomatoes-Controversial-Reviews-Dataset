Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed by this film the first time I watched it. I couldn't even watch it a second time further than the uninspiring intro bomber run. Such a waste\\, all those setups and questions that the first film threw at us\\, what happened?","true":true}
