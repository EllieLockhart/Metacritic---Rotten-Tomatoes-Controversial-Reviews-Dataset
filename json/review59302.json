We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a different kind of game\\, its been over 3 months since I've finished it and i still can't stop thinking about it. The presentation in this game is perfect\\, it is one of the best looking games out there \\, the characters look so realistic\\, the animators and voice actors bring every character to life.

YouThis game is a different kind of game\\, its been over 3 months since I've finished it and i still can't stop thinking about it. The presentation in this game is perfect\\, it is one of the best looking games out there \\, the characters look so realistic\\, the animators and voice actors bring every character to life. The gameplay is so brutal\\, it is a major improvement from the last game. You have alot of new weapons\\, alot of new takedowns as aswell. The AI in this game is really smart and unpredictable\\, you can tackle an encounter the same way twice\\, but it'll end up differently because the AI does something different the second time. The stealth in this game is done perfectly\\, and the soundtrack makes everything more intense and gets you more engaged. The NPCs in this game scream in pain when you kill them and call out the names of their fallen teammates when they're killed. This made every NPC feel alive and more real to the player. The game takes so many bold twists\\, alot of the events are very unexpected and surprising. This game literally put me in a war with my own emotions. People who say the story is about \\\"revenge is bad\\\" are reducing the plot to its absolute surface\\, there's so much more to it. This is easily one of the best story driven games of all time\\, probably the best sequel i could've asked for. The game isnt perfect\\, it has some flaws\\, but theyre all easily outweighed by everything else. There were moments while i was playing this game where i literally forgot these are fictional characters\\, living in a fictional world\\, thats how engaging and interesting it is. Playing this game is an experience I'll never forget\\, Naughty Dog has once again made an excellent and unforgettable game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
