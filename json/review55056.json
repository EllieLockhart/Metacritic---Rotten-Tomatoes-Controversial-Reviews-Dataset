Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never left a review before. I've never really felt compelled to do so\\, until now. I'll start this by saying I'm a huge star wars fan. I love The Force Awaken\\, I even loved the prequels. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a poorly written story. I don't believe its the story most fans wanted to see. Its a poorly executed attempt to mimic the events in empire strike back in a different order. The movie could have been thirty minutes shorter. I would have loved a long movie had it actually had interesting plot lines and answered the questions fans were interested in. I can't comment much more as it would just reveal spoilers and I don't want to do that necessarily to those\\nwho have not seen it yet. The things I can say are the Whole Finn Rose thing was a waste of time and unnecessary. I didn't like the way Luke Skywalker was portrayed in any of it. Especially the part about how Ben Solo became Kylo Ren. Speaking of which where are the knights of Ren?  I don't think this was the story fans wanted to see. There were also problems with the plot and the flow of the movie. In one point of the movie Rey is in one place and then later on in  another. I turned to my friend and said did I miss something how did she get there? My friend didn't know either... Did we miss something? I doubt it... I also didn't care for what felt like forced humor at times. \\n\\n I'm hoping Disney is rethinking allowing Rian Johnson direct the next Star Wars Saga. Can JJ fix this? JJ are you listening? There was so much potential here. The highs for me were of course the CGI\\, it was stunning. The musical score was awesome as usual. there were parts in the movie that did hit my \\nemotions but when the movie was over it just came up short for me.","true":true}
