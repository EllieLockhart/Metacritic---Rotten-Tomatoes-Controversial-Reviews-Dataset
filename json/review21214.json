Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the movie last night and I cannot say that I like it that much. I think it is the weakest Star Wars movie to date. 98% critics rating from critics ? Wow. I absolutely disagree with this rating. There is nothing in the movie that justify such high score. The story is weak with parts borrowed from Empire Strikes Back \\, some characters performance is ... weird. I enjoyed rogue one much \\, much more. Star Wars gets worse and worse with each new installment.","true":true}
