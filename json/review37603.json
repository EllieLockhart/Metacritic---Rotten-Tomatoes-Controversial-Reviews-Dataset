Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is nothing special about this movie. Disney paid the critics for good ratings on this movie. I normally side with the critics rating over the user ratings\\, but the user ratings of 51% are correct. The movie wasn't that bad but is wasn't good. You can put this movie at the 2nd worst Star Wars Movie\\, only 2nd to the Star Wars Holiday Special. This movie is 2017 remake of thw Star Wars Holiday Special. \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26","true":true}
