Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, confused\\, angering\\, unfaithful to characters and a story we have been watching since the 70s. Tore up something great when there was no need to. Ruined any possibility of the new trilogy being good\\, can JJ save this in EP 9? I'm not sure\\, so much damage was done","true":true}
