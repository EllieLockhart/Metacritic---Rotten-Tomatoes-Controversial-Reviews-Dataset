Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi breaks continuity and open up more plot holes to the franchise... The movie felt like a waste of time. Pacing was bad\\, there was no payoffs to the setups in The Force Awaken.\\nHypothetically\\, the movies would make more sense if we cut the last 5 minutes of The Force Awaken\\, and attach it to the last 15 minutes of The Last Jedi..","true":true}
