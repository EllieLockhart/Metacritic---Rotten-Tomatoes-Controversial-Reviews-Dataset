Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Man I had to create an account just to confirm\\, yes I played the game\\, took my time until later on the game when I just wanted it to end\\, I just couldn't bear anymore the game trying to push on me to like Abby\\, I mean you just can't after the brutal way she kills Joel\\, maybe if you were introduced to her first I could care about her\\, but not like this\\, the game constantly forces the hand (Ellie killing dogs\\, Abby pets them\\, fking arms like Conan\\, playing as Abby against Ellie is notouriously difficult just so you despise her) even the final fight they completely change the appearance of Abby\\, yea you say she hasn't eated and couldn't get her roids but even then the game tricks you with another braided hair NPC that looks like her\\, this isn't the same person that killed Joel it diminishes your anger\\, the flashbacks are amazing and thats because it's the story we wanted to see\\, heck you can even make an entire game based on new characters and thats fine but the way they presented the new characters and intertwined both stories is so wrong I just wanted it to end\\, I genuinely wanted to stop playing several times\\, and I came here to say so\\, I did play the game\\, but this is just like GoT ending.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
