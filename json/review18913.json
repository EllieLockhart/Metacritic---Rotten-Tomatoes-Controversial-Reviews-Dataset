Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a Star Wars movie where the bad guys didn't get treated like a joke. The first order showed competence and the harebrained plans of the rebels failed. That in and of itself made this one of the Star Wars movies in the saga.","true":true}
