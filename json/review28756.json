Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite a dull experience - too many characters basically doing nothing. Perhaps it would have been better to stop after the first six films - the first three was a great story\\, in the next three it was interesting to know the past of the characters\\, but so far two of the final three films seems mostly like history repeating itself with better graphics - quite a shame when considering the importance of this old series of films.","true":true}
