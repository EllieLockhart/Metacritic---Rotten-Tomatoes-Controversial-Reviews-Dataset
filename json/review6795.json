Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t seem to understand why so many people are hating on this film. It was absolutely great\\, while it had a sub-plot that seemed unnecessary\\, it still is a great film. This movie departs from the formula of most other Star Wars films and delivers a great story.
