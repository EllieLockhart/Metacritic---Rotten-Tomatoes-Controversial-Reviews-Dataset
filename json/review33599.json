Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible in every way. From Mary Poppins in space to the death of a Sith Lord which we know nothing about. We have a crap plot that seemed scattered and convenient. Rose was a complete waste of a character. No attachment to characters\\, especially the relationship between Luke and Kylo. We needed some more back story to understand the gravity of that scene. They went overkill with the Porgs and Finn besting Phasma meant nothing since we know nothing about Phasma.","true":true}
