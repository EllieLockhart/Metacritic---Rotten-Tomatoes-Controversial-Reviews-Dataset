Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"honestly I can't believe I am writing this. I rarely have bad things to say about movies. holy fucking shit... How star wars the last jedi got positive reviews is beyond me. I can't believe I'm saying this but it rather watch garbage water evaporate in a dumpster than to see that movie again. The only reason I might watch it again is to make sure I didn't hallucinate how much of an expensive turd it is. NOT ONE LIGHT SABRE CLASHED WITH ANOTHER LIGHT SABRE THE ENTIRE MOVIE. With snoke\\, rey\\, Kylo\\, and like all confronting each other and all that happens is whinning and confusion mixed with some more bitching. And princess organa gets sucks out in space and then all of a sudden after which is pure death she floats back to the ship like a god damn video game. I rather watch a 2 hour video of Anakin in revenge of the sith complaining about his dreams to jar jar binks continuous on loop with gang nam style playing in the background while I myself get my toe nails ripped off.","true":true}
