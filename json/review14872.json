Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand where all the hate and backlash is coming from for this movie. I was really happy with how it turned out! There were a few scenes that I could've done without (the Canto Bight storyline wasn't my thing) but overall\\, I think Rian Johnson has created a visually stunning film\\, and added more depth to the new characters we were introduced to in The Force Awakens.","true":true}
