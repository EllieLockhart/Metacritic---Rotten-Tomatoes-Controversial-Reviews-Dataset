Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The reason why i have given this game such a low score is due to the false advertising at the teasing of this game where they blatantly used Joel in their trailers making the whole last of us community believe that he would join Ellie's journey but they instead swap these cinematics with Jesse\\, which is just a another way they destroyed their own reputation. Additionally\\, the only critic that give the best response with constructive criticism is IGN Japan\\, the gameplay of this game is fantastic but the story is the heart and soul of the game and that's completely destroyed by politics which the last game did not blatantly push in your face. i can see why Naughty dog lost a large amount of its employees one of my speculations is probably because the writer and director Neil Druckmann can not take any constructive criticism  but would rather call you a bigot or would just rather just take all the positive reviews. The game purposely wants to do a parallel between Ellie and Abby but it just does not sick together its just too forced and ruins the flow of the story. Finally\\, Abby kills Joel even though he saves her life without hesitation but when i comes to Lev and Yara they save her life but hesitate at the start but she spares them and helps them at the end\\, even though they have probably killed countless numbers of the WLF and her friends this is a plot hole which makes no sense at all. It would probably be better if they just left the last of us franchise alone instead of destroying it with every political statement.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
