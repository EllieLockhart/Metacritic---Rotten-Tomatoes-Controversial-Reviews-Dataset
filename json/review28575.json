Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the most mature and well thought out Star Wars ever. Rian Johnson has given Star Wars the shot in the arm it needs. Much deeper than you'd expect with a great deal of character development and so much nuance. Those that think it has plot holes or makes no sense should give it another try\\, much of the criticism I've seen suggests people missed a lot of things or didn't catch some of the more subtle points being made.","true":true}
