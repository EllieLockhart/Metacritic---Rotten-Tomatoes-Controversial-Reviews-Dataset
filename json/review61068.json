This is hands down one of the the most beautiful games on PS4\\, right up there with Horizon Zero Dawn. The world feels natural\\, like nature is reclaiming the world in a slightly comforting way\\, and if it wasn't for all the murdering and zombies\\, It's a world I would love to be in myself.\r\rAnd that is about the only good I can say about this game. The story. Good lord the story. I read the spoilers before I played it\\, so I knew what was going to happen\\, and that didn't bother me too much.. but the game itself is actually WORSE than the spoilers let me to believe. I want this to be a spoiler free review so I won't go into detail\\, but \\\"that\\\" scene happens much earlier than I thought\\, the plot seems stupid so far\\, and the characters aren't acting even remotely like they did in TLoU1\\, it's like they're not even the same people.\r\rI'm just sorry\\, I knew this game was gonna be bad\\, I bought it anyway to give it a try.. I'm returning it tomorrow for a refund.. Another god-tier IP ruined by identity politics.\r\rI'm only giving it a 3 because goddamn is it pretty\\, and the combat isn't horrible.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
