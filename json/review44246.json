Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took the family to see the new Star Wars movie\\, big fans of the original trilogy\\, collected figures growing up\\, play the games\\, read the books (still do)\\, however came out of the movie disappointed. Not very entertaining due to dumb jokes\\, long drawn out scenes and poor script. My kids didn't even like it nor want anything to do with this movie. They should have used the EU and the numerous books available at least as a reference. Not looking forward to the next one but we will see I suppose.","true":true}
