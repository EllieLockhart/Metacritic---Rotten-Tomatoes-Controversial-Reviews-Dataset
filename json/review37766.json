Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were 3 storylines of the movie. The Rey\\, Luke and Kylo Ren storyline i liked. The Poe and Holdo and the Finn and Rose storylines are really bad.","true":true}
