Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Director Rian Johnson's approach to Star Wars is unconventional\\, yet is right.  I haven't clapped and cheered so loudly in a theater since The Force Awakens. Johnson gives us the Star Wars we love\\, while also including fresh elements never seen before in the franchise. Truly a Star Wars for a new generation. Fans with specific expectations might not like The Last Jedi\\, because Johnson's narrative is so unexcepting.","true":true}
