Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too much queso for my liking. Still overall satisfied with the final product. Just not what I had hoped it could have been. I viewed and defended the safeness of the plot in Episode 7: The Force Awakens as character setup up for a fast moving Episode 8 The Last Jedi and a darker Kylo Ren. While it was fresh had had some amazing scenes with the island and how the balance of the force works I was still left wanting more.","true":true}
