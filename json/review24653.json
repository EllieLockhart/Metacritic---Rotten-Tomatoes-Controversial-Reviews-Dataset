Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was a mess. I did not like The force Awakens and this movie just adds more to my hate of the new movies. The last Jedi seemed like it was trying to be a comedy instead of a Star Wars movie. An the total disrespect to Luke to make him seem so weak that he would kill his own apprentice is crazy. The questions I had from TFA did not get answered at all in this movie. An I was left confused and upset. Serious Star War fans that love the lore will leave the movie theaters disappointed.","true":true}
