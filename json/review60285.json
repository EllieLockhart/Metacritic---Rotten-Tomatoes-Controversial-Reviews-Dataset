The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I find it interesting that most people who scored the game 0\/10 pretty much had nothing to say except for that they hate women with muscles\\, that Ellie happens to like another woman\\, or that there is no character development at all. Makes me wonder if they actually played the game from start to finish or if they just jumped up on the hate train. Here is my take as a person who absolutely loved the first game and have been waiting patiently for the second part. And boy do they start with a kick to your gut. I read that the story is a lot darker than the last one\\, and it sure is.People talk about character development as if it's supposed to go from one extreme to the other\\, but only from bad to good\\, from immature to experienced\\, from follower to leader. And for parts of TLOU2\\, that is true. Abby\\, first introduced as the person we're supposed to hate\\, who killed Joel\\, goes from a cold\\, rational\\, revenge seeking woman to some who starts to emphasize with people who are supposed to be her enemies. Her story with Lev is one of my favourite parts\\, and really shows how she went from killing enemy kids to doing everything she can to protect 2 strangers.Ellie on the other hand goes from having it all\\, friends\\, a \\\"father\\\"\\, a safe home and even a blossoming relationship to slowly descending into the madness of revenge\\, willing to give up her happiness and future in the pursuit of what she perceives as salvation. Whether people like it or not\\, that too is character development. In a way\\, they switched places over the course of the story. Did my alignment change as well? I can't say. All I can say though is that the last fight **** broke my heart\\, in the best way possible that a game could achieve. What else is there to say? I loved the story\\, the fighting is awesome (same concepts as the last one but adding in the option to play zombies and enemies against each other is amazing\\, the music really manages to capture the feel and the graphics\\, well\\, it's Naught Dog. Was I annoyed at the fact that I suddenly had to play as my enemy after the first act? Sure. But that didn't deter me from finishing the game\\, and I sure am glad I didn't.Overall I can say that this game tugged my heartstrings just like the first one did\\, and it greatly saddens me that people can't get over their own bigotry and enjoy the game for what it is. But if you're gonna be upset at women with big muscles\\, sure\\, skip this one. But if you do decide to play it\\, I promise it will be worth it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
