Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In looking at the landscape of all the Star Wars movies\\, I would have to place this among the top three. As I described to some people\\, it has a very Empire-esque feel to it. I'm not going to concern myself with the other negative audience reviews. People have different likes and interests. I will say 1\/2 star rating is utterly ridiculous. The action and effects alone warrant at minimum two stars. I saw the first Star Wars movie when it was first released at the age of 11. I have seen every theatrical release since. I throughly enjoyed this movie and for a couple of hours to feel the wonder of an 11 year old once again. I encourage everyone who likes this series to see this movie.","true":true}
