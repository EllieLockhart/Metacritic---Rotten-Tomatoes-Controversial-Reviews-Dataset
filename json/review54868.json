Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a good movie. Just a bad Star Wars. \\nAll the charm from the 7 previous movies is lost and the flick os soaked in these pre-produced forgettable vibe. Character's personalities get rewritten without proper justification and the big moments\\, of which there are many\\, feel flat and souless. It feels like a good Marvel movie wherein the story is prominsingly structured and the pacing is lighting fast but none of the emotional\\, mythological\\, epic\\, introspective\\, frontier-based struggles that are at the core of the Star Wars identity and experience are present.","true":true}
