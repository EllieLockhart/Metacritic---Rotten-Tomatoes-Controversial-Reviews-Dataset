After watching many critical reviews and over 130+ worth of gameplay I am confident to say this game deserves a solid 9. Many point out plot holes in the game that could justifly be proven wrong. Many would say Joel death was all for nothing and Ellie gain nothing... but I disagree. Ellie towards the end regain humanity by saving Abby and peace within herself by having closure with Joel. I love that. Only criticism I have of the game is the love triangle Naughty Dawg tried to push with both characters (Abby and Ellie). Besides that I truly did enjoy this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
