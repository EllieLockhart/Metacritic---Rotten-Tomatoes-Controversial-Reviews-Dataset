Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Now I don't dislike this movie whatsoever it is still a nice exciting adventure to see the rebels fighting against the first order\\, but It left me with a bunch of unanswered questions and wasn't really put together right but if your a fan I recommend you seeing it.","true":true}
