Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely disappointed by that movie. Probablythe worst Star Wars ever. I never sat in the theatre thinking 'Man I should probably just go home' - at least not until I watched Star Wars VIII. The plot can be explained in five minutes -v literally - and there is no or only very little connection to the overall Star Wars canon. For people who are not interested in Star Wars it may be an entertaining movie but anyone who is into Star Wars will dislike the movie as it just copies a lot of  scenes from Episodes V and VI. Lazy.","true":true}
