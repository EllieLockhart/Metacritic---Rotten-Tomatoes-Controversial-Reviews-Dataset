Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just too much that didn't make sense. One example...Why would anyone make a flying craft with a skid that drags along the ground? Typical of movies these days that spend all of the budget on visual effects without formulating and interesting or cohesive story.","true":true}
