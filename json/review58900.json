Graphics and animations are some of the best I've seen. Did not agree with the story much. I would change the order of major events\\, and found that there were many characters that I did not care about and did not even remember the name of because of a lack of meaningful character development. Some characters I tried desperately to like (despite their controversial actions) ended up being very uninteresting and I found myself having to force myself to continue the game. I also found some major characters to be completely unlikable\\, yet the developers attempt to make us care and sympathize with them through very cheap tactics (namely forcing us to commit horrid acts to justify another characters actions). Older characters stray away from their established values and skills\\, with completely out-of-character actions with little to no logical explanation. Story is a very clich\u00e9 \\\"the cycle of revenge is bad\\\" plot and seems to make the player do terrible things simply to be edgy and create \\\"shock value\\\". The fact that much of the player base literally does not want to continue playing because they have to play as a certain character tells you enough about how unlikable some of the characters are. And no\\, successfully eliciting certain emotions from the player does not mean the story is good\\, it is because the first game's characters were so well developed that people are emotional as to what happens to them in a sequel. The story also feels dragged on almost double to how long it should have been\\, and I found myself completely losing motivation to continue playing. A story that subverts expectations isn't necessarily good. There is a good way to do it and a bad way to do it\\, and because the writers seem to only do this for shock value\\, I think this game does not execute this aspect well. Although I can appreciate many aspects of the game\\, such as graphics\\, animations\\, accessibility options\\, AI\\, sound design\\, level design\\, and voice actors\\, I overall cannot recommend this game because the story is such a pivotal component of something like The Last of Us\\, and it seems to be an extreme letdown compared to the first game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
