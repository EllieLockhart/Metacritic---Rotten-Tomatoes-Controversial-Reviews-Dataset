Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all: \u201cAmateurs give whole numbers as their reviews\u201d -Dave Portnoy One a scale of Phantom Menace (0 Stars) to Empire Strikes Back (5 Stars) this is a solid 3.5. Yes there are too many sub plots. Yes there are terrible forced jokes. Yes\\, OT characters need to be dealt with (because their actors don\u2019t live forever). Once you get past the mouth breathing heathens who write one sentence and one star reviews\\, the overall audience score would probably be at least a 75-80%. What\u2019s good about the movie is the whole concept of the plot\\, it\u2019s not like a typical Star Wars film when it deals with characters over months time in movies\\, rather it has a plot like Keanu Reeve\u2019s Movie \u201cSpeed.\u201d Essentially it is a Race against time in space to save the rebellion\\, not a whole campaign into destroying the Death Star or the entirety of the Clone Wars. Another good thing about this movie it is setting up the Star Wars Franchise for Darker movies (kinda how Harry Potter movies got darker over time). So along the line\\, this movie is teeing up the Darker overhanging themes for the future installments\\, in my opinion. ","true":true}
