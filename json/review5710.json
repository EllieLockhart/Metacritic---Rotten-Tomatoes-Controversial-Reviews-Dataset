Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Different\\, and I really wish they'd done more with two particular characters who go on a sad pointless journey that could have somehow been more meaningful. However\\, overall like the new direction and the \\\"handing the torch\\\" theme especially with some of the characters being\\, you know\\, dead for real outside the universe too (RIP Princess).","true":true}
