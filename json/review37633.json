Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much wrong with this movie\\, that discredits the Original Trilogy\\, Prequels and TFA. Johnson clearly has no idea who Luke Skywalker is or what he stands for. Space battles have been ruined (since when did lasers arc like artillery) and hyperspace... there are enough youtube videos already about that.\\nThe best send off for Carrie Fisher would have been Leia dying and NOT suddenly doing a Mary Poppins - it was good and heartfelt until that moment. \\nRose is the worst character ever and ruined Finn\\, who had the chance to redeem himself and was about to seemingly complete his arc and sacrifice himself for the republic\\, before Rose crashes into him (should have killed them) and then they have a soppy moment underneath the gaze of some walkers before miraculously making it back to the base... The more I think about this movie - the worse and worse it gets\\, I saw it twice\\, hoped I would like it more and only hope IX can make up for some of it. There are plenty of reviews on YouTube about the host of problems the movie unfortunately has.","true":true}
