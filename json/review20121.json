Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't a perfect film but I enjoyed it a lot... some don't like the twists and turns. However they were perfect for storytelling and character arc. Most people who hate on this film are blind\\, any sequel would be a disappointment to them. Sorry that the character you know and love don't always have sunshine and rainbows on his mind. It is not perfect\\, but the goods outshine the bads. A movie for people who appreciate film will love\\, and people who would like three hours of people standing and talking about the jedi order with jar jar binks will hate. Don't hate on the movie because you think it is cool to hate on it\\, it just gives you as little depth as Anikan from the prequels.","true":true}
