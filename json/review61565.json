We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is far from perfect\\, but it is the sequel that TLOU deserved. Well\\, first of all I don't even know what to say about the graphics and the gameplay\\, it is simply the perfect evolution of what the first game had created. The amount of animations made for the combat and all the little features that were added\\, like the silencer\\, are breathtaking and make the gameplay feel dynamic and as fluid as ever\\, and therefore making one of the best 3rd person games ever (gameplay wise). Naughty dog really nailed the techinical aspect\\, but now the story...\r\rI don't think that this game has a bad story\\, not at all\\,  it has the best premise that a TLOU sequel can get\\, taking one of the main characters and making him pay for all the stuff he made in the first game is simply the only plausible motivation that would make Ellie seek revenge at any cost. But I agree that the way in which they did it was pretty bad\\, I get that the TLOU world is cruel and that death is always around the corner\\, but it's f*cking Joel. I don't think that Joel deserved that miserable death\\, maybe he could've sacrificed himself for Tommy or something like that\\, because it really made him look weak.\r\rAs I said\\, I truly don't think that the story is bad\\, I just think that it is poorly told. I really appreciate the ambition of ND by making us see all the sides of the story\\, because after all\\, the last of us is a game about people\\, and not about Joel and Ellie. But they sure as hell shouldn't expect us to be happy by making us wait more than 10 hours to progress Ellie's story. I simply don't get why they needed to add 2 campaigns that are so long\\, maybe they could've made 1 day with Ellie and then 1 day with Abby so that we don't get so tired of expecting Ellie's story to come back. It would have the same effect that the devs intended\\, we kill everybody that day with Ellie and then see Abby's point of view of who they really are\\, instead of killing them and only seeing who they really are 15 hours later.\r\rPeople aren't complaining about the game because of the LGBT characters or the strong women in this game\\, it's just that the structure and pacing are horrible\\, and even though Abby's story is very interesting there's always that background thought wondering about what is going to happen with Tommy and Ellie that never goes away and that doesn't let us us enjoy Abby's plot as much as we should've. This isn't the game that we wanted\\, but it is the game that made sense as a sequel\\, I would give it 7.5 but since there isn't an option\\, I'm giving it an 8.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
