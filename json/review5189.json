Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear hardcore Star Wars fan\\,\\nF*$# off.\\nYou just don't get it. Star Wars is an adventure story. It is as epic as an ewok and as complex as saving the princess in the tower. It is a children movie and it is not supposed to grow an adult as you. Instead of spending $200 in a shitty Kylo Ren helmet buy a dinner to your loved one\\, take a course in writing and try to write a story and publish it\\, and have it under the same scrutiny you applied to this movie. Disney doesn't care about your opinion on the plot\\, they are busy doing something: entertaining us and making money in the process.\\n\\nDear hardcore Star Wars fan\\, you are a Simpsons joke. The only true Star Wars fans\\, are the children who are loving this movie. Shame on you for not growing up.","true":true}
