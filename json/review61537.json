You can have your opinion and disagree with some narrative choices\\, but Naughty Dog gave us a real story in a world where bad and horrible things happen. It was a story that needed to be told. And is brutally uncomfortable but equally astonishing. And you can\u2019t deny either how well-crafted it is as well as the heart and soul poured into bringing this game to life. The gameplay\\, the visuals\\, animations and graphics are unparalleled and situates this game in a whole other level. So thank you Naughty Dog for delivering such a complex and beautifully crafted story and video game.\r\rEven if leaks and spoilers \u201cruined it\u201d for you\\, give this game a chance. It is so much more than what you think it is or think you know. Play it\\, live through it and let it take you to one of the most gripping experiences a video game has ever delivered.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
