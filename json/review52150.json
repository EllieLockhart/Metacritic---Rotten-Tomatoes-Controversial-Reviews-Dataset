Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the great work done in TFA to set-up this film\\, it was a complete let disaster. Leia floating in space\\, flying back into the ship\\, and magically defying all common sense and coming back to life was the most absurd moment in the history of Star Wars. Zero character development for Rey\\, back peddling on Kylo\\, completely pointless story line for Finn\\, ruining Luke\\, I could go on and on. Horrible.","true":true}
