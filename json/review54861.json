Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's almost impossible to create new boundary-pushing content while there is a pack of wild\\, fickle\\, fans on your back clawing at your every decision. However\\, The Last Jedi seems to do just that. So\\, it's fitting that the small portion of singular\\, closed minded fans\\, along with the all-around intentionally divisive people\\, who both are now more than ever able to project their isolated opinions in all directions of the web\\, hate on the most popular movie in world. TFA was too similar. Now\\, TLJ is too different. This is a beautiful\\, shocking\\, fun\\, exciting\\, CREATIVE installment for The Star Wars saga. The fans don't make the movie\\, many hard-working professionals do. Stop being a bunch of middle-aged men griping about how they handled your childhood figurine. These movies are made for kids and young adults. I hope many families enjoy this movie (the third best IMO) for decades to come.","true":true}
