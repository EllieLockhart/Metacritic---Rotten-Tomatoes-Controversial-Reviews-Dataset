Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love watching movies and this movie had its great moments and cinematography but I wasn't completely hooked on it. Adam Driver is a great Sith Lord\\, Rey needs to be great in the next movie\\, Luke had his moments. I typically will watch Star Wars\/Marvel\/DC movies 2x in theaters but I'm going to wait for the 4K Bluray release.","true":true}
