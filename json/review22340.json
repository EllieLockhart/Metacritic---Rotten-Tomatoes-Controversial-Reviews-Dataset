Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi was a utter disappointment to say the least. A franchise that meant so much growing up and into modern day was literally butchered.\\n\\n They should attempt to rescind this sad attempt at reviving a once great storyline and franchise. George Lucas should be ashamed that this has what has become Star Wars.","true":true}
