Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"That's not how the Force works!\\\" -Han Solo\\n\\nI am really disappointed in how this movie trashed everything TFA and all the other Star Wars movies created.  I still can't believe this movie was made.  What is more disturbing is how the \\\"critics\\\" rave about this movie.  Not only is it not a good Star Wars movie\\, it is not a good movie PERIOD.  I am still upset a week after I watched this disaster.  I am never going to wear my Last Jedi shirt again.","true":true}
