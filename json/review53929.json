Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"huge star wars fan here.  collect all the legos sets for my game room. spent way too much money on star war items.  of course ive seen all the movies countless times.  I spent 2 years waiting for this movie.  Have to admit when the movie ended both me and my wife looked at each other confused.  this was such a terrible movie.  the script was terrible.  Fin and rose story plot was absolutely unnecessary and pointless.   Luke's character direction was an absolute disrespect to the whole series.  The director needs to be fired.  He needs to go back to directing school or something.  And he has control of a future trilogy... no thank you Disney.  I'll find better ways to spend my money.  The point is to make a movie people will mostly enjoy.  All Rian Johnson did was make Star Wars fan hate Starwars.  The director definitely ruined the whole Star Wars universe with this crap fest of a movie.","true":true}
