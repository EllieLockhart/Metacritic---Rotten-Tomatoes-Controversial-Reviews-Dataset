Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a fun ride. I think people are rating it too harshly after a single viewing. I've seen it 3 times and it gets better with every viewing I pick up more intricate details. This movie is a think piece on the nature of good and evil in a non-traditional Star Wars way and the theme of failure and why it's important is ever present and can teach a great lesson. Symbolism heavy\\, but it's worth it. It does have pacing issues in the middle because of a certain plot that is only there to service characters\\, but the more I watch it the more I realize that despite these issues it's still very much enjoyable.","true":true}
