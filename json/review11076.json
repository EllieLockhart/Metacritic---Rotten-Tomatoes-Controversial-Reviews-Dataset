Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u201cHe\u2019s not my Luke Skywalker\u201d-Mark Hamill Disney\u2019s Last Jedi is not my Star Wars. Rian Johnson and Disney (and the critic$) should be ashamed of putting out and promoting this poorly thought out \u201cmovie\u201d. This movie is plagued with Poor storytelling\\, unnecessarily plot \u201csurprises\u201d\\, forced humor and cardboard characters. With a much deserved 53% audience rating\\, it\u2019s \u201cas if a million voices suddenly cried out in terror\u201d with how bad Disney botched this one. ","true":true}
