Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films ever made. People who seriously think that this film is worse than the prequels need to go watch the prequels again. Bad writing? The writing in the prequels nearly killed me. This film has so many good performances. Mark Hamill is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING as a Luke Skywalker who is tortured by his past. Adam Driver? Excellent. Daisy Ridley? A VAST improvement over her appearance in the Force Awakens. \\nSo many surprises and amazing additions to the canon that I'm SO surprised that audiences aren't enjoying this film. Whatever. I LOVED IT.","true":true}
