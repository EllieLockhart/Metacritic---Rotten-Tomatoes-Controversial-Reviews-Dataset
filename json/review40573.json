Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars film ever. It disrespects the original trilogy and completely undoes everything that was accomplished in it. Rey is a Mary Sue with no background or explanation to where her power comes from. The writing is lazy and stupid. This film relies so heavily on cgi that if you take it out you are left with a couple of bad actors (apart from mark Hamill who tried his best\\,) an awful story that goes no where\\, characters who have no depth or background and a film that destroys all hopes and expectations of what fans wanted it to be. (Ps the way the failure of this film was handled was so awful it has made me lose all respect for Rian Johnson and Disney)","true":true}
