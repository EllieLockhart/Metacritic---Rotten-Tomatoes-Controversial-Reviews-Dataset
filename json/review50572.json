Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(4.5\/5). Despite what the butthurt fanboys will have you belive\\, this is a great movie. It has great themes of leadership and letting the past die\\, for the most part it has strong characters. The dynamic between Kylo and Rey is even stronger here in this film\\, and I admired most of the things Rian Johnson did with the mythos of the force. The whole casino subplot sidetracks the film a bit\\, and it makes the movie longer than it needs to be but the rest of the film makes up for it. It also features one of the best performances Mark Hamill has ever given. Looking forward to Ep. 9!","true":true}
