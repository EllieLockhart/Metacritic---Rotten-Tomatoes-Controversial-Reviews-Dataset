Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Makes it a mission to detract from the decent \\\"Force Awakens\\\".\\nStupifying amount of plotholes. Weird pacing. \\nHumor which seems completely out of place.\\nStory-arcs of characters are underwhelming\\, particularly Rey whom I liked in \\\"Force Awakens\\\". (She is now a fully-fledged Mary Sue)\\nThe character of Luke Skywalker is completely disrespected and doesn't line up with previous iterations whatsoever.\\nThis killed the movie for me\\, which is a shame since Mark Hamill's acting is spot-on.\\nInconsistencies with \\\"the force\\\" greatly undermines its mystery.\\nAwful implementation of social and political messaging at the expense of good character-development.\\n\\nThe movie has great visuals and effects (Mary Poppins aside)\\, that deserves a star\\n\\nThe prequels nearly destroyed Star Wars\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" finally succeeded.","true":true}
