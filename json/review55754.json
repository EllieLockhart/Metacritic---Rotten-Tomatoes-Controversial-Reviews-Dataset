Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, Last Jedi is an insult to Star Wars. It is a planned and directed insult to the Baby boomers\\, and especially Generations X and Y. It's not that they killed off our heroes \\, Han and Luke\\, it's that they told us that they didn't matter. That they were broken old men who failed in their naive attempt to make the universe a better place. They were broken and sad and lost and without hope. There was no generational passing of the baton\\, and no joy\\, as there was for Luke and old Ben. It's telling the post Vietnam generation you failed\\, Vietnam happened\\, watergate happened\\, you thought you could make the world different and now we have trump and Star Wars has kylo ren. Rather than the generations coming together and healing rifts there was no healing\\, just collapse and death and knowing Luke didn't matter. The fact that he is a \\\"symbol\\\" for the future doesn't change that that symbol was based on a myth\\, a falsehood\\, and that Luke died a broken man w no hope. Luke tossing away his father's Lightsaber? Luke never embracing the Jedi again? Luke just going into exile to die meekly? This was antithetical to Lucas vision of healing the generational 60s divide and bringing hope. The world is already bad enough\\, I don't need Star Wars to offer no hope for change. Moreover\\, to have Carrie Fisher die and Leia to live is a creepy metaphorical holding onto her corpse. As Mark Hammil said\\, it's not his or our Luke. We get the message - move on and let go of the past. Okay\\, we will. Last Jedi equals last Star Wars movie. It's over. We are going to take our memory of Luke and Han and Leia as they should be before this film mischaracterized them and you millenials can have Rose and Finn.  Then\\, to add insult to injury\\, the entire film is one screed against masculinity and men and emasculates Oscar Isaac's character every chance it gets with a purple haired Laura Dern playing a mean kindergarten teacher turned vice admiral.  Look\\, Star War is...well\\, It's over. New hope is gone. Peace out. A long time Star war fan letting it go and not coming back.","true":true}
