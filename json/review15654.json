Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this film! I am a huge fan of Star Wars and my overall impression awards this movie a 5 Star rating . . . Yes there are some fans that were not impressed by this film\\, I don't\\, or rather cant understand their rational behind it. Simply there are an equal amount of fans who loved it and those who are in absolute outrage\\, mostly due to the fact that\\, quite possibly\\, the movie didn't meet their expectations\\, even after countless theories surfaced on YouTube. . .  Yeah!\\, theories that were thought to be the only logical explanation were blown out of the water. . .  I honestly think this was an original film that delivered some more unexpected twist that left me overwhelmed. \\n\\nDirector Rian Johnson\\, I commend you on your tactfulness and courage to do something unexpected\\, The movie in my conclusion is a great one. Undoubtably I had my theories\\, I had my expectations and I too was pleasantly surprised by the direction you had taken with this movie. All I can say\\, it was beautifully executed!\\n\\nI am thrilled to have experienced this movie for all its excitement and visually amazing effects. Its a film filled with laughter\\, adventure and more epic moments that will be long remembered. I share the critics sentiments in saying this is one of the best by far. Ill be seeing this movie again and again until it is pulled from the circuit.","true":true}
