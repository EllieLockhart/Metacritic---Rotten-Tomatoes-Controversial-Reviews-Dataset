Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont care that Luke is a grouchy old hermit\\, or that Snoke gets killed off\\, or that Rey' s parents are nobodies.  I'm good with those elements! The problem is that much of the film could have been handled better\\, and with more appreciation of Star Wars heritage and tradition.   The slapstick humor was just awful. Luke throwing the lightsaber over his shoulder like it was nothing made me cringe.  They could have at least mirrored the Arthurian Legends and had him throw the saber into the ocean\\, similar to Excalibur  being thrown into the lake.  There  are lots of other problems with the movie but you can read about those on other reviews.  I will give credit where credit is due\\,  one performance to me stood out above the others.  The British resistance woman who gathers everyone together to discuss the line of succession and announce Admiral Holdo...   her performance in that scene was outstanding.  the Expressions on her face and the way she tells of everyone on the bridge including Admiral Ackbar being killed was one of the few points in the movie where you felt emotionally connected to the story.","true":true}
