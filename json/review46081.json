Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning! However the movie was filled with plot holes accompanied by the murder of almost every sub plot that was brilliant set up by the force awakens. Rey is way to powerful for no reason\\, Kylo is underutilized. The humor fell flat and rudely interrupted every serious moment the film had to offer.","true":true}
