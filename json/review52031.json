Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After going in with high hopes and a love of the franchise\\, I can\u2019t tell you how disappointed I am with this film. A story full of plot holes\\, unresolved questions\\, unneeded side stories and many underwhelming performances from new and older faces. We have sunk to what might end up as the worst film of the series. I appreciate those who are trying to stay positive but their are too many ridiculous scenes\\, uninspired characters being played by performers who don\u2019t seem to want to play them and and overall effort that makes Lucas\u2019 prequels look much better. Go see the film and draw your conclusion but don\u2019t be surprised if you leave the theater sad and disappointed. ","true":true}
