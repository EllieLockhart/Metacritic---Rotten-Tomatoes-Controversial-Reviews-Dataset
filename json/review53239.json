Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bunch of politically correct nonsense.\\n\\nThe message of the movie is basically that men suck (they are dumb and impulsive) and we should just put women in charge and do whatever they say. I felt like I was watching a Lifetime movie.\\n\\nPoor Mark Hamill.   They turned Luke Skywalker into a grumpy angry psycho and then threw him to the garbage. \\n\\nVery disrespectful to the fans of the franchise","true":true}
