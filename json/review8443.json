Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film that will surely divide the public. I personally found it not without defects\\, but at the same time powerful and iconographic. The rhythm in some moments is fluctuating and the subplot linked to Finn and Rose remains useless\\, the character of Phasma remains undeveloped. Despite these defects the film is powerful in many scenes that will surely remain in the collective imagination of the fans. Awesome photography that in some scenes reminds a Japanese film. Well-measured fan service to support the plot. Twists that displace the viewer and give new life to the plot. Moving ending that does justice to certain characters and projects us towards the future of the saga. Good Job Rian Johnson","true":true}
