Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im in love with this movie. So much more then I thought it would be... everything just turned upside down and the shake up in universe is gonna be one hell of a ride...People seem to really love rogue one and I found it just okay-ish.TLJ however just blew it out of the park for me and rekindled all my love for the franchise and the future of this universe.","true":true}
