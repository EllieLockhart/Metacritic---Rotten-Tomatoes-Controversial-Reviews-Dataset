Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is a beloved sci fi fantasy franchise but this was a left wing\\, gender politics mess with poor writing and shallow characters. Rey is a Mary Sue\\, more powerful than anyone with no training and no explanation. See GOT FOR A GOOD FEMALE LEAD. Rose was awful and pointless\\, Luke was someone altogether different\\, story was weak and made no sense.","true":true}
