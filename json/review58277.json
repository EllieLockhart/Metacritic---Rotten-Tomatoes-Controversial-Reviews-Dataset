Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely awful. It didn't carry on from any of the previous story ties left by JJ Abrams in the previous title. It was almost like Rian Johnson thought \\\"thi s is my time to shine...\\\" hoisted up his big boy pants\\, and proceeded to make this god-awful sequel. If like me you grew up with watching the original trilogy on VHS tapes\\, you will be angered by the way Mark Hamill leaves the series. Full of unnecessary plot holes\\, unanswered questions and down-right let downs... I am going to say it - seeing this actually made me miss the days of Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
