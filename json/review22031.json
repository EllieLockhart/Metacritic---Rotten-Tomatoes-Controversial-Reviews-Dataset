Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watched the latest Star Wars movie\\, it really must be the worst movie in the saga to date. An incoherent pile of poo with a Mary popins moment and defo reference to Avengers superhero and the marvel like movies. The movie is absolute dog poo and undignified to show many loyal fans over the last 40 years. Apparently having the force these days enables to be resurrected\\, travel through space unsuited and be able to move a mountain of rock with 3 days training and drink milk by a massive alien cow. All the characters that either meant something and had a purpose are now either dead or running with meaningless subplots that amount to...well nothing. How in the name of reason all these so-called critics are finding this catastrophe a game-changing movie? They are either on the payroll of retarded! Seriously I'm done with Disney and the PC adolescent crap they tried to cram and sell as a movie. The director of the movie managed to destroy the franchise\\, well done u muppet! I need to watch Rogue 1 please a few times to cleanse the stench of the rubbish I just watched. QQ what the hell was the Finn subplot all about? Btw i took my kid\\, nephew and niece all between 8 and 15. The two young ones kept asking me when is the movie finishing? The movie is rubbish and we should call it what it is. Dont dress it up!","true":true}
