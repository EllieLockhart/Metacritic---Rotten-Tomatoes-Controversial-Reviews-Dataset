We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part II deals in some aspects that I've never seen in a game before. It respects the true narrative of Ellie's story\\, as she's not the sweet girl from before the final act of the first game. A lot has gone through her mind in those years after the hospital massacre.. she feels guilty about those lives taken by Joel\\, but she also wants to forgive him\\, and that's brilliantly shown in the flashbacks. Of course\\, the narrative could've been different\\, and that's my issue\\, but that's art. The concept of art is not giving us what we want\\, but to give us something from the point of view of the artist. I've become very found of Abby\\, as I learned her story. She's a victim of Joel's rampage to save Ellie and that's one of the reasons I think she spared Abby in the end. Joel loved Ellie\\, but he was traumatized by what happened to Sarah and his wife\\, in that he couldn't bare to lose the last person he really cared about (of course there's Tommy\\, but you know what I mean). The things he did culminated on his death\\, and the narrative does not have flaws right here.\rThe gameplay and graphics are incredible. I grew tired of the same stealth kill animations after sometime\\, and that's my main issue. It's a stealth game\\, they should've invested more on this.\rThe story is not for everyone. If you're someone who sees same sex relationships with prejudice and disrespect\\, you should not play this game.. actually you should stick to games with muscular men and things like that (every homophobic has a fragile masculinity). Other than that\\, the story is painful. Heavy. And you need to pay attention to everything so you don't become an internet troll\\, throwing in the trash the effort of the people involved in this amazing project.\rA great game. Surely GOTY 2020!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
