Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very worthy addition to the saga\\, taking it in new directions and closing off\/finishing others.  It was fun and exciting\\, great entertainment.  A bit long\\, and suffers from the 'Avengers' syndrome of every character needing their moment.  But overall a terrific\\, fun movie.","true":true}
