Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ranks No. 5 in my Star Wars Episodes filmography\\, just above the prequels. It\u2019s not better than Rogue One\\, either. The film lacks a good script\\, tries to run several sub stories\\, but fails to concrete. The new characters do not develop in relevance\\, even though it is clear that the director and producers are trying to shift the weight of the saga on them. It lacks a very important element within a lightsaber fight that all the other movies have. Some scenes and humor did not have to be there for the plot to move along. The parts that I liked\\, I liked a lot. But the parts that I hated\\, really spoiled the movie for me. The previous episode set very well the plot for a great follow up\\, but this director fails on almost all of those points. He decided to bring in new aspects into a \u201cuniverse\u201d that was very well created and explained for 40 years. I\u2019m not interested in watching his approach to a new trilogy. Disney can have the rights to SW\\, but SW is not Mary Poppins!","true":true}
