Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One fairly obvious plot weirdness (the amazing effectiveness of lightspeed as a weapon) prevents it from getting a full score\\, but it was an enjoyable and unpredictable view. Refreshing after 4 episodes (the prequels\\, and the force awakens to a lesser degree) that had very little to offer in terms of plot.","true":true}
