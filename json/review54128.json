Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed parts of this movie but I\u2019m overwhelmed by senses of disappointment and astonishment of what I have witnessed. If you are not super into Star Wars but are interested in watching this you\u2019ll probably like it. BUT if you are a Star Wars fan and are into this story and have a love for this franchise\\, this will disappoint you greatly. Not only does it ruin some chances for the some of the most epic moments in Star Wars history\\, but it also throws away everything you held dear about this franchise. I don\u2019t want to get into spoilers but there are just straight up ridiculous parts that don\u2019t make any sense even for Star Wars and it misses out on something that could have been great. I went into this movie with high hopes and was left with nothing more than longing for what could have been. I truly hope that this man never makes another Star Wars movie again and that they miraculously make up for everything in episode IX but I don\u2019t see how they can. ","true":true}
