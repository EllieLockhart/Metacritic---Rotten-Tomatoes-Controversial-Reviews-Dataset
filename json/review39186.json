Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This felt like someone pitched a bunch of really cool scenes regardless of whether they matched previous cannon\\, previously established characters\\, the previous movie\\, or even this very same movie. \\n\\nIt's a disjointed\\, incoherent story and it's a crying shame that the creators can't respect that while visual oos and ahhs drives up the box office the heart and soul of star wars has always been the story.  \\n\\nTo call the scenes duct taped together is a disservice to the wonders of our shiny grey friend.","true":true}
