Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One as a stand alone was more connected to the Star Wars universe than TLJ. I felt like Johnson went out of his way to make sure that none and I mean none of the fan theories about anything were true. And not only that but I almost felt offended\\, like Johnson was sort of making a mockery of things the fans care so deeply about. Fans waited two years to see Rey and Luke meet. Johnson asked Abrams to change the end of Force Awakens so he could have that moment and he turns it into a joke. One of the biggest theories debated between fans was Snoke and he was made utterly insignificant. I'm not saying that Johnson should have run around paying fan service but Star Wars is steeped in mythology that we all care very deeply about. If everything is meaningless\\, if the characters we are all trying so hard to care about are no one\\, then Johnson just simply doesn't get it. Rogue One was more connected to the Skywalker trilogies than this movie. I've seen it twice and still walked away feeling like my dog just got hit by a car.","true":true}
