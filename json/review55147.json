{"101487":147052,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed with the movie.  The arc of Luke was just wasted.  He didn't really get to train Rey at all.  They took a major fan favorite\\, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker\\, and turned him into a sad old hermit who is crippled with guilt and shows up once as a projection and then dies... he shouldn't have died in this movie.  Send him out in the next movie in some glorious fashion like he deserves.  \\n\\nFloating space Leia was awful\\, the fact that she survives it\\, while also no longer being alive in real life was surprising and confusing.  Yoda appearing for 30 seconds to say 3 things was pointless.  Chewie was underused.  The casino\/weird horseracing scenes were really un-necessary.  The humor was forced and not funny.  The end battle scene was a big letdown too.  They did not expand on Snoke's story arc at all.  Why did so many rebels die\\, did anyone else notice it was a ton of them?  Yet there is no one powerful leader of the First Order\\, just a bunch of stormtroopers and one Sith...\\n\\nThe Kylo Ren and Rey scenes were great.  The lightsaber duels were pretty good.  The space battles were by far the best.  Rey was great although somehow very good at using the force and a lightsaber with very very little training... \\n\\nI feel like the entire movie was a missed opportunity.  Easily my least favorite Star Wars film.","true":true}
