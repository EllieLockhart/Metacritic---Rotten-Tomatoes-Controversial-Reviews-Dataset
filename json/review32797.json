Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was fantastic. The negative reviews mostly come from whiny fanboys who want to see the old movies with new lines\\, but the beautiful thing about TLJ is its rebirth of the resistance. We introduce new characters who give us new perspectives on the war\\, we see the resistance inspire the downtrodden\\, and we see the fall of a reliance on bloodlines to continue the powers of the force. Characters from past movies are given beautiful arcs. The old order is burning down. A new generation with is rising. The fate of the universe is up in the air\\, what will the future hold as the dark and the light become increasingly grey.","true":true}
