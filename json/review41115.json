Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had some of the best and worst moments in Star Wars history. There are obvious moments where you're hyped up on adrenaline because what's occurring in front of you is so cool and other moments where you sit back and ask \\\"What just happened?\\\" It's not better than Episode V\\, but it's not abysmal. There is a good bit of juvenile humor but it's not important.","true":true}
