Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars installments. I was extremely disappointed by The Force Awakens\\,  but The Last Jedi makes up for it in bounds. There were quite a few unexpected events\\, great character interactions\\, fun side adventures\\, and some great new characters. The overall pacing of the movie was fantastic and I enjoyed the ending not being your typical Marvel ending. There were also some great dialog throughout the movie\\, with far fewer one liners than expected. Lastly\\, I really liked them wiping the slate in terms of the lore with the Jedi and Sith\\, we had 7 movies of that\\, it's time for a new adventure and new lore.","true":true}
