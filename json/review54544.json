Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long time Star Wars fan and even survived the prequels. However\\, this was the movie that caused me to abandon all hope and will be the last I bother seeing in the theater. Insane plot holes\\, lots of questionable \\\"science\\,\\\" terrible plot devices\\, awkwardly inserted comedy (like a bad attempt to mimic Marvel)\\, bad CGI\\, overly long movie that had me checking the time -- I could go on and on. Just as The Force Awakens felt like a reshoot of A New Hope\\, this felt like a strange mashup of scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
