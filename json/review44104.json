Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was a real disappointment. For one there was lots of plot holes that I could not overlook. Manly though I was disappointed with the story and the direction the film took. I thought it was going to be a grittier darker film like the Empire Strikes back but it didn't even come close. Also i thought it would expand the characters and their past but didn't do any of that either. Overall I thought it was really bad. I will probably watch it again someday but I doubt it will change m opinion.","true":true}
