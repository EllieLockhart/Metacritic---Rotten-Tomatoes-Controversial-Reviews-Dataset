Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film reached a new low\\n\\nIts infused with politics. All the audience hate is valid folks. I lean left from center politically and this movie is annoying as heck. Black guy as main role...great. Women in main roles...great. The original star wars did exactly the same thing woop dee doo.Black guy and asian chick in love....awesome! cue to marvin gaye for a bit of interracial heat. \\n\\nNow -> Insert 2017 mind-deranged leftists cult members to produce the film. Please just take all this is stride.....Women stronger than men throughout film......what?. Most of the military leaders all wise old women.....okay :S. \\nFemale lead physically stronger than male antagonist who is 3 times her size in major battle.....sure!\\, The ONLY Male fighter trying to win the battle is ridiculed as reckless \\\"fly boy\\\" amongst many generalised \\\"fly boys\\\" and needs to be yes\\, needs to be slapped in the face and demoted after destroying the enemy ship. Thats it. Sorry Im done. Men are muppets\\, women are angels of course of course\\,.......let me out of this brain washing hell hole please. \\n\\nNope. That ideological club just keeps on hitting you over the head AGAIN.........and....... AGAIN.....and again until your wondering why you liked star wars in the first place.","true":true}
