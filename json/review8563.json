Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First movie I ever saw was Return of the Jedi. I was six. Suffice to say that I am a rabid fan\\, along with my whole family.\\nOnly thing I can say about this installment\\, that I was shocked...in a good way.\\nI do think that there were certain plot elements that were unnecessary which added couple of minutes to the length.\\nThe director wiped the slate clean and passed on the torch to the next generation.\\nYou just have to throw out any  prejudice and pre-formed opinion if you have any\\, before going to see the movie.\\nEnjoy","true":true}
