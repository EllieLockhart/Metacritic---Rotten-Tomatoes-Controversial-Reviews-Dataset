Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie can be summed up in one word. Unnecessary!! This beautiful Movie has inherited a world without limit and a great classic story that has been reduced to after school special writing ( think divergent series) and at times cringe worthy dialogue and ( unintentional) laugh out loud scenes wasting the talent of many actors. The story is not bad\\, and far better than the carbon copy that was the force awakens\\, but too many times did I think\\, well that was unnecessary. The opening scene that played out like a bad Verizon commercial... extremely unimaginative\\, silly\\, and... VERY Unnecessary. Adding the terrible storyline of Rose.. Unnecessary .Benicio Del Toro\\, Laura Dern.. Unnecessary. Leia flying through space... you guessed it.. Unnecessary! Having said all that this is a gorgeous movie to look at and\\, at times you can overlook the films silly nature and lost art of storytelling to transport into that world\\, but don't expect a good movie bc it just isn't. The truly sad part is it could have been!","true":true}
