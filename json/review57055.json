Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is very confusing to me. Visually\\, it was amazing. The cinematography and sound were great\\, a true technical masterpiece. However\\, from a narrative standpoint\\, it was a disappointment. The humour was jarring and out of place\\, plot points from the force awakens were resolved in a haphazard manner\\, and the nonsensical subplots ie Rose and Finn's Disney casino adventure and cringy love story was a massive letdown for me. Nonetheless\\, I was sufficiently entertained\\, but I won't be rewatching this movie like how I rewatched the original trilogy a hundred times","true":true}
