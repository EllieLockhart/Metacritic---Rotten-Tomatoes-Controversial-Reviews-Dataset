Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was astounded by The Last Jedi. People seem to think that Star Wars movies are exempt to flaws and \\\"boring\\\" moments. There are always going to be a couple things here and there that you aren't sure about\\, but just keep asking yourself questions about what might happen next rather than posing a judgement before the movie is over. The plot was complex and interestingly woven\\, and I was never able to correctly predict what would happen next. That's one thing that makes these movies great and this film outdid its predecessors in that category. The fight scenes were also marvelous. The Last Jedi did just about everything right\\, which\\, in my book\\, earns 5 stars.","true":true}
