Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite a sloggy start\\, and at least two \\\"wait\\, it's not over yet\\\" moments... I really thoroughly enjoyed this. While I didn't love every choice the writer\/director made - it felt like life. You want certain things to happen; some do and some don't. But\\, what happens in the end is usually exactly what you need.","true":true}
