Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Simplesmente fant\u00e1stico\\, o jogo se aprofunda no ciclo do \u00f3dio\\, o Joel matou o pai da Abby para salvar a Ellie sem pensar nas consequ\u00eancias. Destruiu a \u00faltima esperan\u00e7a da humanidade de criar uma vacina para erradicar a pandemia e pensou somente nele mesmo.
