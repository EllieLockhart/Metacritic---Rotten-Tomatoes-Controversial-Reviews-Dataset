Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this all boils down to the handling of Luke Skywalker. To pretend it's not is as a disservice to star wars as The Last Jedi was. I know what they were trying to do here\\, and what they NEED to do is basically get rid of all the old and in with the new. But they blew it.  They blew a chance to have Luke go out with a real bang and epic ending to essentially pass your care onto the new characters. What happened in the Last Jedi should have happened in the last movie in such a way that created an epic end to a most beloved character.  The movie on it's own breaks several sub plots and even main plots it seems from The Force awakens.   More care in the subject material was needed and it just wasn't there.","true":true}
