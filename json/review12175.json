Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a new user and yes i create an account just to rate this piece of s**t that call itself a Star Wars movie. This movie is not a star wars movie. \\nI really would love this movie\\, and i wait it so much.. to be so disapointed.\\nI'm deeply hurt. Rian Johnson made something really really really bad.\\nIn this movie\\, almost each scene got his plothole. It's just insane.\\nI'm sad.","true":true}
