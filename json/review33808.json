Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Turned Star Wars into a Marvel film. Primary plot device is a spaceship running out of fuel. Character development from the previous The Force Awakens movie is a complete let down. Movies are only as good as their villains\\, and TLJ completely succeeds in making its villains bland and uninteresting. Overall a plodding and disjointed movie very different from TFA and Rogue One (both of which I enjoyed).","true":true}
