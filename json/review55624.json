Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what everyone was expecting but this was full of unexpected surprises and leaves you wanting more more more. An original story with just a splash of throw back to the previous installments. This is a fresh direction for the franchise and is worth multiple watches to catch all the details it offers.
