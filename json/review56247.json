Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a well directed film\\, however\\, a beautiful shot-list and CGI is not enough to save its poor screenplay\\, and its several continuity errors\/plot holes that tarnish the legacy of the original and prequel trilogies\\, and even interrupts the intriguing aspects of Episode VII. I was expecting this film to challenge my perceptions of why the Jedi Order is needed. It did not do that. I was expecting the film to expand on who Rey was. It did not do that. I expected this film to tell me something original. It did not do that AT ALL. \\n\\nThe film gives focus to the weird to subplots (SPOILER: the plot between Finn and Rose) and with that seems to elude detail that we actually need (I.E. the characterization of the Supreme Leader. More about Rey's training etc.) And something in which all fans are upset about\\, which too\\, upset me dearly was the characterization of Luke. Master Skywalker was always a beacon of hope and believed so faithfully in the Jedi order\\, yet the film seems to have tarnished this and does not give great explanation to this change in ideology. Instead of exploring this change\\, we're given a roughly 1 minute flashback\\, which brings us to the next problem: the film tries to do too much in its time. Several things could've be cut. Hint: Finn's subplot. Character development\\, too\\, seems obsolete in the film. \\n\\nAll in all the film is a major disappointment: it's inability to cash in on the intriguing aspects of Episode VII brought on by JJ\\, and its ignorance towards the two trilogies has made The Last Jedi\\, one of the worst\\, if not the worst entry to the saga. With Episode VII\\, itself being quite weak in storytelling\\, we are being shown the true need for George Lucas to return to the helm. Even though this is an impossibility\\, perhaps he is the only hope to save the sequel trilogy from damnation.","true":true}
