Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Adam Driver delivered a powerful and emotive portrayal of Kyle Ren that almost made me forgive the disappointing and distracting casting choices for Anakin. Well directed and edited\\, loved it!","true":true}
