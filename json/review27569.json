Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall this film is bloated and incoherent\\, a significant amount of screen time is spent on plot arcs that go nowhere. Humour is so self aware that I was expecting a cast member to turn and wink at the camera at any moment. There are moments which hint at an unrealised potential and some impressive visual set-pieces but it all feels so hollow and lacks both the charm and the solemnity of the original trilogy.\\n\\nHopefully interest will begin to dwindle in more Star Wars movies after this fiasco.","true":true}
