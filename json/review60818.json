Soo reading and watching a lot of reviews\\, and also playing the game to the end my thoughts and feelings for this game is definitely mixed especially playing abi after she kills two characters. I loved the gameplay and graphics. Loved the cutscenes and more so loved the emotion behind ellies character. But as soon as you play abi\\, oh damn I hated it and I just wanted to stop playing but I forced myself despite hating and \\\"accidentally\\\" killing myself as her a few times lol. I got to the point where there was a flashback for Abi with her father ad the one where she rushed in to the room where Joel kills her father I immediately took an understanding as to why she killed Joel. But here's the thing I felt forced emotionally to feel sympathy for her and why she did the things she did. So I kept playing having a sense of enjoyment but still a load of hate for this one character. The whole story is about revenge obviously. But starting to actually look at it as  revenge story for both Ellie and abi. Overall there is three key parts in the game that I really had a distaste for. One was Ellie killing the dog (fair enough I killed a lot of dogs in this game\\, sorta reminds me of old tomb raider ps1\/2 days) but the one dog the games legit gets you a emotional connection with. Then second is when you beat Ellie almost to death and then almost kill dina. Ohhh why did it force me to go through this trauma. I just really agonised over this for a few hours. Then thirdly the farm seen with jj and dina and Ellie living happily ever after or not for Ellie ptsd destroyed Ellie and it throws you into an emotional whirlwind and makes you think crap this feels like an ending that I really don't want to see. But thankfully the story goes on for another 1\/2hour but it felt rushed like seriously rushed. I had the same feeling with ff15 ending. I get why she left abi alive but I also felt empty at this point. And felt so much mental and emotional damage at this point for both characters I didn't even wanna fight. Now I actually love the game but I have so much mixed and **** up feelings for it. And putting myself into both ellies and abis shoes I understood why they both did or didn't do the things they did. This game gives me a whole feeling of walking dead vibe when neegan is first introduced\\, you hate the mother **** for killing peeps but then at certain points the show tries to make you love him (tbf I really do love neegan) but that's the feeling I get that naughty dog tried to do with the whole abi revenge plot but it sorta fails in a way because it makes you feel forced to show sympathy. I can't give it a low score or a high score but I really do love this game to an extent that sorta brushes off abi killing Joel but it makes it hard when she almost kills Ellie and dina. I really wouldn't recommend this game if you suffer from mental health issues because it would trigger you to high hell but I also recommend it to peeps because it's actually a good game just a few parts that damages you\u2026 Expand","true":true}
