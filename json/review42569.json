Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a terrible sequel. Almost every star wars movie has a time skip of 2-3 years. This movie picked up where the last left off and in no way did it improve the story. Luke Skywalker turned to complete crap\\, rose should be killed off\\, leia was just weird. Finn was just useless. Disney ruined star wars and that faxx. Snoke was a more shittier villain then broly.","true":true}
