Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has everything.  Great light saber fight scenes\\, awesome battle scenes\\, humor\\, drama\\, and questions.  I am not sure why people dislike this movie.  I don't know what they want but for me I was taken back to the feelings of wonder I had watching the original Star Wars and Empire in the movie theatre when they were released.","true":true}
