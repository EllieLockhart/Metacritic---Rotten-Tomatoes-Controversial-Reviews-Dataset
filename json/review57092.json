Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a bad movie. The plot is farcical and degrades the other movies especially Awakens. The jokes are simple and fall flat. The New Order is reimagined into something out of Spaceballs. They pose no menace\\, have no military capabilities and have no explanation for their actions. Its shot very clear and bright with a focus on full screen close ups which gives a made for TV feel. The movie also relies on re-using of previous scenes and character steps from the earlier movies\\, remaking some classic scenes frame for frame - Return Of the Jedi Death star run???? Oh but luke does have a bukkake scene with a walrus so thats something new.","true":true}
