{"101487":155802,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never given a review for a film before\\, but this \\\"hideous thing\\\" needs to be spanked\\, very hard.\\nI have loved all of the star wars films\\, yes all of them (TFA and RO as well). I know some of the prequals were a bit iffy at times\\, but they had a half decent story and stuck to the rules and limitations of the this universe.\\n\\\"Star Wars\\\" - The last jedi (if we can call it that\\, to me this is not a star wars film) is totally shocking and not in a good way. Very poor indeed.\\n\\nFor the last week i have been pondering just what the feck Rian Johnson was thinking? And even now\\, i cannot answer that question.\\n\\nI have read some theory's that what was done\\, was done to clear the way for the new characters. WHY? there is only one film left to go in this triology.\\nIf they want to change the rules of the universe\\, that is fine. Just start a new story\/triology and leave the old one alone. Do not trash it like this. Note: if Rian is writing and directing it\\, it will be shit like this film and i will give it a miss.\\n\\nI have also read \\\"fans\\\" saying they love the last jedi\\, but can understand why others hate it. So they know deep down that something is wrong with the film?\\n\\n\\nI hope some folks at LFL and Disney read some of these comments and take note.\\nThis is the first star wars film that i wont buy on disk.\\n\\nP.S for anyone wondering\\, the film is shit and i didnt like it. Oh and by the way\\, i am not a bot or a hack or whatever other excuse you want to give for such a poor rating. It gets half a star because that is the lowest possible score to give and that is exactly what this \\\"film\\\" deserves.\\n\\nAvoid! like the plague if you are a true star wars fan.","true":true}
