Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know I'm in the minority here\\, but I like The Last Jedi. Of course\\, it's far from being on the best Star Wars movies\\, but it is definitely the best out of the three on the Disney trilogy (understanding that overall\\, is the weakest trilogy). First of all\\, I want to clarify: yes\\, the Kanto Bai sequence is just a waste of time\\, some characters are not useful to the story\\, and it loses the opportunity of being awesome on some key moments. \\n\\nNow\\, with that out of the way\\, I have to say\\, when this movie does something good\\, it nails it. Closure to Luke Skywalker? Yes (and I totally understand his mood through the movie). Twists? Yes!! Awesome cinematography? The best in a long time. Thanks to this movie I understand Kylo Ren better\\, and I love the fact that the movie states the force as something universal\\, and not so much about lineages and families. \\n\\nAgain\\, it is not one of the best\\, but if you skip Kanto Bai\\, this movie is entertaining and shines on some moments above what you expect.","true":true}
