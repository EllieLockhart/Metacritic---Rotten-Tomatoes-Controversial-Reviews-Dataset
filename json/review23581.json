Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this. Such a great addition to the traditions and fun of the series. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I wanted so many toys. I love the new characters\\, appreciated that it didn't take itself too seriously (except Kylo Ren\\, because of course he did)\\, and the worlds they built were gorgeous. Fantastic.","true":true}
