Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, really enjoyed this film. There are a bunch of moments in this film that provide such great depth to all the characters\\, that go in unexpected but logical directions. All the performances are fantastic especially from Daisy and Adam Driver. Mark Hamill nails Luke once again. The cinematography is absolutely stunning with some absolutely jaw dropping moments. I think fan reviews are divisive because so many people have specific expectations and wanted questions from TFA answered a certain way. This movie takes the risk to answer them in a different way than expected and give the future of this trilogy a less predictable future. To me that's what makes it so great\\, and not just a reproduction of the original trilogy. All that being said\\, I have one MAJOR complaint. This film is messy. The great scenes are too quickly chopped up and distracted by a subplot that is 100% unnecessary. If they trimmed that out\\, this film would most definitely be much better and more in the leagues of Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
