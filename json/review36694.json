Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is terrible. Plot makes no sense\\, all the characters do is pointless and  characters do what they do BECAUSE REASONS without any incentive to act like that. For non-fans the movie is a dumb flashy nonsense filled CGI fest\\, for fans it is just betrayal of everything they liked SW for.","true":true}
