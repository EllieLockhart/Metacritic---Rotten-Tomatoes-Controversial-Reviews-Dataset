Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly a disappointment. Sad to see Star Wars ruined like this. Disney has replaced great characters with pointless ones. Rey is already the best at everything so what are the stakes? No risks were taken. All shocking moments are undone moments later without consequence. Just poorly done overall. Instead of bringing all fans of the franchise together\\, Johnson decided to abandon the true fans for the sake of today\u2019s political talking points. Nothing is wrong with diversity. But diversity does not guarantee quality. This movie is proud to add diverse characters but then makes them pointless to the plot. I\u2019m told that fans who didn\u2019t like this are the problem. Fans wanted to like this movie more than anything. It just sucks.","true":true}
