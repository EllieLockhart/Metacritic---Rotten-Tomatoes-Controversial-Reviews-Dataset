{"101487":108079,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad movie\\, bad star wars movie... this movie grabbed the idiot ball and held on. Sorry this is going to be hate filled.\\n\\nOk so now we are confirmed that the Republic fell like a rotting house when the door was kicked in.\\n\\nThe Poe and Hux dialogue while funny doesn't belong in the movie unless your creating a Saturday morning cartoon. Also do dreadnoughts not have shields\\, and why would you have bombers that physically need to drop something... in Space!!! Why not torpedo bombers like Y-Wings or B-Wings. Also why are the rest of the Star Destroyers just sitting their jacking off. Seriously that was the most anti-climatic space battle ever. Seriously I cannot get over how stupid the bombers were\\, seriously who would ever design something like that for SPACE combat.\\n\\nMoving from the opening stupidity we know the First Order is weeks away from conquering every important system in the galaxy\\, but was afraid of a Fleet orbiting what... 5 systems? How big is the Order supposed to be to be worried about that and yet be able to steam roll the galaxy? Seriously does no-one have a planetary defense force\\, was the whole of the Republic fleet sitting above those Five-ish Planets. How the hell would you even police a galaxy let alone defend it with so small a force. Hell one of the reasons the Separatist crisis emerged was because the Old Republic could't police the old Republic and enforce its laws. In the OT it made sense to see small concentrations of ships. The Rebellion was a tiny group fighting against a massive empire holding down the galaxy. As for the Empire\\, one they were holding down the galaxy and \\,two\\, its a big place the rebellion could be anywhere. The only time we needed to see fleets was at Endor where the Rebels brought their entire fleet\\, which was still relatively small\\, and the Imperial Fleet\\, again relatively small\\, present was one that could be moved without anyone noticing.\\n\\nOk\\, for the flight from the Resistance base... really they're running out of gas? I realize I let my car run until the light comes on before I refuel it\\, but that's a really bad idea for a military or quasi military organization. Or are they suggesting they had no fuel reserves because that's like a big thing. I mean this movie takes place moments have Force Awakens so its not like the burnt it up fighting and they couldn't have used it up fleeing. Hell we've seen ships fly across the galaxy without refueling\\, Vader's fleet crusided around the Rim without a replenishment ship... unless the Executor carried fuel for her little sisters\\, but that's never come up before. So apparently they were sitting around on \\\"E\\\" because they're... dumb.\\n\\nDo they still use Hypermatter as fuel btw because doesn't that shit last like forever?\\n\\nSo them running from the First Order fleet this started off good... apart from the forgetting to fuel the ships... the attack when it first emerged was cool\\, though again the Star Destroyers sitting around and jacking off was dumb. The fighter combat was cool though why couldn't we have had another\\, maybe good\\, space battle? Snoke's ship was interesting but from everything we've heard its a factory ship not a combat ship. Though I'll give them props for at least giving it a sizable escort. Also don't Star Destroyer have like a hundred guns\\, why do we only ever see like one or two shots?\\n\\nWhen they blew up the bridge I was super impressed... that would have been a good death for Princess Leia and really you could have given the rest of her lines to the Vice Admiral whoever\\, but then they blew it. I mean really\\, Leia can survive being spaced... we've never had any indication that she's had force raising let alone enough to SURVIVE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE and then pull herself back into the ship however minutes later. Also now we know you have shields while the hell weren't they on before the fighters came... seriously do shields only matter when its relevant to the plot?\\n\\nAlso Ackbar died... I did realize it was even him until Poe said something... kinda a demotion there admiral went from the Admiral of the entire rebel fleet to... six ships?\\n\\nCasino planet is... meh though it does bring up a rather stupid plot hole. So the rich people are arms dealers or mostly arms dealers so apparently they're are no rich shipping magnates\\, actors\\, sports players\\, whatever\\, but OK I assume she was generalizing. Selling guns\\, however\\, to a war machine capable of overrunning the galaxy in weeks... really? I mean if would understandable if this was a small terrorist like group\\, but a war machine of this size? Even if she was talking about the Arms Industry I still don't buy it. I mean if that's the case a galaxy-conquering war machine was built without anyone knowing it and how they hell did the First Order pay for it? No one got sucpsions when someone was doing R&D for new Star Destroyers or TIE fighters? Seriously they couldn't have gone with secret shipyards in the Unknown Regions built by the Empire prior to its fall?\\n\\nThe fall of the Jedi Temple... I kinda like the idea of Luke being so afraid of releasing another Darth Vader that he'd consider drastic actions only to decide against it and for Ren to misunderstand. Its kinda of a cliche\\, but hey its a reason why he's so broken. But again really\\, Kylo Ren thought he killed Luke... shouldn't there have been a massive galaxy shaking disturbance if Luke Skywalker\\, Jedi Grand Master died. Did he not check physically or use the Force to check that's seems lazy\\, especially if you believe the guy wants to kill you. Also where did he meet Snoke? He's not a guy that can really blend in.\\n\\nLuke's \\\"let the Jedi End\\\" was weak. I mean really as long as they're are Sith or other Dark Side equivalents they're has to be someone to fight. Luke's entire attitude struck me as moral cowardice. I realize he was a broken man\\, but still saying 'let the galaxy burn' is bad. The only way to really win and end the Dark-light squabble is to take Kreia's route and murder the Force itself... though the consequences might be... dire. Also the Force now is trippy and Yoda came back to tell Luke Rey is awesome\\, not when he ran away\\, not when he abandoned the Galaxy to the Dark Side\\, not to suck it up and go fight the good fight\\, but to tell Luke how awesome Rey is. Whatever happen to show don't tell.\\n\\nNow to the female Vice-Admiral who apparently decided to wear formal wear while a member of the Resistance and a Second Galactic Civil War is starting. Did you not have time to change and look professional? Were you at all ball or cocktail party... or with dinosaurs? How many Admirals are in this six-ish ship fleet anyway? Also the disrespect she gives Poe\\, who at this point is most likely the senior pilot officer and the defacto Wing Commander\\, is astounding. Yes he disobeyed orders\\, but seriously praise in public\\, criticize in private... where the hell did she get her admiral's bars? We later learn this was because they (writers) were setting up the big reveal of a planet that's apparently not on any maps and apparently their sensors can't detect? Even then all she would of had to do is tell Poe\\, one of her most senior officers\\, this and it would have ended the issue. Instead she tells him to have hope... hope is not a plan lady\\, hope is wishful thinking. Hell she could have said \\\"trust me there is a plan\\\" instead of giving off the vibe that they're was none but no have hope because hope is more powerful then star destroyers.\\n\\nRehash of RotJ throne room scene.\\n\\nGod that was cringy... like bad fan fiction levels levels of cringy. Most of the Rey\/Kylo stuff is OK and even good but Snoke is just... the Emperor but not the Emperor. Also creating a Force bond across lightyears... and fucking with Ren's emotions to deceive Rey\\, ok\\, but then how can you then not realize that Ren is going to betray you. Hell you can only kick the dog so often and to make it worse couldn't it have been more telegraphed for the audience. The fight with the Red\\, totally not Imperial\\, Guard was ok\\, but I think both Rey and Rentend to forget they have Force powers well they'd really be useful. To give them credit I was ecstatic that Kylo Ren wasn't redeemed\\, that would have been too much. Kinda disappointed Rey didn't join him\\, not that I expected her too. Also side note I kinda want them to screw now\\, is that weird. I think they have odd but good chemistry.\\n\\nAlso Snoke is dead... all that build up\\, all that mystery for what totally not surprising surprise and funny face joke?\\n\\nThe destruction of the Supremacy was a cool shot\\, but kinda dumb. I mean if its that easily why not rig up remote control ships and just jump them into others. You created another plot hole that didn't a have to be there. Also I don't think that's how hyperspace works. You are in a different \\\"dimension\\\" or something... I mean you have to watch out for planets and other celestial bodies because they cast mass shadows. Also the MonCal ship waited a long time before turning while her shuttles got shot up. I thought she was going to turn and engage which would have been cool-ish and a little more dramatic... also Phasma died... ok why did we need her back?\\n\\nThe crystal planet... seriously guys that was a fucking horrible plan if they even had one. I mean there are what like 100ish members left and they threw away how many? Also what the hell were they flying... salt surfing skimmers that can kinda maybe fly when needed. If they can fly why didn't a few fly up to fight the TIEs? Christ that was stupid and also why did the Asian lady stop Fynn from where I was sitting it probably would have worked and prevented the breach... wasn't that the point? What did all the redshirts die for then? If I want to watch the Battle of Hoth I can watch Empire\\n\\nAstral\/Force projection over lightyears? I mean it is Luke Skywalker and he is on a Force nexus so... Ok. The fight was Ok too though I wonder what made Kylo Ren think he could take Luke Skywalker. You can't beat the lady who STILL hasn't had a minute of actual light-saber or a real Force training session and you think you can beat the guy who beat Darth Vader? I mean this is Luke fucking Skywalker\\n\\nLuke's death was meh. I mean he allowed the Resistance to escape so... yeah\\, but come on that's how he dies\\, a heart attack or something from strain?\\n\\nSo at the end of the movie... where back at episode III ending. Evil Empire controls the galaxy\\, how I have no idea\\, and new plucky band of rebels is forming to fight the First Order. God\\, people is this what we waited for... a worse ripoff of the OT\\, at least the prequels did something new\\, they expanded the universe and told an original story. Worse even this invalidates everything the original Rebellion fought for. After less that thirty years the Republic they struggled and bled and died to restore fell apart at the first whiff of trouble. If's that's not a betrayal... \\n\\nI wanted to like this movie... I wanted to like the Force Awakens but I can't... its\\, it's\\, its... bad.\\n\\nThe way I look at it the prequels were a failing of execution not of story. The story was largely there\\, but how they brought it to life was flawed. If you look beyond bad dialogue and poor acting the Prequels are one of the greatest tragedies in fiction. Beyond the Tragedy of Darth Vader it was the fall of the Old Republic\\, the Republic that has stood for ten thousand years\\, as a beacon of light in the darkness\\, of civilization and the ideal that all the species of the galaxy can come and work together as equals. Is it perfect? No. No system or government is\\, but it was something truly grand. In the end the Republic was brought low not through barbarian invasions or outside threats but by the weakness of those who should have strengthen it. By the failings and the corruption of the organs of government to the blindness of its greatest guardians to perhaps worst of all to the apathy of the common people who allowed democracy to die. The story and the potential greatness is there behind the flaws; which is something I thought the existing EU now legends allowed to come to the fore.\\n\\nThe new trilogy\\, or at least the first two movies\\, are not good stories.","true":true}
