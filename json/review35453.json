Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi did not dissapoint. It stayed true to Star Wars roots and also expanded and evolved. It makes way for the future of the galaxy & the force. It does make you long for more Carrie Fisher. She will be missed greatly in the next film.","true":true}
