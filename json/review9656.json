Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie. Not a very good Star Wars movie.  This movie seems to suffer from the same problems all movies today do. Lots of cgi and no meaty story. \\nGeorge Lucas should be ashamed of what has become of this franchise. Lots of holes and they will not be filled in. Sigh...but at least it will make a lot money","true":true}
