Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't care how much these so called \\\"Critics\\\" are getting paid to say this is a good movie. This is the WORST Star Wars movie ever! Bar None. Littered with plot holes and bad writing the whole way. If your looking for a Star Wars parody or how to ruin a franchise and all its deep lore in one movie let me introduce you to \\n\\nStar Wars THE LAST JEDI.\\n\\nThank you ladies and gentlemen *Mic Drop","true":true}
