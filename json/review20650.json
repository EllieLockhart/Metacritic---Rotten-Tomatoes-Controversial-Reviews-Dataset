Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen that some people are upset with change.  I think it was refreshing to see a changeup from what a lot of people expected.  I think The Last Jedi honorably closed the book on the past and opened up fresh possibilities for the future.","true":true}
