Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How in the LIVING HELL did any professional film critic rate this movie so high?  There is not way that's an honest critical reaction to this film.  Seeing such a glaringly dishonest critic score makes me think the audience score must\\, in reality\\, be far worse than is being shown here.\\n\\nNevertheless\\, MY score is as low as can be.  Despite the visuals that some people commend I see not redeeming qualities whatsoever in this film.  If you have not yet seen it\\, don't waste your time.  \\n\\nI've been a dedicated Star Wars fan my whole life. The first film I saw in theatres was Empire Strikes back. I've seen every single release on the big screen\\, including the special editions\\, multiple times - with the exception of The Last Jedi which I saw only once\\, and Solo which I didn't see at all. For those rare people who haven't yet seen or experienced Star Wars\\, do yourselves a favour and watch the original trilogy. It doesn't really matter which edition you watch\\, but personally I prefer the original formats. Each of the three were spectacular in their own right\\, and Empire Strikes back is considered by some to be one of the greatest films ever made. Not everyone would agree with me\\, but many would\\, that the Last Jedi is both the weakest of all 8 of the saga films (Episode 9 has not yet been released) and that it also does the most damage to both the lore of the Star Wars universe and to the most important legacy character. Many people who saw this film wish they had not. I am one of them.\\n\\nAs for direct criticisms of the actual film\\, there is no shortage of that to be found anywhere. I am in agreement with what the vast majority of those critiques assert: that the script is poorly written\\, the characters are weak and their actions make no sense\\, and that it seems to be the product of someone who either totally misunderstands the mythology of Star Wars or who purposefully intended to usurp the lore and legacy of the original trilogy. Many longtime fans consider this film to be the worst of all the Star Wars cinematic properties and I am one of them.","true":true}
