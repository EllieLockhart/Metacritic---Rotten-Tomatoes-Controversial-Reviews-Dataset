Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They really cared to make a movie that was true to the original trilogy. Jedis aren't some godly creatures like the shitty prequel jedis\\, they are emotional knights with constant inner conflict trying to balance the light and dark. And in the end this movie is\\, like the original trilogy\\, an space adventure movie\\, not much more. I'm glad they ignored the shitty and bloated expanded universe and just made an entertaining well crafted film. Well done Rian Johnson!","true":true}
