Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This would have been an excellent movie if ... it wasn't so bloated ... it knew how to end ... if it didn't completely betray original characters and misunderstand their moral core ... it didn't treat the Force like it was some sort of cheesy magic show ... if it didn't tell EXACTLY the same story as A New Hope. Other than that\\, it kinda stunk.","true":true}
