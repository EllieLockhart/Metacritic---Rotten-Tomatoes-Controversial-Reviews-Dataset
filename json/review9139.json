Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun flick with good story progression and interesting character development. Many nods to ESB and ROJ but not a retelling of a story we've already seen. If you liked any of the Star Wars movies\\, you should like this one.  If you love the comics and books outside of the movies and expect this movie to pay homage to that other fiction\\, you will be disappointed.\\nGreat movie that will hold up.","true":true}
