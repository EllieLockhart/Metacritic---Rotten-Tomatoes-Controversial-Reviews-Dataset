Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved rogue on and the force awakens. After the force awakens I was super excited to see luke again\\, see kylo ren train to become an badass with lord\\, find out who snoke really is\\, and find out who Rey\u2019s parents are. But I was shocked after the last Jedi to see that everything I was excited for was ruined. They ruined Luke\u2019s character\\, wasted the huge opportunity that was snoke\\, and ruined the idea of Rey\u2019s parents. The only thing I\u2019m still optimistic about is kylo ten. I really don\u2019t know where they are going to take episode 9 but unlike most of the Star Wars fans I will give it a chance. And if it is good then I will acknowledge that it is good. But as for this one it was a dumpster fire.","true":true}
