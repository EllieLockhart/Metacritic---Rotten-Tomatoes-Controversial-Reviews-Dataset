Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did I just see?! I'm shocked by the high critic score. This movie ead on arrival and I can't put into words how disappointed  I was. I've read about twists and turns\\, innovation\\, surprises. This movie had none. It's a mishmash of its predecessors and not in a good way. Even the better scenes are missing soul. The script is lazy. The escapes are nonsensical. And our beloved characters from the originals are all wrong.","true":true}
