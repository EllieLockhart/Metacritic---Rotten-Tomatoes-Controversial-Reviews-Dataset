{"101487":138009,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that would make me want to walk out of the theater. I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that I never wanted to watch again. I never thought one Star Wars movie could taint the entire series\\, possibly beyond repair - but someone they managed to do all those things.\\n\\nI have watched the original trilogy easily 50 times. I grew up in awe at the universe that George Lucas created\\, in awe of the amazing way Star Wars balanced incredible creativity and imagination with down to earth\\, amazing characters. The balance of being very futuristic\\, but almost in a way so nuanced and relatable that it seemed like it could actually be real.\\n\\nEnter The Last Jedi - completely took all relatability and threw it out the window. This movie completely started rewriting the Star Wars universe. The Force is apparently much different than the other 8 movies showed us. Characters apparently use 10 times the amount of sarcasm and humor that they did in the other 8 movies. The physics of space are different than the other 8 movies.\\n\\nI physically cringed\/rolled my eyes multiple times during the movie. They took the beauty\\, the depth\\, the amazingness of the Star Wars saga and made it a cheap\\, made-for-merchandise\\, gimmicky superhero movie a la Transformers or Avengers. It screamed \\\"WE MADE THIS SO WE CAN MAKE LOTS OF MONEY\\\" not \\\"WE MADE THIS BECAUSE WE FREAKING LOVE STAR WARS\\\". I cannot believe this movie is supposed to sit next to the original trilogy on the shelf.\\n\\nThere were so many moments I thought there might\\, just might\\, be a redeemable storyline and every time it was a let down. Poe going rogue to save the day - nope\\, just kidding. Finn giving his life to save everything - nope\\, replaced by the cheesiest line I've ever heard. Luke following Obi-Wan's example and giving himself up - nope\\, he was Force appearing somewhere (which no Jedi master has ever been able to do before) and died anyways.....WHAT?!!?!\\n\\nNot to mention\\, the agendas and cheesy messages that were so obviously pushed throughout the film - \\\"You can do anything you want\\, no matter where you come from\\\" \\\"It's not about fighting against what you hate\\, its about fighting for what you love\\\" Save the animals. Be a vegetarian. I could keep going. There is nothing wrong with these messages\\, its just that they were forced into a STAR WARS MOVIE! Go put that in your low-budget animated shit for kids\\, Disney. Thank you for forever ruining this series\\, idiots. Thank you for literally destroying a piece of my childhood. I just can't believe this movie was released. I might need freaking therapy to get over it (ok\\, a little over the top). Our only hope is that JJ Abrams that somehow pull this train back onto the tracks. But its a long journey back to the tracks.","true":true}
