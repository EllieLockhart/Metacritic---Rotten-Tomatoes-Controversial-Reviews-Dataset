Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was actually very disappointed with this movie. I for myself have no issue with Rian Johnson (director) trying to be unpredictable\\, and I also believe that you can make any movie premise work if you have the necessary skill to pull it off. \\nThis is simply not the case. The timing is very sloppy\\, filled with plot-holes that could have been easily avoided\\, and there's a lacking depth in character development that would have made it possible to empathize with the situations presented. The movie almost feels like a teenager's attempt to leave a mark in a franchise that's bigger than themselves. Such a waste of potential.","true":true}
