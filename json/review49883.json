Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can tell by the critics reviews that Disney paid them off. This movie does nothing to tell you anything about WTH is going on!! The film makes no sense what so ever!! The casino planet\\, WTH is that for? It's like the script was wrote by a little kid!! I could go on and on like millions upon millions of other fans have done but I don't feel like writing all day. Just take the real fans word on this one\\, it truly does suck!!","true":true}
