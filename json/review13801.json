Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found the pace of the film to be offputting\\, no luxurious shots or dialogues\\, instead with all of the tertiary (read: unnecessary) characters supported with screen time\\, the stuff that should have commanded the most screen time was instead clipped\\, to its detriment.\\n\\nAs a viewer\\, I felt that the 'ask' was too much\\, the screenwriters answered no questions I had about the mysteries developed in The Force awakens and in general nothing was solved for me.\\n\\nI won't view the film again and find myself skeptical of the new Star Wars vision\\, under Disney.","true":true}
