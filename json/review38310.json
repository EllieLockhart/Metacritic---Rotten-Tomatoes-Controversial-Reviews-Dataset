Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst film in the series by far. The plot is littered with holes and the subplots are frustratingly bad. The films treatment of its most popular characters is pathetic and the new characters introduced were forgettable. The only decent part of the film was the visuals of the Supremacy's destruction.","true":true}
