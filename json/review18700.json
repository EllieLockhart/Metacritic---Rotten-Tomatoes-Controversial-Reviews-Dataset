Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's 10 times the movie SW:FA was and comes in right after SW:NH\\, SW:ESB and Rogue One.  Don't pay attention to the nerdy fan boys who worship Luke.  At least he's a hero in this one\\, unlike poor Han.","true":true}
