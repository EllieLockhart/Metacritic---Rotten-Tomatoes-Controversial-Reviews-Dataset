Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to post my review. Everyone is right - they DESTORYED Luke's character in the most humiliating way possible. That move alone will alienate most of the long time series fans. I don't think Disney cares - their intent is to make a new marketing power house and they will no doubt succeed with younger viewers who don't have experience with the series and know it for what it is. But Disney will also lose the support of most of the original fan base\\, so I predict that Star Wars will eventually fade away as a cultural icon. You see\\, you cannot force feed morality in movies if it doesn't align with people's expectations by 'borrowing' street cred from an existing piece of culture. Trying to rewrite history this way doesn't work\\, and will likely be rejected by many. It is a shame they have neutered (literally) Lucas' universe in the way they have done. They should have retired the series and just a new\\, different universe with different characters - they wouldn't have pissed off as many original fans as they are doing with this movie. Some will call this edgy - but I call it soulless\\, politically correct\\, poorly revisionist\\, and devoid of human spirit. It will make money\\, but money is never the measure of cultural longevity. Tons of movies make money and are largely irrelevant and forgotten years later. This will be one of those movies. \\n\\n**RIP STAR WARS**","true":true}
