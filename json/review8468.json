Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally broke down and watched this travesty.. disliked EVERYTHING about this film from butchering original characters to infusing SJW themes and ideals to watering down the specialness of the powers that separated jedis from being something years of dedication and discipline required to just being feelings and hope.. and come on princess lies showing not a single sign of force ability her ENTIRE life can just suddenly force push herself through space and survive the vacuum and coldness of space because of feelings?? Smh.. good job liberal hollyweird you have killed a great franchise","true":true}
