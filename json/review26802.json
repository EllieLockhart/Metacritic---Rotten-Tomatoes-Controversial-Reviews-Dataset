Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One and half stars is generous. Although I would like to blame Disney\\, the director\\, and perhaps Luke for accepting his role after being angry with the direction this episode was going in\\, I cannot help but think this movie is the byproduct of a much larger conspiracy - a generation bullied by the 80's Star Wars fans. \\n\\nIf only you would have confronted us about your resentment\\, we could have spared the galaxy of a horrific demise. If only we could have talked about your feelings\\, or prescribed medication for your sorrows. I am not even talking about a win-win situation here\\, the least we could have done would have been compromise. Another Jar Jar Binks\\, anything but this.\\n\\n(True) Star Wars fans have surrendered\\, this false advertised (independent) Star Was film has conquered the galaxy. When I have children they will never be allowed to view unbalanced examples of the force such as this. I gave this movie a review of 1  1\/2 stars because at least Disney stayed true to themselves by marketing cute animals for another Star Wars Christmas.","true":true}
