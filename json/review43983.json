Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Threw away large chunks of Force Awakens like it wasn't interested in the trilogy arc established by JJ. \\nThe stunning visuals and handful of breathtaking scenes were ruined by sloppy side quests\\, too much quippy and slapstick humour and jumping the shark moments.","true":true}
