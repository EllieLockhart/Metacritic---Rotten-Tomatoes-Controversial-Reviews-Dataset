Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan ever since I was blown away by Episode IV as a 10-year-old. While I didn't like how Episode VII looked like an updated version of Episode IV (and frankly\\, I didn't find the new lead character\\, Rey\\, that interesting)\\, I could still enjoy it. For Episode VIII I can't even say that; this movie isn't Star Wars\\, it's merely a sci-fi movie which they called Star Wars - the Star Wars feel simply isn't there. \\nI can't believe the director actually claims to be a Star Wars fan\\, after how he mutilated this movie. Neither the story nor the lead characters are interesting\\, except for Kylo Ren and Luke. And Speaking of Luke\\, what kind of end is that for one of our most beloved Star Wars characters!? \\nFor the first time ever I'm not excited about Star Wars. I'm no longer interested in watching Episode IX\\, nor the Han Solo movie - how on earth can they fix the damage they have done to this franchise now...","true":true}
