Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan who went into this movie without expectations except an immersion into the world of Star Wars\\, I was not disappointed. I did not experience the so called \u201cfiller\u201d material other reviewers are talking about. Rather\\, I experienced \u201cconnector\u201d material that both adds into and ties together the movie. It was a masterpiece of movie craftsmanship created by a true Star Wars fam who understands what has been left out of the previous movies that needed to be introduced. 5\/5 will see again.","true":true}
