Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is so lost from beginning to end some funny seance but it could have been better if you didn't have 10 characters to understand what there role really is and who they are only one light sabre fight scene really it's a waist of time and money I can't believe I'm gonna say this JUSTICE LEAGUE was more fun to watch","true":true}
