Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More of a parody of a Star Wars movie - or perhaps a comedic homage.\\n\\nThe constant\\, often cringe-worthy jokes made it impossible to get immersed in this story\\, let alone care about the people in it. To make things worse\\, every third scene or so is completely extraneous and there are about seven too many plot lines.\\n\\nSpeaking of extraneous crap\\, there are several characters and adorable creatures that seem to be there simply to check boxes\\, sell toys\\, or serve a single function in the story. Taken together\\, all these superfluous elements create a sense of directionless ambling. It briefly fades at the climax (which is really the only decent part of the movie)\\, only to return with a vengeance when the movie skips right past its obvious endpoint.\\n\\nI had hoped at least that we'd moved past the endless recreations and visual callbacks to scenes from the original trilogy\\, but apparently not. I found myself rolling my eyes constantly as half of the plot beats and memorable moments from Empire and Jedi were paraded out one after the other\\, as if they just made a big list.\\n\\nIn terms of Star Wars\\, this movie was frankly insulting. I felt that TFA and R1 at least attempted to reproduce the feel and spirit of the original trilogy - but just failed miserably. TLJ seemed to think the whole endeavor was a joke. And I know it's supposed to be a movie for kids\\, but if that's the case\\, why all the callbacks to movies they haven't seen and don't care about? The marketing strategies have enveloped the whole movie at this point\\, and it's painful to watch.","true":true}
