Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen the movie 3 times now\\, and I loved every second of it. The previous installment The Force Awakens was amazing\\, yet fans didn't like it because it was just a rehash of A New Hope. The Last Jedi is a great\\, independent film\\, that took all of our predictions and toss them out the window. Crazy things I haven't seen before. And honestly. It's my favorite star wars movie to date. Star Wars fans will always hate star wars. Regardless of how good it is. GO see it\\, If you love it see it again\\, if you hate it\\, you will see it again\\, its star wars man","true":true}
