Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really wanted to like this movie. Really. I\u2019ve seen it twice now\\, and I disliked the parts I wasn\u2019t happy with even more\\, and liked the few well filmed scenes\\, more. Gave this 3 stars only for the effects and a certain lightsaber fight scene\\, plot was barely 2 stars. Disney has made this film childish (same kind of nonsense like in Guardians 2)\\, forced characters that didn\u2019t add any true benefit to the story\\, committed so many movie sins that they only got away with because it\u2019s Star Wars\\, and made all the characters seem like shells. Disney owning everything\\, sadly\\, seems to be killing true creativity\\, and making them a ton of money. Again\\, for a mindless movie experience\\, it\u2019s pretty on the surface\\, but it doesn\u2019t go much beyond that. ","true":true}
