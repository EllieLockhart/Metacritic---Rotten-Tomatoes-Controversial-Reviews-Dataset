Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is an unfocussed\\, uninteresting\\, and largely unfunny mess. Pair that with Rian Johnson's disregard of the franchises established rules and characters\\, as well as his complete abandonment of the storylines set up by J.J Abrams\\, and it becomes very hard to see any redeeming qualities in this movie. All together\\, it appears that in his attempts to defy audience expectations and create a story that is original and unpredictable\\, Johnson has not only stripped TLJ of an interesting story\\, but all the episodes to come due to its very permanent and influential decisions which will leave audience members desperately trying to find a reason not to hate this movie.","true":true}
