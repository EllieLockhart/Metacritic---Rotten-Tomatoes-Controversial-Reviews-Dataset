Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a serious let down. Say what you will about the prequels but atleast they didn't copy the originals and they had action. The legendary Luke Skywalker's last movie and we don't get a single lightsaber battle of him? Seriously?","true":true}
