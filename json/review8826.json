Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, The Last Jedi fell short on so many levels. It lacked a certain soul that the franchise had managed to carry with it for over forty years. As a science fiction film\\, it was enjoyable. As a Star Wars film\\, it was disappointing. Episode VIII felt like a derailment. There was an emotional buildup coming from Episode VII that fizzled out quickly here. I loved The Force Awakens and was excited to see these new characters develop. Unfortunately\\, they fall flat in TLJ. The force is not with this one.","true":true}
