Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am giving this movie no stars\\, it is an absolute ABOMINATION. There is nothing good about this film\\, not the story\\, the acting\\, the special effects\\, editing\\, directing\\, ZERO. It is not because I wanted to see the same ole same ole\\, I wanted something original. This\\, was just pure GARBAGE. It wasn\u2019t just a bad Star Wars movie\\, it was a HORRENDOUS MOVIE PERIOD!!","true":true}
