Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"these reviews were bought. there is no chance that any critic would rate the last Jedi 90%. I was a die hard star wars fan but\\, the last Jedi ruined it.\\n\\nthis movie tries to surround the theme of equality but does it in a ineffective way. in every character in the film has something brought from society like Poe and Finn are gay and admiral Holdo is a feminist. not to mention the promotion of multiculturalism and veganism. these aspects of society ruin the virtues of the star wars saga.\\n\\nIf you have not seen this movie\\, DON'T WATCH IT\\n\\n\\nalso\\, the plot wasn't thought out. Rian Johnson probobally thought- \\\"hmm maybe we should kill this person.\\\" and then a few moments later... \\\"nope we need to make him a hologram and we need to make her fly back from space like superman\\\".","true":true}
