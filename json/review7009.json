Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars Ever... There are themes about gender and race as well as political overtones that simply do not and have never belonged in a Galaxy Far Far Away... The shots are good and the score but that's all that is good in this travesty of film ...The plot is based on built conveniences\\, its got more holes than swiss cheese and simply is poorly and lazily written...the characters betray and contradict much of what we know about the force and the star wars universe... its particularly disgraceful what they did with Luke's character\\, making him out to have done things that his character would never have done ...there is entirely too much humor ruining pivotal moments and making a joke of Star Wars in general... It gets less than one star and that is being generous... the director\\, writers and producers could not have made a worse movie...","true":true}
