The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is a sad day considering I loved The Last of Us so much. A genuinely amazing story\\, with fantastic gameplay\\, interesting characters\\, and a terrifying setting that you must constantly fight through. The final decision Joel had to make was powerful and impactful. This sequel is not that.\r\rIf I were rating this as a stand alone game completely disregarding any premise of story prior\\, and not experiencing the gameplay of The Last of Us\\, it would probably be a solid 5 or 6 out of 10. The problem is that this story feels like it completely derails the story the first game had. When we finished the first game we saved Ellie\\, and lied to her about the fireflies. This could have been a great way to build up the second game. We could have had the two search for a cure themselves\\, and if the writers wanted Joel to die it could have come at the end of the game or near the end of the game. Ellie could have found out that Joel had lied about the fireflies\\, Abby could have been in a group of fireflies that heard about Ellie\\, and hunted Joel down. Ellie and Joel have a big fight\\, and they split up only for Ellie to hear gunfire\\, and find Joel dying at the hands of Abby. Then\\, Ellie has to fight and come to terms with the fact that she cared deeply for Joel\\, but his lying and protection of herself jeopardizes the fate of the world. Something along those lines could have been fantastic and very well executed. We could have played the parts as Abby prior to this to build up her character and motivations for doing what she does. It could have been an amazing sequel to an already amazing game.\r\rWe didn't get that though. We got a sloppy\\, poorly executed story. Joel dies very\\, very early on. We have no build up for this Abby character\\, and then are expected to play as her? That is insanity. Why in gods name would I want to play as a character who just killed an incredibly beloved character? This could have been circumvented so easily if the game had you play as Abby in the beginning and turn her into a character we cared about as well\\, but it doesn't. Instead we get a horrible impression of her immediately\\, have to suffer through playing as her\\, which then feels like a chore because we already dislike her\\, and then we are expected to believe Ellie just forgives her in the end. It's sloppy. It's not a good story. It doesn't captivate me. It made me frustrated to even play the game.\r\rNow I'm very critical of stories in games\\, because it's the main reason I'm playing them. The gameplay was still good\\, but it felt very lazy because it was like a copy and paste of the first game's gameplay. While it's not a bad thing considering I already spending 50+ hours on the last of us\\, spending more time doing the exact same stuff starts to feel tedious and boring. I wish they did more to change up or add some new interesting mechanics to spice it up a bit. It really could have turned this review into at least a 5\/10 if the gameplay was able to bring more enjoyment to the game itself. The graphics and sound design were beautiful\\, it's just too bad that graphics and sound design don't mean anything if your game isn't up to snuff.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
