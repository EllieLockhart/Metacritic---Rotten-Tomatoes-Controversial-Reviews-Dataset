Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst Star Wars since Attack of the Clones! what a sad waste after Force and Rogue One. No plot at all. Leia doing a Mary Poppins through space was awful when it could have been used to give her a glorious end considering Carrie Fisher's passing. Middle casino section was dreadful and had no purpose. Seemed to be a politically motivated movie about money made by countries selling military equipment\\, equal race opportunities and animal welfare which is not what Star Wars is about\\, its about getting away from whats going on in the world and using your imagination. Too many silly jokes\\, Luke milking an alien! Hammer was underused in these 2 movies\\, didn't technically weird a lightsaber in either which is ridiculous and just dying off like that with them keeping on Leia who didn't really offer much again was a poor decision. Could have done well killing Finn but chose to give us a baby kiss which was pointless\\, lots of pointers to Rey's backstory and Snoke's power but nothing offered on either character.\\nEven the prequels had a story of Emperor and Vader to get you excited\\, Empire to Jedi had you excited but this ended with no tease\\, no hanger it doesn't set up anything for Ep9. First Star Wars i have absolutely no interest in watching again it really should have been so much better.","true":true}
