Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this film and I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets. I especially liked the character development of Luke and how he isn't the hero and now sees that he was arrogant.","true":true}
