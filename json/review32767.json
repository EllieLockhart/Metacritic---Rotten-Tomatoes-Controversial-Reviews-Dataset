Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"StarWars: The Last Jedi was a disappointment. It spent the entire time running away from The First order. The only good scene was when there was an epic action filled fight with ray and kylo ren VS Supreme Lord Snokes personal soldiers.","true":true}
