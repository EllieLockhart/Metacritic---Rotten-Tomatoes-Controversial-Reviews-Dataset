Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst of the Star Wars movies\\, but hardly the best. The biggest issue for me was pacing. A large part of the movie was based around a 'space chase' but one where the ships were moving at the speed of a snail. All the while cutting between 3 different plot lines. (Possibly even 4 plot lines) While they were able to somewhat pull this off somewhat in Return of the Jedi\\, it come off as unnecessary and convoluted. There is a large plot line that actually ends up being pointless. While I understand what they were trying to accomplish\\, it ends up falling flat for me. Another issue is the comedy. While some of the jokes hit\\, many of them take away from the experience of the movie. Pivotal points in this movie are undercut with cheap jokes that just are unnecessary. It is possible that down the line I feel slightly better about this movie\\, but for now I remain disappointed.","true":true}
