Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe how butchered the Star Wars mythology is in this new film. The pacing of the film is terrible and the amount of exposition that the characters did made it even worse. The jokes are low effort and downright terrible. The main antagonist became your generic Disney cartoon villains that have no clear motivation whatsoever. \\n\\nThere were many things wrong with this film that I just feel so disconnected watching it. The visual is impressive but everything just falls apart. Sound and music are good but they brought nothing exciting or memorable like the previous Star Wars film.","true":true}
