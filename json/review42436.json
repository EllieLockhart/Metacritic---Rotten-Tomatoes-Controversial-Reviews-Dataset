Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disaster.  I've tried to like it but I just can't.  I can't even make it half way though now that it's on DVD. There is just so much wrong with it.  It's not the things that they've done  to the characters\\, but so much of the plot just doesn't make any sense.  Add to that the story has no depth.  I'm just hoping that solo will turn out to be a far better addition to the franchise.","true":true}
