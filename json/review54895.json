Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems to me\\, this movie is either loved it or hated it\\, nothing in between\\, seems to show this currently in the ratings at 58% I\u2019m a HUGE Star Wars fan since 1977 when New Hope came out. While this movie give you some nostalgia\\, it seems to me they are starting a New Star Wars with this movie\\, whereas The Force Awakens was all about nostalgia. This movie takes risks\\, and I appreciate it and unexpected twists. Was it perfect? No\\, what movie is? I think the intro of new characters are to help transition between the old and new and might be leading into the new trilogy of Star Wars. One thing I didn\u2019t like was the almost forced humor sometimes but it didn\u2019t bother me too much and I was able to overlook it. Visuals were amazing! Great story with several OH SHIT moments. GO SEE IT! ","true":true}
