Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honesty\\, I have been a Star Wars fan ALL MY LIFE and this shit is just embarrassing. I have never seen a movie (I probably have) that has been filled with so much disappointment. Disney is pumping out these movies way too quickly and not stopping for a moment to think\\, how much these movies are ruining Star Wars. This movie\\, had so much potential. Characters like\\, Snoke\\, had potential (at times)\\, but they just fuck it up\\, killing him off before you even get to see anything and i mean ANYTHING ABOUT HIM. Luke\\, what even is LUKE\\, he could see the good in Darth Vader in the originals\\, but cant see it in Kylo Ren\\, and tries to FUCKING KILL HIM\\, THE FUCKKKKK!!!!!! The only good thing in this movie is Kylo Ren\\, only good character (that's what the half star is for).","true":true}
