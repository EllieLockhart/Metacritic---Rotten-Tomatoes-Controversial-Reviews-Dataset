Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SW:TLJ is... a movie. An awfully long\\, needlessly complicated movie. Seems they had a great idea for a main character\\, had to build a movie around it and didn't know what to do. I love TFA and RO\\, but this one\\, thank heavens I didn't spend my hard-earned money going to a far away IMAX theater...","true":true}
