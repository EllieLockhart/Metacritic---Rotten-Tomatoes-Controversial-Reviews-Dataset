Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The whole movie is just a mess of plot holes and flat characters. Some review describe it as a 'sprawling adventure' but the only way it sprawls is that it's all over the place with no real story. Or at least\\, no story that makes sense. The characters exclusively make terrible decisions\\, and the plot is nonsensical. Worst star wars movie ever\\, so bad in fact that many people I've spoken to refuse to accept it as canon\\, no matter what Disney say. The only reason I have not rated 'macguffin wars: the Mary sue awakens' less\\, is because rotten tomatoes doesn't count scores of less than 1 star.","true":true}
