The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Spoiler alert... Great visual\\, great action\\, great CG and Characters design\\, but...\rIf the studio wants to keep sharing the same game title: The Last Of Us\\, they'd better concern more about how the players would react to how the game is turning in PART II.\rI don't mind if the story designed Joel's death in the game\\, but at least not at the first couple of hours of entering the story. It ruined the player's tie with the main character. We have all invested emontionlly into Joel throughout the first LastOfUs game. Framing Joel's death in the first 2 hours in PART II? That just ruined my mood for the rest of the game play. I have no enjoyment at all. I did not care how Ellie and Dina explore the city of Seattle at all. All the time they spent in the city were waste of time in my opinion. Yet\\, getting the revenge isn't what I care either. There is no close tie between the game characters and us - the true player behind the controller. The PART II has lost what made it popular in PART I.\rI appreciate the game developers who put their time and efforts in developing this game\\, but I believe they would be appreciated much much more if the story wasn't what it is right now. There are a lot gaps and holes in the way how the game tells its story. Constant memory flashback did not change the fact that as player I have no interest in going any further with the game.\rTo respect my money spent on this game\\, I at least want to finish the game once so I have played through the whole game before start writing my reviews and comments. I am giving the score of 5 for the whole game. But if scoring only the story telling and structure\\, I would give 3 instead.\rNext time\\, I won't trust any reviews came out prior to the release date. It appears all of those popular reviewers are afraid of putting negative reviews. There are definitely \\\"controllers\\\" around this. I don't like the false review\\, especially for the games that I loved.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
