{"101487":145835,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since the beginning\\, and I remember a long\\, long time ago when the thought of yearly Star Wars films sounded like an impossibly delightful future.  Now that we're here\\, it's quite the opposite.\\nThere is so much wrong with the newest installment that I will leave the gritty details to other reviewers.  What I will say is that the pacing\\, editing\\, comedy\\, and acting are all sub-par in the Last Jedi.  Disney is pushing diversity and animal rights with all the subtlety of a slap to the crotch.  Beloved characters from the original trilogy are discarded\\, ignored\\, of grossly misrepresented.  (I refuse to believe that this is what happened to the characters from the original films; I'll stick with the expanded universe stories instead\\, thank you very much).  Everything that happened in The Force Awakens is thrown out the window\\, and we aren't given much of a reason to come back for Episode 9\\, as most of the plot points for this trilogy have been wrapped up.\\nHowever\\, none of this really matters anyway.  The movie is a huge success and credits are being flown to Disneyland by the Sailbargeload.  I can only assume brand manager Kathleen Kennedy and her band of White Slavers are celebrating the opening weekend box office numbers with the Max Rebo Band as we speak.  It seems as if Disney has taken the Michael Bay attitude of \\\"let them hate; they're still going to see the movie.\\\"\\nSo\\, if you don't like the way that the Star Wars franchise is going\\, take a note from the Star Wars playbook and rebel.  Don't watch this movie or future installments.  Don't buy merchandise\\, don't give them any of your money.  Otherwise you're just encouraging them to continue producing garbage.  It's as simple as that.","true":true}
