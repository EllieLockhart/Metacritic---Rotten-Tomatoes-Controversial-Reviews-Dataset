Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching TFA I walked out with hopes and dreams of what they could do with this new saga. \\nWho are Rey's parents?\\nWho is this new guy snoke?\\nWhy did Luke stay on this island for so long?\\nLuckily for us\\, Ryan Johnson addresses each one of these questions in the most unexpected way!\\nWho are Rey's parents? Who gives a crap\\nWho is this new guy snoke? Nobody cares once he's dead \\nWhy did Luke sit on his island for 10 years? To milk nasty sea cows on screen","true":true}
