Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredibly nuanced and self-aware addition to the Star Wars franchise. I really enjoyed the little injections of humor and wit\\, as well as the phenomenal character development. The new additions to the cast were well fleshed out\\, without being shoehorned or taking away from the established cast. The relationships that were explored in this film were surprising\\, yet completely relatable. Definitely a film to be watch multiple times!","true":true}
