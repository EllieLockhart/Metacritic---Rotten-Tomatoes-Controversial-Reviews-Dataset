Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very key element to this story is the use of holograms\\, where characters not only use the force to communicate but they can actually see each other. This has never been an attribute of the force. So to introduce it now\\, 8 movies in\\, is simply not acceptable. The story took far too many liberties in adding elements that are central in telling the story without respecting the legacy that has been set. Also\\, far too many things are left unexplained. Who is Supreme Leader Snoke? How did he enter Kylo's life ? At best\\, the storytelling is sloppy. This movie isn't the franchise crusher that The Phantom Menace was but it definitely is a hiccup that will take some cleaning up in episode IX.","true":true}
