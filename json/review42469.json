Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment. The plot was completely inconsequential and had huge holes in it. There were too many characters doing too many unconnected things; it would have done better to focus the plot and actually thoroughly develop the main parts so it retained some continuity. As it was\\, it felt like they were combining good ideas from several separate sources\\, but therefore could not develop any of them fully which resulted in a confusing and disjointed story. There were way too many forced jokes and the dialogue was almost as corny as the prequels. I was rolling my eyes every 10 minutes it seemed. The only redeeming qualities were Kylo Ren's character development into a more complex villain and several cool action sequences. Outside of that it is a waste of 2 and a half hours.","true":true}
