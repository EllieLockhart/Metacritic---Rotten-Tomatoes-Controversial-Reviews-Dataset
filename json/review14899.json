Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I initially dismissed all the cries of \\\"terrible\\\" and angry YouTube rants as \\\"butthurt fanboys\\\".  I was wrong. It really is THAT bad!\\nI give one and a half for good visuals but story\\, character and everything thing that matters deserves zero stars. \\n\\nFrankly I'm amazed its scoring 49% with the audience. Judging from most verdicts I'm seeing here it should be more like 20%","true":true}
