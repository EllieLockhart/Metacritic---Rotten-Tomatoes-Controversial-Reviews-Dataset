Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. What an experience. After J.J. Abrams recreated the mold\\, reminding us why we fell in love with Star Wars in the first place\\, it was bold for Kathleen Kennedy to allow Rian Johnson to break the mold as wide open as he did and do something so new\\, unpredictable\\, and uncompromising. For a year filled with surprisingly bold entries into genre pictures from major studios (Logan\\, Blade Runner 2049\\, mother!\\, Get Out\\, etc.) you can count on Star Wars to deliver something that challenges the series\u2019 conventions\\, viewers\u2019 expectations\\, but handle with the best of grace. That being said\\, not all of The Last Jedi\u2019s swings are hits\\, and a few moments feel like they were one rewrite away from landing strong.","true":true}
