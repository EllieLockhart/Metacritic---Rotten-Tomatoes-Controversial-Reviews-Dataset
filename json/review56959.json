Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie of the Disney SW franchise\\, this lumbering\\, often tedious\\, mess suffered under bad acting\\, bad writing\\, and bad direction. Most of the film is inconsequential filler; only the scenes with Rey\\, Kylo and Luke meant anything and those were interspersed with an hour and a half of meaningless\\, rehashed storylines that added nothing to the film. I didn't like\\, nor care about\\, any of the new characters and resent the fact that they forced this love triangle into existence. Not to mention\\, what happened to Poe's promised gay reveal? Apparently\\, just smoke and mirrors to sell tickets. It's not as bad as the prequels but it's not great.","true":true}
