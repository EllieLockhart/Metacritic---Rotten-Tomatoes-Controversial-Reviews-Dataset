Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just wanted to make a comment to all of those who are already complaining.  Many of you are too young to remember\\, but many people felt the same after The Empire Strikes Back.  The movie ended with the hero not only losing a hand\\, but we found out the bad guy was his father.  The other hero is frozen and taken away by some other bad guys.  The good guys had gotten their butts handed to them and it ended on a pretty somber note.  You are claiming that the move ruined the franchise and what was sacred...  HELLO!  It isn't over yet!  There is still another Episode\\, how can you complain that its ruined when you haven't seen the whole thing yet?","true":true}
