Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead but if you haven't seen it yet\\, the movie itself spoils Star Wars so no big deal. I'm copying and pasting at this point but this was my take on it... And in truth the social\/ political stuff didn't phase me at all. My issues are solely that there are no rules anymore. And it's not just that the Force or BB-8 can do anything at all to magically fill all the bad writing. There are no rules even when it comes to keeping plot points or set ups\\, or character's values that were firmly established for 30+ years. (SPOILER: Luke surrenders in RTOJ to go to Darth Vader\\, the baddest baddie\\, because he felt he had good in him\\, was willing to potentially die to attempt to turn him to the light\\, and then in TLJ he sees darkness in Kylo and ignites his lightsaber to kill him in his sleep \\\"in base instinct\\\" while Kylo trusted him? Not even the same character. And let's forget about physics or anything that's been established at all. (More SPOILERS: All in a matter of minutes one person lies on a platform with an open door beneath them leading to open space and is fine\\, and then another gets sucked into the vacuum of space when the main deck is breached. Then we have Leia surviving in a vacuum with some wicked force powers that I'm sure a lot of old republic Jedi with years of training wish they'd known how to do... nobody needs training anymore\\, and while the scene visually was awesome\\, we have weaponized lightspeed now I guess\\, which penetrates shields and cuts gigantic threats in half. If that was always possible\\, then... why the pretense in every other movie when trying to take out some big thing.) That of course is less of an issue for me than how I felt about Luke losing everything that made him Luke which happens apparently before these movies even took place and for no reason. (Referencing his interaction with Ben pre-TFA\\, not how he's grumpy now) There were a few parts I liked and I tried to smile every time the kids looked at me and smiled but almost the entire movie my mouth was open. And the humor was... tragically trendy teenage bs. Also\\, now that everything that was set up in TFA is answered in the crappiest and quickest way possible or made to not matter anymore\\, I have no idea where they'll go with 9. This is just my opinion and I could go into detail on so much more..\\n\\nOne last thing\\, how many alien boobies does a movie need... And Maz's joke about being satisfied in every way by the hacker\\, and the long build up to the \\\"yo mamma\\\" joke at the beginning? That's not Star Wars. If you want that watch Guardians of the Galaxy. It's made to be that way. Star Wars was not. So were Star Wars fans spoiled before? Yes\\, and that's why the fan base is here. That was what we came for and that's why so many of the fan base disliked this one. I get bringing in new generations to generate new profits but spitting in the face of the long standing fan base was the wrong way to do it.","true":true}
