Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. The side-plot involving Finn and Rose Tico made the latter the present-day Jar Jar Binks equivalent. Every scene she was in was cringe-worthy. Not her fault probably but unwatchable nonetheless. And for a sci-fi film there was a notable lack of non-human diversity (few aliens among the Resistance). Rey proved to be a one-dimensional character although there were numerous opportunities to expand it and make her more interesting. Snoke is a mystery: How did he come to power? Is he a Sith\\, if so is he the reincarnated Darth Plagous? How did he come to encounter Kilo Ren? None of these were answered. So\\, so very disappointing...","true":true}
