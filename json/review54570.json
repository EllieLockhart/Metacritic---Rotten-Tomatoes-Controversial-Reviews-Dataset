Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm in the original Star Wars generation having seen every film in the theater going back to 1977.  Bought every toy as a kid\\, and joined the 501st legion as an adult.  I would say that while parts of the film are interesting the film didn't satisfy my appetite at the end nor did it make me hungry for the next installment. And I never had this experience before with Star Wars\\, including the prequels.  Most of the characters are bland or completely characterized and the story drags on in the middle to the point where all momentum was lost and was adrift at sea.  Star Wars movies are supposed to be fun\\, simple\\, and keep moving.  This film seemed to have an agenda on many fronts to the point of not being fun.  On the positive\\, the visuals were great and kudos to Adam Driver and especially Mark Hamill\\, who had to endure through his character's assassination while giving a brilliant performance.  J.J. has inherited a hole so deep it may not be possible to emerge from and for many fans they won't care if he succeeds.","true":true}
