Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s not that this is a bad movie\\, it\u2019s just a bad Star Wars movie. Too many jokes\\, long scenes that could of been trimmed\\, and some of the decisions made on characters both new and old made little sense. Seems like the stand alone movies may turn out to be the better Star Wars movies. ","true":true}
