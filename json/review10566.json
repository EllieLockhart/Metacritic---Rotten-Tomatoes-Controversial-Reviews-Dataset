Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals\\, epic Rey and Kyli team up. Luke and Leia treament were uninspiring and out of character. Blatant\\, self-righteous SJW propaganda cheapens the experience. Plot lines and story pacing were horrible and sloppy.","true":true}
