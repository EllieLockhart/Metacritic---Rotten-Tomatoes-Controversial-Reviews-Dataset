Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something just so off about the movie. On the surface it looks and sounds like Star Wars\\, but really goes downhill after a solid first act. \\nFeels like a rough draft of the original New Hope version back when it was called \\\"Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills.\\\"\\nPros: Kylo Ren's arc was intereting. Daisy Ridley does a solid job along with Oscar Isaac with what they were given. Force powers expanded\\, solid first act to the story.\\nCons: Too many plot devices & pointless actions. More than a few plot holes that go beyond space western suspension of disbelief. More depressing than fun when everything settles.","true":true}
