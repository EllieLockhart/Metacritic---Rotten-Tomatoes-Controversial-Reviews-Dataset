Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Awful. Appaling. Atrocious. Poorly written script with a complete disregard for source material that preceded it in a franchise with the richest lore in maybe all of cinema... and not just disrespectful to the originals and the prequels but the plot points created in The Force Awakens ! The characters are all lack luster and uninteresting\\, interesting characters were killed or turned into slap stick comedic reliefs (hux) and nothing made sense. The plot was insanely nonsensical. As someone who lived and breathed Star Wars I now have ZERO interest in any of the characters. I hated every second of this movie and RT poetically made me give this movie half a star... if i had to attribute that half star to something its for making me cherish the soap opera prequels and Jar Jar.","true":true}
