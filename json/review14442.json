Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to go for a 15 min walk after watching the last Jedi last night. Its a horrifically bad and extremely boring butchering of both JJ Abrams' new characters and George Lucas' original ones. For me its the worst Star Wars Film ever made\\, in no small part because it feels much more like a Marvel entry than a story from a galaxy far away. many of the sequences are impressive\\, and Johnson tries to introduce some genuinely interesting themes at points\\, but he doesn't manage to hold on to any of it. The last half hour of the film is as laughably bad as the recent independence day re boot.","true":true}
