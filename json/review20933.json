Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was genuinely excited and happy I got to see the movie on a 1am showing Thursday night\/Friday morning. And oh\\, what a disappointment. By far my least favorite SW movie. The plot was simply empty\\, no emotions\\, nothing was at stake\\, there was no goal or light at the end of the tunnel. I can't even describe how\\, the longer the movie went\\, the sadder and more disillusioned I became. I hope Episode IX can pick up the slack and return to the magic of what SW was\\, is\\, and could be. And please\\, no more Rian Johnson and his Porgs. What a waste of screen time and money that was.","true":true}
