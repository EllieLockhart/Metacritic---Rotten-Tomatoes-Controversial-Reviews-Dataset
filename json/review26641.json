Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok definitely not as bad as the majority is saying. Been a fan since the beginning...Spoilers: My beefs: 1. Who is snoke!? 2. No lightsaber duel!? I mean...thats like the best part of the show!!! 3. Nothing actually happened lol It moves the story forward and opens up the future of the story...which never ever ends. All in all there was some emotional moments I enjoyed\\, I liked how Luke was conflicted\\, and his downfall that lead to Ren was believable...Good action...and Star Wars flavor Oh yeah! I would of liked a showcase of Luke vs Snoke or something showing off his Jedi Mastery...though they sorta did it In a cheap hollow way...not sure how I feel about it UPDATE: after letting it marinate overnight I really had to drop my rating a bit another star. He writing and build up from Force awakens was totally set ablaze...the writing was BAD in this movie... 1. Snoke is nobody 2. Rey is nobody 3. Luke is a murderer\\, even though Luke saw a sliver of hope in Vader he was about ready to execute Ben 4. Hyperspace is now weaponized 5. Rules of gravity change over an over with no reason","true":true}
