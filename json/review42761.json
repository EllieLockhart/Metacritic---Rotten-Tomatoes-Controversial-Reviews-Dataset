Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie was horrible\\, the whole plot of The Force Awakens literally gets thrown out the window in this Movie. So many wasted opportunities and characters that were set up well in The Force Awakens\\, just a let down. The portrayal of Luke Skywalker was just insulting and just a slap in the face to us fans and also Mark Hamill.","true":true}
