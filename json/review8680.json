Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flashy special effects don't make up for a disappointing story filled with unnecessary characters and a lack of overall development.  The events of this movie could easily be boiled down to 30 minutes of worthwhile information. Overall it felt like a filler movie compared to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
