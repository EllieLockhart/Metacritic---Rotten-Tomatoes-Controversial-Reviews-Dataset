Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These are the four reasons that I disliked this movie:\\n1) the story line was difficult to understand\\n2) too much product placement for merchandising\\n3) too much comedy\\, like they didn't take the story seriously\\n4) a lot times the movie was slow and boring\\nThis is the worst Star Wars movie ever.  I liked Phantom Menace better than this one.","true":true}
