Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Several of the characters get a well deserved arc in the story. The rich nuances of the story dependent on concurrent action\\, which was executed very well. The character development for Rey as a full-fledged Jedi and Kylo as a full-fledged Sith are drenched in the lore of what constitutes those types of characters; Selfless vs. selfish. Darkness rising\\, and light to meet it. Luke's many mistakes since ROTJ are made up for by his last scene\\, where he returns as a Jedi Master\\, redeeming himself with one final grandstand. There are a few points in the film where there were jokes and puns that were forced. Some very subfocal loose ends served what their intended purpose was regarding Finn. There isn't much of a character arc for Leia\\, but there were two scenes in which her personal development has grown and illustrates her Skywalker heritage. Overall\\, the jokes and bad puns subtracted from the film. But the respect paid to the Hero's Journey as well as the solid respect of Star Wars lore leaves me wanting more and anxious for episode IX.","true":true}
