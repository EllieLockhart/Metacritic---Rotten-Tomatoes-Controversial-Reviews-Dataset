Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like movies with female protaganists...but with that said\\, when said movie has a political\/social justice message or agenda\\, sorry but that is just unappealing. The action scenes were entertaining for those who love great visual and audio effects but the story stank enough that the good doesn't go far enough to redeem its bad. Regardless of what anyone might say\\, Rey is totally a \\\"Mary Sue\\\". She would be a more interesting character if she didn't know almost everything about the force right off the bat and had to go through some sort of struggle and gain knowledge of the force through training and patience over the years.","true":true}
