Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge plot holes and missed opportunities on an epic story. Whoever wrote this movie needs to be fired. What Abram's left us with in the force awakens feels pushed aside by a toy marketing campaign and insignificant reveals. I really hope Abram's can salvage the plot that no longer feels that important.","true":true}
