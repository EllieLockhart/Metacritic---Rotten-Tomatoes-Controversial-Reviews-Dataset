Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it had a few parts that didnt fit with what i expected\\, it was overall a very well played out movie. it brings out the realistic humanity of Luke after his last failure\\, and gives him a death similar to his teacher\\, Obi Wan. Sacrificing himself to save the others so they can do more. He had up until that point cut his ties with the force\\, and now that sudden flow was too much for his body. he knew the consequences of this\\, but also knew that he had to do it to save the others. most people are just upset because he died\\, and because he did like those before him who failed\\, went into exile. thats not the luke they wanted\\, but its the luke that is real.","true":true}
