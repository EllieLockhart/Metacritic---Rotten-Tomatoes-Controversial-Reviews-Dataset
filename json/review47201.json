Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an embarrassment and cash grab for Disney. Leave your brain at the door and look at the bright colors. All Star Wars lore is irrelevant\\, huge plot holes\\, dropped subplots from Episode 7. Very disappointing I could go on but\\, its not worth your time to watch movie or even read my review. I miss the art of story telling by George Lucas.","true":true}
