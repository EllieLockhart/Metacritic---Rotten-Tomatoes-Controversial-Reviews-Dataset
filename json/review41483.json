Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a waste of money: both the money it took to make the film\\, and your money that you will spend to view it. The film not only perpetuates and exacerbates the failures from the previous movie.  Poor characters\\, atrocious plot\\,and a total disregard for the franchise as a whole. The movie visually looks very shiny\\, but very artificial--like the armor of the first order. Some of the actors try to give good performances\\, but their roles and plots lines stink. My advice is to wait to see if the Han Solo movie will be any better.","true":true}
