Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoiler Free) As a movie\\, I thought it was fine. Good visuals\\, amazing score\\, etc. However\\, it really didn't feel like a star wars movie. It felt out of place\\, like Johnson either hadn't seen another star wars movie or just didn't care. I feel like he had a completely different vision for the series than Abrams did and got started in ep VIII. The tone was off (from other sw movies)\\, it felt choppy\\, and I felt like there wasn't a real heart or core to the movie. Many of the characters seemed off or out of character. I also felt like there were too many things done\/said JUST for the sake of being funny\/for comic relief\\, which felt weird to me (like\\, this isn't a marvel movie!!). Many of the scenes and relationships hyped up in trailers\/promos fell flat. One of the major plot points was completely pointless\\, which was annoying considering how long the movie was. There were good scenes\\, but a lot of them felt overshadowed by the bad ones. Overall\\, especially considering how hyped up this movie was by critics\\, I was disappointed. (Hopefully Abrams can fix things in ep IX)","true":true}
