Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s not perfect and you can absolutely pick apart the odder plot choices\\, however this is without a doubt the most interesting movie in the entire series that has characters follow through with their terrible decisions. It also has the most novel ideas and takes the series in a fresh direction that (if you\u2019re willing to take the trip) has more to say than \u201conly certain people are allowed to be special Jedi\u201d.","true":true}
