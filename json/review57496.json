Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review contains spoilers.\\nThis episode has its moments. As a pure spectacle\\, I found it fine. ILM\\, as usual\\, did a terrific job. Battle scenes are indeed spectacular. Williams score\\, omnipresent\\, is effective while not very new. In 3D and on a big big screen\\, you will spend some good moments...\\n\\nIf...\\n\\nYou don't mind the story and treatment of the characters. To give the direction to a newbie in the Star Wars franchise\\, ok\\, fine. Lucas did it before on episode 5 and 6\\, even if he was never too far. To give direction AND writing responsibility to a total newbie by himself was risky indeed and never been done before. Lucas wrote the first 6 episodes and 7 was co wrote by an ex Lucas collaborator. But\\, as far as I know\\, Rian Johnson never worked on a Star Wars movie\\, not even as an assistant. He never wrote a book in the Star Wars universe. \\nSo why on earth did Kathleen Kennedy choose him to write The Last Jedi and take responsibility for the future of the franchise ? The problem is\\, on many occasions\\, Johnson did serious mistakes and made bad decisions. \\nI won't enter in full details\\, some other reviewers did before me. But for example... Snoke death. I could not believe how the most powerful man in the galaxy die so miserably. If he had slipped on a banana skin... that will make no difference. Not to mention we know nothing about him... and now he is dead. That won't help ! Among others\\, the casino scene\\, while interesting\\, could have been more... Star Warsy. During this scene\\, we feel like on earth\\, in Monaco. No difference. They play the same games. Surely in a Galaxy far\\, far away and a long time ago\\, creatures play other games than black jack or slot machines ? This a typical example of a waste. And never Lucas would had invented such an earthy moment. \\n\\nI am not as severe as other fans but I understand their frustration though. I just hope Kennedy will take their points into consideration if she doesn't want to be the one responsible for the \\\"death of Star Wars\\\" by Disney. \\n\\nMaking money is something. Pleasing the fans and spectators is another. With such a bad percentage of satisfied viewers for a Star Wars movie\\, Kennedy and Abrams has some issues they must sort out for the next one. And the professional critics show\\, once again\\, the gap they have between them and the public they supposed to influence. More and more their opinions won't count.","true":true}
