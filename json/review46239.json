Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning: Spoilery opinion ahead! \\nIf the big plan for the Star Wars franchise is the wrap up the Skywalker saga in episode 9 and then begin to turn out new stories that won't be beholden to what has come before then I don't understand why the Disney creatives felt the need to neuter Luke's storyline by not placing he and his sister at the forefront of this last trilogy. Instead\\, what we have been given are two movies that kill off characters that the audience already has an established emotional connection with while introducing us to characters they tell us to care about instead. The best part of The Last Jedi were those scenes where Luke was in them. That is over  now. What a waste of 30 years of build up! Who knows\\, maybe they'll knock it out of the park in episode 9. Or maybe they'll retread old storylines again.","true":true}
