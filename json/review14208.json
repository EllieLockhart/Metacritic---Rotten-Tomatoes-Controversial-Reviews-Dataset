Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I get the complaints. Lots of pointless story lines that went nowhere.\\n\\nEnjoyed the movie\\, but definately didn't walk away wantingto see the next one.","true":true}
