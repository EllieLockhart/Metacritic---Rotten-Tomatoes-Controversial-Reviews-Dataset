{"101487":136546,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving this review the lowest possible rating for one reason: I can't even hate it. I cannot summon the emotional energy to do so. There are many things wrong with the film\\, but though I'll complain about them\\, I'm left with feelings of emptiness after watching\\, not hatred. Alas.\\n\\nMostly\\, Last Jedi felt like a chore to watch. LONG stretches of boring nothingness. So much of it was pointless visual fluff\\, they could have easily improved the film simply by removing it. It wouldn't have made it good\\, like A New Hope was saved and made great in the editing process\\, but it would have been better. \\n\\nI can see why Mark Hamill said he hated everything done with his character. It's neither a good nor interesting change. I guess that's being \\\"different\\\"\\, but different does not equal good. Rey is sill a Mary Sue\\, but at least they gave some kind of answer to her parentage: nobodies! That came across as more of a \\\"gotcha\\\" moment to me. Sure\\, this was generally true of the Jedi until Anakin\\, but it's insulting to build it up as something important only to response with \\\"psych!\\\" *Groan*\\n\\nI was expecting to see more open SJW type content\\, because that's just the trend these days\\, but it wasn't there in an \\\"attack your fanbase\\\" kind of way. Nevertheless\\, I did feel a lot of (superficial) diversity for diversity's sake (which I did not with Rogue One\\, which I actually quite enjoyed\\, and made the kind of bold decisions I wouldn't have expected but loved).\\n\\nI do have to say that Admiral Lady So & So\\, my god. She didn't just project weakness\\, she was unbelievably stupid-stretching the Dilbert Principle to its maximum. When she's left behind on the ship to remain as a sacrificial target (after allowing things to have gotten as bad as they have\\, losing the confidence of our claimed hero characters)\\, what does she do when the First Order targets the transport ships? She just kind of watches for awhile\\, and then after however ungodly long a time it was\\, she suddenly realizes \\\"hey\\, maybe I should ram their big ship with mine\\, since this was a suicide mission on my part anyway!\\\" Is this the \\\"strong female leadership\\\" we're supposed to worship? That's okay\\, they didn't have strong leadership period\\, so it's not sexist.\\n\\nThey did try to break up the long stretches of tedium that managed to get a couple of slight chuckles out of me. I wonder if they think they were being clever\\, because they weren't. I'm not sure if I actually found it slightly funny\\, or it was in sympathy for their embarrassment. \\n\\nThey did try to have their emotional moments\\, all of which felt unearned to me. I don't think we are given a reason to care about any of the characters\\, including the old guard. That moment where Finn is about to do his own crash run (being the only one left in the run and going full speed)\\, is magically caught up to by sudden girlfriend\\, who \\\"saves\\\" him (in a way that  totally would have killed him\\, if the writing were honest)\\, and now they're together or something? I get it\\, she's an awkward nerd clich\u00e9 type\\, but nothing justifies that moment. With all that wasted time\\, they could have given us a reason to believe that moment was justified. It was not.\\n\\nYoda is throwaway fan service\\, and one which raises some questions. If he can do that as a force ghost\\, what unspoken rule is there that prevented both him and Obi-wan from fixing the whole Sith problem themselves after death (since they apparently still cared after becoming one with the Force). It seems they didn't bother to help Luke (ridiculously incompetent himself as a teacher) in rebuilding the Jedi Order. However\\, I will agree that Luke's criticisms of the Jedi and how they conducted themselves is extremely accurate (not that I can see George Lucas agreeing).\\n\\nIt was visually impressive\\, though I never felt any real tension when the fighting happened\\, and there was no joy in what little lightsaber fighting happened.\\n\\nI suppose there might be some kind of entertainment value in this film\\, but I think it is (emotionally speaking) at the bottom of the Uncanny Valley in just how soulless it truly is. And it's for that reason that I cannot hate it. I'm left not giving a damn about it or the franchise's future. While I never trust the professional critics (and there may be some cynicism here over Disney's potential influence over them\\, but I find them pretentious snobs anyway)\\, that ANYONE could honestly like this film surprises me. I don't even see how it can pander to that particular political crowd that that loves or hates anything (or claims to) on nothing more than identity. I would have imagine them feeling insulted.\\n\\nDisney\\, to paraphrase Zoidberg\\, your movie is bad and you should feel bad (you won't\\, because of how much money it's already made\\, but you should).","true":true}
