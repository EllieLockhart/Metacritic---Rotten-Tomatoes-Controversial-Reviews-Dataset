{"101487":136058,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVE the Rebellion from the Original Trilogy.\\n\\nI HATE the Resistance from the new one.\\n\\nAll the protagonists in The Last Jedi are so unlikable and so inept (except for Rey\\, who is sublime perfection) that I found myself wishing they would all die.\\n\\nDisney\\, we have a problem.\\n\\nI WOULD be rooting for the First Order\\, but they are total jokes and completely inept\\, too!\\n\\nSo I root for the only establishment with any sort of respectability and competence in the movie. I root for the MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.\\n\\nAnd in the real world I root for white\\, male war veterans having a backyard steak BBQ while watching the Kentucky Derby on NBC and talking about all the stocks they own. \\n\\nThey are evil incarnate\\, to be sure.\\n\\nOr at least according to Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney STAR WARS\\, they are.\\n\\nIn reality\\, THE LAST JEDI is a lab experiment that Disney thrust on the American public (and the world at large).\\n\\nThey know the one way to get the rats into the laboratory is via a new STAR WARS movie\\, especially when Force Awakens (although not a great movie) teed up TLJ so brilliantly.\\n\\nThen there was the year-long marketing push by Disney: \\\"THE LAST JEDI: ANSWERS REVEALED!\\\"\\n\\nFollowed by bullying the theaters to carry the movie for four weeks or face \\\"repercussions\\\".\\n\\nAnd then they clearly and obviously paid off or strong-armed the critics.\\n\\nThe public was frothing at the mouth in a frenzy (myself included). 90% of the hype created by Disney\\, itself. All we wanted was to escape back into the STAR WARS mythos for a couple of hours. Taste that magic again. Hundreds of millions of people in straightjackets glued to our chairs ready and willing to accept (just about) anything STAR WARS.\\n\\nAnd then they injected us with their new serum: THE LAST JEDI\\n\\nTHAT is the true story of this abominable movie (which had no story itself). The audience. The STAR WARS generation. \\n\\nEXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 1\\n\\nDemolish the old. The past doesn't matter. The previous Trilogies were pockmarked with bigoted\\, idiot curmudgeons who held everyone down. They are evil. They have no honor. You should feel ashamed for even liking those movies.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 2\\n\\nTHE MILLENNIAL MASTER - this is the new direction Disney is taking THE FORCE. Grey Snowflakes. Everyone gets a trophy. Everyone gets a job. Everyone is a master of THE FORCE. No training. No hard work. Nothing. I want that fucking bag of Skittles across the cafeteria in that kid's hand. BAM! Now it's in my fucking hand\\, bitch! I can't wait to see Rey train the first generation of Grey Snowfla- (ummm\\, I mean Millennial Masters). \\\"I've gathered you all here for this momentous occasion. Your first lesson will be..... hmmm.... your first lesson will be... Congratulations! You are all Millennial Masters!!!\\\" \\n\\nEXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 3\\n\\nThink like us. We know better. We're Disney. You can trust us. I know you didn't ask for them\\, but here are our core beliefs. White men are evil\\, or complete fools\\, usually both. Non-white people are good. But non-white males are idiots. Women know all\\, and should lead in peacetime and war\\, and men should be put down. The wealthy are evil. Capitalism is evil (from Disney! Hah hah) Eating meat is evil. Domesticating animals is evil (but child slavery\\, ehhh\\, that's OK.) There IS no good and evil!!! (talk about contradicting oneself!) The First Order isn't really bad\\, actually. Are they any worse than the Resistance? Compared to the EVIL military industrial complex\\, The First Order hardly rates at all. Kylo Ren is misunderstood (and kinda cute!). He might even agree to go out with you if you are nice to him. Bad boys are so sexy when they are abusive. In short\\, the Resistance is not fighting for freedom from the First Order\\, that's just a fake movie charade.  WE are fighting to overtake your minds\\, teach you what to think. This isn't a movie\\, really. We're here to tell you what to believe and how to live your lives.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTATION - LEVEL 4\\n\\nWe're coming for your children. \\n\\n(Here's your fucking Snowflake decoder ring\\, Timmy. Now you're a MILLENNIAL MASTER! Buy more toys! [pushes him away by the face])\\n\\nThis is their master experiment.\\n\\nBut they failed. \\n\\nThey fucking FAILED! Their hubris ruined their plan. It is so in-your-face\\, STAR WARS fans couldn't help but recoil from the snake that is The Last Jedi. The movie was an affront to our whole identity as lifetime fans.\\n\\nThe vast majority of the STAR WARS faithful woke up from the trance\\, and said NO FUCKING WAY!  Get out of our fucking lives.\\n\\nYou destroyed STAR WARS! You fucking assholes. \\n\\nYou hear Last Jedi apologists continually talk about the main protagonists continually \\\"FAILING\\\"\\, and how this is somehow so \\\"innovative\\\"\\, when in fact it's a total cop-out and a bullshit lie. \\n\\nLet me see... wasn't THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK all about failure\\, head to toe? Why\\, yes\\, come to think of it\\, it was. \\n\\nBut the DIFFERENCE between the two movies is that the characters in ESB weren't INEPT.\\n\\nThey didn't lose their honor. \\n\\nTheir actions didn't make them unlikeable. \\n\\nThe were fulfilling the heroes journey\\, and failure (with honor) is an integral part of it.\\n\\nThe apologists aren't completely wrong about LAST JEDI\\, though. In a way\\, it is completely about FAILURE in a (sort of) innovative way. Failure in leadership. Failure while being emasculated\\, inept\\, dishonorable. Failure to tell a coherent\\, compelling story. Failure to develop compelling characters\\, failure of plot\\, failure of continuity\\, failure of tone\\, failure of execution\\, failure of message. Failure on its own\\, failure as part 8 of a 9 part saga\\, failure as a STAR WARS movie.\\n\\nCongratulations apologists! THE LAST JEDI is all about failure. It is a PURE\\, DISTILLED\\, CRYSTALLINE\\, ELEMENTAL\\, SYNTHESIZED\\, UNMATCHED\\, UTTER FUCKING FAILURE.\\n\\nIt FAILS.\\n\\nRyan Johnson is like a six year old trying to copy THE MONA LISA (ESB) using broken crayons\\, and then Disney is selling it to the public AS THE MONA LISA.\\n\\nRian Johnson\\, check it out. \\n\\nGeorge Lucas: Ewoks\\, Jake Lloyd\\, Jar Jar. Look retarded\\, act retarded...\\n\\nOK. Retarded. \\n\\nYou know JJ Abrams\\, 'Force Awakens.'? Rehash of New Hope\\, yes. Another Death Star\\, yes. Retarded\\, maybe. But he set up Last Jedi on a silver platter. Threw you a greasy meatball for an easy Grand Slam. \\n\\nThat ain't retarded. \\n\\nRE-WATCH YOUR MOVIE\\, YOU MORON.\\n\\nYou went FULL retard\\, man! \\n\\nYou NEVER go FULL retard!\\n\\n\\\"Let go of the past. Kill it\\, if you have to.\\\"\\n\\nMission accomplished.\\n\\nSTAR WARS fans won't be fooled again.","true":true}
