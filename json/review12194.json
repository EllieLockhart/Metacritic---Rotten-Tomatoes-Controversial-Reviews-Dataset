Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a Star Wars mega nerd so take that into consideration. I was disappointed with this movie. I had shunted a lot of my problems from the Force Awakens on to this film to fix and if anything TLJ made it worse and now left Episode 9 with a herculean task.\\n\\nThis movie seemed more concerned with subverting expectations and tropes than telling a cohesive story. Was it enjoyable to watch\\, yes. Much in the same way a Marvel movie is fun to watch. But I don't think I will rewatch this move for years to come like I have for the other Star Wars movies. \\n\\nI think that casual fans of Star Wars will be fine with this movie and I don't mean to sound snooty or elitist. Most of this movie's flaws fall into fridge logic. And most people don't waste time in their life sitting around thinking about it. \\n\\nSo yeah take your kids\\, go see it at least once. I'm likely going to see it one more time at least so Disney already won in that regard\\, the people who will be most upset will be obligated to see this movie at least one or two times.","true":true}
