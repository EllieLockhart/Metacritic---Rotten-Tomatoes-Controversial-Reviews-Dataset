Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was awesome\\, fun to watch\\, and engaging\\, but it dropped all the plot-lines the previous film set up and basically ruined the following film's potential selling points. If it wasn't star-wars It'd be fine\\, but it is and you can't drop things like that about a literal saga. Aside from that there was also a disengaging amount of pandering and jarring pacing. The two stars I gave are for the cast. who were wonderful. Mark was great and so was Adam\\, but the movie itself was a hot mess.","true":true}
