Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars saga needs to end! Stories such as Lord of the Rings are great because they have an interesting story with a beginning\\, middle\\, and an end. The drama between the empire and rebellion has become tiresome and has the appearance of being manufactured for the sole purpose of making money. After watching the movie I understand why it received such a poor audience rating.","true":true}
