Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**Spoiler-Free** \\nThere are no plot details here\\, but if you want to avoid being influenced by hints on theme and structure please stop here. \\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nBold\\, beautiful\\, and flawed\\, The Last Jedi is a powerful and polarizing entry in the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\nIn The Force Awakens\\, JJ Abrams looked to revitalize a film franchise that lost the trust of much of its base. What smartly followed was a thrilling but safe jump-start to the franchise\\, which focused on establishing new characters and welcoming back those alienated with a return an original trilogy feel. I enjoyed TFA thoroughly\\, but I hoped that the subsequent entries would leave their own\\, unique mark now that the trilogy was established on sure footing.  The Last Jedi does precisely that\\, taking risks like few franchise sequels ever have. Rian Johnson brings his indie background to the blockbuster with a dynamic camera (gone are the days of Lucas shot-reverse shot)\\, expertly added color motifs\\, and influences from Kurosawa and Westerns; he adds to the Star Wars mythos\\, and subverts expectations for character and plot at every turn. Johnson also paints shades of grey into the traditionally black-and-white ideas of good and evil\\, and explores deeply the themes of confronting and releasing the past\\, heroism\\, restraint\\, and the power and pitfalls of legends. The movie is clearly Rian Johnson's vision\\, but still has a Star Wars feel\\, rich with memorable moments\\, some of the better Star Wars battle sequences.\\n\\nVisually stunning\\, musically evocative\\, well acted\\, funny\\, emotional\\, and thematically rich\\, the Last Jedi's strengths are plenty; as are the missteps\\, particularly in humor undercutting gravitas (what I call \\\"MCU moments\\\")\\, an implausible survival\\, and a prequel-esque sequence within one questionable plot thread. It is understandable why the film is polarizing: taking a beloved property and characters in new directions will alienate a large portion of fans\\, and others may not be able to look past plot holes and character decisions.  It will be fascinating to revisit TLJ in 10 years and see if it remains polarizing\\, follows the ESB path from tepid response to beloved\\, or descends like TPM from polarizing to largely reviled (though to be clear\\, this is objectively a better made film than TPM\\, and has bigger flaws than ESB). As for me\\, I appreciate the flaws but ultimately admire the ambition and achievements\\, and after a second viewing I still fall somewhere from  positive to strongly positive response; the viewer leaves the theater with a lot to ponder and process\\, and that's more than I ever thought I would say for a Star Wars film.","true":true}
