Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was an intellectual take on the Star Wars universe; however\\, if you are not a fan\\, I could see how some parts might become boring or confusing. And\\, there\u2019s the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d factor where the writers and directors were slamming you with tie-Ins; or\\, a pivotal character such as Snoke is killed before we know of him in this Universe. Writing about universes\\, man\\, they\u2019re becoming confusing.","true":true}
