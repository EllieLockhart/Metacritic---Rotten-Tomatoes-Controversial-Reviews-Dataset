Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie but understand the disappointment of its critics. It was different than most of us expected. For me\\, that difference was refreshing and interesting. If we are honest\\, every movie in the original trilogy had its own quirks and they were not perfect. This film deserves more than a single viewing in my opinion to pass final judgement. I am old enough to remember the initial shocked reaction to Empire Strikes Back. Audiences then were not completely sure they wanted a journey where the main protagonist was the son of Darth Vader. It is impossible to please all Star Wars fans as expectations of specific outcomes are so strong.  For those of you wondering if you should see it\\, I would encourage you to watch it and think about it. I plan to see it again.","true":true}
