We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I will start with the good parts:\r+ Sound design - especially when modifying your weapon the details matter.\r+ Level design - some really astonishing game design\\, especially in the aquarium.\r+ The \\\"back in time\\\" missions with Joel and Ellie.\r\rThen\\, what I absolutely hated about the game:\r-  Killing main character based on choices he wouldnt make in the first place. 0 logic there.\r- Abby!!! I honestly felt disgusted playing this character. I had to motivate myself extremely to play as her. There is absolutely nothing to like about her. - Also the whole buffed body doesn't make any sense...  Women apparently didn't have any time to shave their armpits\\, but they do have time to consume steroids. Yeah\\, makes sense... It felt too forced\\, but since Abby had to lift **** move **** carry **** and needed to be a woman\\, oh...lets make her then unrealisticly strong as hell.\r- The storyline. It felt I was playing a political agenda. This was making the game almost impossible to enjoy. I don't want you to force your thoughts on me\\, eventhough we may think the same.\r-  The ending. The last mission made 0 sense. I think it perfectly resembles how the director had no idea what the previous game made it so good.\r\rIn conclusion\\, I will never forgive Naughty Dog for screwing up such a great game and potential. Please never make a 3rd one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
