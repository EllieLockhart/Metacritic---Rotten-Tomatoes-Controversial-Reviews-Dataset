Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made the mistake of watching this film 3 times before coming to terms with the fact that this film did not work. Half the movie is very boring\\, and the climax and ending do a very little to bring any life to the film. The one action scene in the film\\, yes the one action scene in the movie\\, is underwhelming and poorly choreographed. There are very forced and uninspired plot points that do not say anything new about our \\\"new\\\" characters. If I could rename this film I would call it Star Wars: \\\"Running out of fuel\\\" because that is really what the whole movie is a bout.","true":true}
