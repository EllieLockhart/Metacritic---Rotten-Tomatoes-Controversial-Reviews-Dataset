Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst star wars ever! the plot was horrible\\, too much SJW\\, too much non sense\\, I can't believe they did this with star wars! first Ghost Busters\\, now this!!! When are we going to start to see good movies again?","true":true}
