Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It fails for one fundamental reason: It joins the chorus of old\\, tired social justice discontent bludgeoning viewers yet again with a politicized diatribe on income inequality\\, gender inequality\\, race inequality. This isn't a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away...this is another thinly-veiled social critique rather than a Star Wars saga\\, which used to be rightly blind to all this. Barely holding it together is a collection of action sequences in search of plot. It trashes yet again what film has been doing to heroes for decades with another characters who should have grown up by now still lost in moral equivalency\\, paralyzed by other's evil choices\\, and indifferent to innocent suffering. This new cast - and the Luke created for Last Jedi - may be witty and sarcastic for millennial sensibilities - but they have left off the first qualities of heroic leadership: goodness of heart and moral courage. Consigning friends and family to destruction\\, whether because it shocks you that someone might choose evil in spite of you or out of some limpid platitude that we only win by saving what we love not fighting what we hate is neither goodness nor wisdom. It's almost impossible to avoid the irony as Rose has just callously sacrificed everyone so she can murmur that line. It is a juvenile escapism not humanity or compassion. In the effort to politicize Star Wars\\, it has disintegrated the goodness in good guys and left a new cast of immature boys and listless women\\, content to watch others die until they feel in the mood to show up. We respected Obi-Wan of New Hope not because he lacked failures but because he\\, like Han at Cloud City and Luke at Jabba's Palace\\, stared down evil face-to-face and didn't wait for some magic moment of convenience to his comfort level while insensitive to the innocent people at risk by doing nothing. Everyone around them had to race to keep up with them in their rush to do everything in their power. Until good-hearted men like that\\, morally courageous women like Leia and Mon Mothma\\, and compassionate characters like Yoda and Lando return to lead this story\\, I have a bad feeling about this.","true":true}
