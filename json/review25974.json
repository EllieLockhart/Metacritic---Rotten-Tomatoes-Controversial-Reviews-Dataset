Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

A lot of incoherences\\, for example\\, there is 0 gravity in space how you can bombard another ship ?? everybody can control the force without training (poor Luke SW5)\\, Hux is general ? really\\, every decision is stupid\\, Yoda burn books and smiling (they don't know human history to show something like that in a movie) etc...","true":true}
