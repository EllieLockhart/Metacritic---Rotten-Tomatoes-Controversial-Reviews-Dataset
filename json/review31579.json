Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much of this movie was completely unexpected\\, which is why I personally enjoyed it but I'm pretty sure why some people hated it. I don't want to say much as I don't want to spoil anything\\, but I think it is definitely a movie worth seeing.","true":true}
