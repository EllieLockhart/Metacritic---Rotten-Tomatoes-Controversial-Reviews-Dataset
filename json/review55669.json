Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay I have to admit\\, I was somewhat shocked and dazed the first time I watched this movie. I was a little uncertain with how I felt about it. After watching the movie for a second time however\\, I enjoyed it a lot more! I appreciated the risks the director took to make a completely unique movie in the Star Wars franchise. In my opinion\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver really shined throughout the movie. I would've liked a little more focus on the Jedi\\, however after the second viewing\\, I recognized that Johnson was just trying to create a well-balanced focus on all the characters\\, which I think he accomplished. I understand why some of the people are giving harsh reviews on this movie; it is a lot to digest\\, however after having some time to think about everything that happened\\, I understand why the critics have been raving. What Rian Johnson has created is nothing short of a masterpiece\\, sure it's a little unexpected and unique\\, but that's what makes it amazing!","true":true}
