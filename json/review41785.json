Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is racist. I was sorry to see how much of a hot steaming pile this dumped on Luke Skywalker and any other hero's of the Star Wars-they want to kill them and force communism down our throats. Shrek(aka Kim Jun .In. ruins Finns chance to show his heroism.","true":true}
