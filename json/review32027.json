Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers\\, if your a fan of Star Wars then it\u2019s a big FU to the fan. A lot of plot holes in the movie. Like why keep Poe out of the loop? WW2 bombs that defy gravity\\, a slow high speed chance with space ships\\, a Luke shywalker battle that actually didn\u2019t happen\\, build up couple characters and then do nothing with them for example snoke and captain phasma.
