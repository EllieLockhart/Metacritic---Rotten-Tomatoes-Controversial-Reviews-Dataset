Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, I never leave reviews.  However\\, i felt that it was my duty as a decent human being to try to help advise those people who are trying to decide whether or not to see this movie based on a review.  This movie has disgraced Star Wars period.  It ignored everything that was set up by TFA and it also changed the meaning of the Force and of the Jedi order as we know it.  It was long boring and made light saber battle look uninteresting.  I honestly believe Disney is paying critics to positively review this movie.  I just finished watching this movie and cannot find anything positive worth mentioning.  The Director of this movie made all my favorite Star Wars charachters unbearable and the new ones annoying. I sat in a movie theater with only me and my wife and I wondered to myself why no one else wanted to see this movie.  I now know why.  I am not a huge star wars fanatic but I do love the series.  This movie was a mess with no direction\\,  a screwy plot and absolutely zero character development.  I wish somebody would have told me.  I would have saved 50 bucks.  Oh well you live and you learn and if i can help one other person save a little money by not seeing this movie\\, it will make it all worth it.   Cheers!","true":true}
