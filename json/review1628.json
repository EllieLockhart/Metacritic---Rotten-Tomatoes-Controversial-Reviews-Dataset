Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan there is so many issues with this movie. The plot was confusing and drawn out\\, the characters sucked\\, the humor was forced and out of place. How can people say this movie is even close to ESB. I'm all for making a different movie instead of a rehash from the OT\\, but this was attrocious. I had to remind myself throughout that I was watching Star Wars and not Avengers or a Harry potter fan fiction.","true":true}
