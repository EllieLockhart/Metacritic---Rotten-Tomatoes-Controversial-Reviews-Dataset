We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game has amazing graphics and splendid VA and motion capture\\, with a gameplay that is similar to the first iteration with some improvements on some combat parts.However this kind of game suffer from a gameplay that can become a chore\\, because the story is the most important reason you play\\, you just want to know what follows. This is when the game stumble to a pit of mediocre story telling and a plot that happens because the plot need to happens and is the plot that carry the story not the characters\\, on the topic of the characters\\, the story disrespects the characters from the first game on an attempt to create shock and subvert expectations. The game tries to give morality to an immoral with an at best an inconsistent  values and at worst a forced narrative.It is plausible to make a cruel narrative with moral gray areas and be masterpieces like Schindler's List or Saving private Ryan. This game lack what makes those movies not fun\\, but a great piece of art.In conclusion\\, repetitive gameplay\\, beautiful graphics and VA\\, but a story that is so poor that it belongs to fanfiction with no real character development apart from a screaming inconsistent and biased message.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
