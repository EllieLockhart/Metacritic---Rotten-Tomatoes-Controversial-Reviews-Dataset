Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The list of what is wrong with the film is very long\\, but basically\\, The Force Awakens set up a lot of big reveals\\, and The Last Jedi didn't deliver on any of them. It was a deeply unsatisfying film. Mark Hamill was great though.","true":true}
