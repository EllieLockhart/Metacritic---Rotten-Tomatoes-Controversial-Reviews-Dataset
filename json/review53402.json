Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. I was really looking forward to this movie but it was just a mess. There were some good moments\\, but when I look at the movie overall ten good minutes can save it. The plot was a mess all over the place and full of holes. Let's not even talk about consistency problems with the previous Star Wars. I don't pay enough attention to this franchise to know every single detail so I mainly take each one as it is. That being said\\, I still felt like this movie had consistency issues from The Force Awakens. But the main problem was the whole plot involving Finn and Rose. In fact if you just cut Finn and Rose and every character they interact with during the first half\\, this would be a far better movie. Instead we have a slow plot that makes zero sense full of characters that serve no purpose. What makes it even more upsetting is seeing that Disney is not taking the criticism to heart. This movie has issues that could have been avoided. I hope they fix it for the next one. I am not longer really excited to see the following movie and that tells me a lot.","true":true}
