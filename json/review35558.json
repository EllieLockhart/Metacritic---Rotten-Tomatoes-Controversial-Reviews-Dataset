{"101487":175122,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a beautiful disaster of a Star Wars film\\, with plenty to admire and plenty to despise.\\n\\nI'll start with the good. Rian Johnson's film oozes style throughout. The visual and sound effects are top notch\\, and I wanted to stop the movie\\, rewind\\, and re-watch some shots just to appreciate the artistry that went into them. Rian Johnson is phenomenal at crafting scenes\\, and most of the scenes he makes stand well on their own merits. The acting is\\, for the most part\\, excellent\\, and Mark Hamill easily steals the show\\, throwing himself into a role despite the actor's very public misgivings about the director's choices. \\nThere are some elements that are just kind of there. The musical score is mostly recycled from previous movies\\, with no memorable new songs; while I enjoy the musical heritage of Star Wars\\, I was mildly disappointed with the lack of any compelling or iconic new theme with this movie. The Last Jedi strongly features alien animals like the baby penguin-like porgs\\, the crystal foxes\\, and the racing animals; these are visually interesting but add nothing of consequence to the movie. Humor has been dialed up a lot in this movie\\, to the point where it becomes an end in itself rather than the kind of character-building banter seen between the leads in previous movies; this works for some people and doesn't work for others.\\nWhere The Last Jedi goes wrong is with its writing and storytelling. Rian Johnson is great at crafting shots and scenes\\, but he stumbles badly at assembling these into a coherent story. The movie suffers from pacing issues and irrelevant plotlines\\, and it frequently fails to obey its own logic\\, let alone the precedents of previous Star Wars movies. While these failings would be tolerated in an unrelated science fiction movie\\, The Last Jedi is supposed to be a Star Wars Saga movie\\, and The Last Jedi truly falls on its face as a Star Wars movie. Johnson built this movie from the ground up to break expectations\\, and the movie accomplishes this\\, but it does so by flagrantly disregarding and actively invalidating the setting\\, characters\\, narrative structures\\, and setups of the previous Star Wars movies. Here are some examples: (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) \\nLuke Skywalker\\, the man who risked everything to bring out the good in Darth Vader\\, decided to murder his nephew in his sleep because he sensed the possibility of evil within him. Then he runs away to sulk as a hermit for the rest of his life and destroy what little legacy is left of the Jedi. No explanation is given for these radical changes in Luke's character.\\nA mighty fleet is destroyed by a single rebel cruiser doing a kamikaze attack using hyperspace. This tactic is shown to be so powerful that it unwittingly invalidates the plot of almost every Star Wars movie made to date. What's the point of building a Death Star when a hyperdrive on a rock could smash a planet? What's the point of finding a weakness to the Death Star when a hyperdrive and a rock could destroy it? Why worry about an enemy fleet when a hyperdrive and a rock could wipe it out? No explanation is given of why this tactic works or why it hasn't been done before.\\nRey becomes a fully trained Jedi Knight with essentially no training whatsoever in this movie. Contrast this with the rest of the saga. Luke Skywalker learned the ways of the force from two Jedi masters and spent a significant amount of time and effort doing so. This was an exceptional case; Jedi in previous movies are described as beginning their training at a very young age. \\nHeroic sacrifice to destroy a great threat and save one's friends is regarded as a good thing in Star Wars up until this movie. In this movie\\, a character is berated and demoted for doing this. Then the same people who berated and demoted the character do the same thing\\, and are portrayed as being wise and righteous. The only apparent difference between the bad heroic sacrifice move and the good one is the gender of the person making the heroic sacrifice. Given the public statements from Lucasfilm's president and both directors of this Star Wars trilogy\\, this is a very deliberate distinction that stems from their very public political philosophies. \\nStar Wars has always made allegories to historical political events and movements to aid its storytelling. Imperial officer uniforms are based on Nazi SS uniforms\\, the original Star Destroyers were meant to invoke Teddy Roosevelt's White Fleet and its global show of force\\, and the Death Star was meant to invoke the destructive power of nuclear weapons. The Last Jedi inverts this by using its story to issue overt judgments on modern political issues such as the evils of greedy capitalism\\, gambling\\, and animal\/child exploitation. On an ironic side note\\, the Star Wars video game EABattlefront II\\, which was timed to coincide with this movie's release\\, has been publicly lambasted for its greedy business practices and gambling mechanics in a game targeted at children. \\nThe Force Awakens set up many mysteries for fans to ponder: Rey's lineage\\, Snoke's origins and motives\\, the Knights of Ren\\, and Luke's lightsaber to name a few. Johnson either ignores these setups or dismisses them with disdain. The effect is jarring and smatters of a lack of a coherent over-arching story. In a sequel film that is supposed to set up another sequel\\, this is a problem. \\nThese rejections of what have come before aren't likely to bother people who aren't fans of Star Wars\\, and even among fans of Star Wars\\, those who subscribe to the philosophy of postmodernism and enjoy deconstructing social constructs seem to love it. Among fans who care about these story elements\\, however\\, this movie's deconstructionist approach comes across as sophomoric and trolling. \\nRian Johnson was so determined to break the setting's conventions that he broke the setting itself. In his eagerness to take the franchise in a new direction\\, he tore down everything and replaced it with nothing. The Last Jedi was a celebration of nihilism\\, and if that's where Disney is taking Star Wars\\, then I want no part of its future.","true":true}
