Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another waste of time and resources. Sad to see the franchise go down the route to dumb the script and concentrate on spectacular set pieces that in the end doesn't add anything meaningful to the plot or even make sense. The equivalent of fast-food to movies.","true":true}
