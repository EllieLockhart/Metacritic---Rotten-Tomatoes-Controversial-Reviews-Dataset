Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This not Star Wars we have been bamboozled now I see what mark Hamill was trying to warn us about he   set things up episode 7 and all the mystery and Ryan came and make his own story dismissing everything we was shown in episode 7 this is very disappointing starting to see Blatantly separating Finn and Rey because fan boys didn't to see a interracial couple into shape of form straight reactionary","true":true}
