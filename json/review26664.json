Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, in a non-spoiler way\\, let me tell you why The Last Jedi is not only not a bad movie\\, but is actually one of the best Star Wars movies to date. \\nStar Wars has a formula called the excitement curve. This allows excitement to keep building up throughout the movie without the audience getting tired of action. A big thing\\, but then a dive to more mundane things. Exposition\\, the spiritual lore of the Force\\, whatever. But then something big is built up to\\, and we get another crescendo\\, then we drop back down\\, but higher than the previous drop.\\nThe Last Jedi used this theory\\, too\\, but they did something different. Those dips don't feel like dips. They're filled with so much humor and character moments that you don't mind when action scenes with space ships and lightsabers aren't on screen. In fact\\, the big action scenes pepper in the humor and character moments as well\\, resulting in the whole movie having a more consistent tone than previous Star Wars movies.\\nThis ends up making the curve feel like when a peak happens\\, we have a straight line going across until we build to another peak\\, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time\\, but without getting tired of all the action.\\nNow\\, the I'm not entirely certain why non-critics are saying the movie is bad\\, but the biggest theory going around is that they were too hyped\\, so whatever came out wasn't what they imagined it was going to be\\, so they hate it. Now don't get me wrong\\, there are things I can nitpick (but I won't here because spoilers)\\, but at the end of the day\\, that doesn't make it a bad movie.","true":true}
