Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"La pelicula mas controversial de la saga\\, y estoy del lado de los que la ven con buenos ojos. Mucho se critica el hecho de que R\u00edan Johnson \\\"destruy\u00f3\\\" por completo la escencia de Star Wars\\, sin embargo yo pienso lo contrario. Es una historia nueva\\, totalmente arriesgada\\, no busca complacer con fanservice al espectador\\, si no contar algo nuevo\\, algo desconocido\\, tiene la mejor fotografia de toda la saga. Buenisima pelicula.","true":false}
