Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a shame. Rian Johnson was at least a competent writer\/director and I had some hopes. But The Last Jedi has severe script issues\\, severe pacing issues that stem from the poor script\\, severe editing issues that stem from the poor script\\, severe character issues including lack of development of pertinent characters and introduction to unnecessary characters\\, all of which derive from the poor script. The directing was lackluster and failed to evoke any of the great cinematic language that we've seen and learned from over the last 90 years. There was no great camera composition\\, telling us important information through framing and movement. There was no powerful\\, unique editing. The reactions of some of the prominent characters upon seeing one another was like a TV soap opera; everything just felt poorly directed and poorly thought out. Many plot points took up valuable screen time and then were thrown away.  In addition\\, this was pretty much a copy of Empire\\, which is ironic given the underlying theme this film seems to be preaching\\, which is \\\"Leave the past; bury it\\, and move on.\\\"\\n\\nAs an experiment\\, consider the two stories of Empire: Luke goes to Dagobah to seek Yoda and be trained. Han & Leia run from the Empire and develop a relationship.  THAT'S IT.  Tight\\, focused\\, easy. The characters we love have a boffo action-packed opening and part ways\\, then the business of the plot happen as both stories develop naturally\\, and then everything converges like magic to Cloud City\\, where everyone is almost reunited but beloved Han has been taken away. It's simple. It's effective. It works... because there's no filler\\, nonsense\\, pandering-to-China-box-office\\, painful Star-Trek-V-level-corny humor and undeveloped character motivations clogging up the works. Instead\\, we get plenty of screen time for us to see Luke develop and sow the seeds of both his doubt in himself and his loyalty to his cause. And we get to see plenty of screentime as Han & Leia realize they don't just need each other\\, they NEED each other.  And it's all due to Vadar's relentless pursuit.  We all know the danger\\, we all know what's at stake. We need NO exposition\\, save for the opening crawl\\, and we're set. That's the sort of efficiency that a decent story can provide. You run with it and let your actors and your talented DP\\, composer and crew create the magic inside of it.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi has very\\, very little of this\\, and instead feels like a Verbinski-helmed Pirates Of The Carribean sequel: overbloated\\, overstocked\\, overwritten\\, over-everything. It needed four plotlines\\, three characters and forty minutes cut out of it. There is a seed of a good story in this movie. But it cannot be found amidst the riff raff.","true":true}
