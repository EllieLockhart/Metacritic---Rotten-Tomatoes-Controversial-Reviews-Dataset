Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it the best Star Wars film ever? Probably not\\, but it does at least match 'The Empire Strikes Back'. I do feel I'll need to see it again to take everything in and not watch it while tired\\, but overall I left the screen quite pleased. Rian Johnson creates a strong and unique work\\, and while I can see some things annoying some fans but the movie takes bold steps and it mostly works. As far as cast goes\\, everyone is quite strong. Adam Driver really gets to come into his own as Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley seems more comfortable as Rey and has some struggles to overcome this time around and it makes her a more compelling hero. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are the best version of Luke and Leia that they've ever been\\, strong characters worn down by years of struggles\\, fighting and loss. Oscar Isaac deserves a particular shout out\\, his Poe Dameron  becomes an essential  but reluctant leader and he shines as the naive trigger happy star pilot who needs to learn about making the tough call and you can see they realise how he was wasted in 'The Force Awakens'. I won't start stating what I disliked as it may run into spoiler territory and that'd be unfair on anyone who hasn't seen this film yet\\, but it's more that there was a number of small issues that added up to be annoying rather than one big thing and in the grand scheme of the film\\, it still comes out looking pretty good.","true":true}
