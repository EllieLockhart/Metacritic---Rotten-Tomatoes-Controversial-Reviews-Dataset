Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the fact that I did not see a few of the story choices beforehand. I was never quite sure what was going to happen next. The worst part of the movie is the subplot with Finn and the new character Rose\\, it added little to the story and felt like a CG filled mess. There are some logical inconsistencies as well\\, but that is a common feature of most movies now and days.","true":true}
