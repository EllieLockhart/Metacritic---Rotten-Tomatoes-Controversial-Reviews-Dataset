Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A so-called film of endless cliches\\, tasteless plots\\, bland heroes & villains\\, one-dimensional characters\\, plot-devices\\, plot-holes\\, vacant character development\\, atrocious character execution\\, uninspired writing prompts\\, purposelessness\\, plot-induced-stupidity\\, a counterfeited soundtrack\\, and is overall a carbon copy of The Empire Strikes Back. The future for Disney's new Saga is grim\\, to say the least.","true":true}
