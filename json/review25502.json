Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers\\, but I loved it.  I really did.  The flow was a bit odd until I saw it a second time\\, but then\\, I was exhausted when I first watched it. \\nIt's a great flick\\nMost of the negative comments are from people that went in with preconceptions.  \\nI avoided the trailers.  I'm glad I did.  \\nI really REALLY liked it.","true":true}
