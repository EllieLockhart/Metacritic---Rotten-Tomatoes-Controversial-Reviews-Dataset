Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was much better than The Force Awakens. Although it's not a perfect film\\, it doesn't feel like a clone like TFA\\, and feels like Star Wars whereas Force Awakens felt like it was missing something (emotion\\, feeling\\, etc). This one has humor\\, emotion\\, great space battles\\, and funny critters.\\n\\nI would rank it close to Rogue One\\, not as good as Episode 3 or the original trilogy\\, but better than Ep 1\\, 2 and TFA.\\n\\nAll the babies crying that this film sucks because it didn't follow the formula they wanted need to get over it because this was definitely a great movie that's worth seeing.","true":true}
