Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, The Last Jedi is certainly no Empire Strikes Back-- it is at least not Attack of the Clones.\\nHowever\\, it is the most non-conventional Star Wars movie yet\\, even with the jedi barren Rogue One. The humor and dialogue in this movie are lackluster at best\\, and actually hurt the movie's tone heavily at times (I'm looking at you\\, weird ghost-Yoda). \\nThe classic Star Wars mythos is strong in this movie\\, and the plot provides a great sense of consequence. Overall\\, a\\, weird\\, high-note for the franchise.","true":true}
