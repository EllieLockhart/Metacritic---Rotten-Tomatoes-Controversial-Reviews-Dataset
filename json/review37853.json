Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were two great Star Wars movies before The Last Jedi - A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back - which were both great in very different ways. The Last Jedi is the third great Star Wars film\\, also in its own\\, very different ways. At its heart its movie about failure\\, about how people respond to the failures of their pasts often by failing again.","true":true}
