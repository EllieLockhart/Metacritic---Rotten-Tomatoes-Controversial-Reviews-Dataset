Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all the talk of \\\"Subverting Our Expectations\\\" this movie has more plot twists than the whole star wars series to the point where they arent even twists anymore\\, taking away the tension of scenes. This movie also ruins the shared universe of Star Wars\\, not only with making Hyperspace just going really fast\\, not like in other forms of Star Wars media where you enter a type of wormhole. Overall\\, this movie is a general cluster**** of a film and does not deserve the rating it has.","true":true}
