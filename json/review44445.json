Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much plotholes\\, too much humor in a serious movie\\, and even more questions than the previous film. Also the fact that Rian Johnson has to explain each scene cause it has so many questions just shows that your movie was horrible. Let's not forget the Finn and Rose subplot that basically with or without didn't do anything to advance to storyline. All it did was make a political agenda in a si-fi movie. PATHETIC","true":true}
