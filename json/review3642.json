Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars since Empire. Finally trying new things and evolving. Definitely not perfect\\, and some moments weren't given the grandure they deserved. But the thematic elements and how they blended together were well written\\, the cinematography and score were beautiful and\\, as a good Star Wars film should\\, it inspired me with a message of hope for the future.","true":true}
