Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson tried to hard to get cute here. He moved too far off from the previous movie completely ignoring some of the setups..... good movie\\, but for real Star Wars fan\\, a total joke of a story.....might as well just call it galactic wars as this has nothing to do with Real star wars","true":true}
