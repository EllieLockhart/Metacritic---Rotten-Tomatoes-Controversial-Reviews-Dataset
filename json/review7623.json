Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything JJ built and crafted very very well and left\\, those Characters\\, plot GEMS\\,  throw to the trash in the most dull quick way you could imagine\\, Leve the cinema very very disappointed.\\nSome parts of the movie were so ridiculous that ppl look to each other with THAT look. (Swear to god)\\n\\nOh and I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THE FORCE AWAKENS.","true":true}
