Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars at its most daring and exhilarating since Empire Strikes Back. As someone who found The Force Awakens to be a very fun if slightly familiars romp that reminded me why I enjoy Star Wars so much and Rogue One to be an entertaining take on the more \\\"war\\,\\\" side of Star Wars that lacked when it came to crafting characters that I truly cared for\\, this is the experience I've been waiting for. Ryan Johnson and all involved have truly delivered. The new generation is finally truly here and I hope from this point forward\\, we continue to get daring\\, character driven stories that really prove that Star Wars takes place in a Galaxy\\, far far away.","true":true}
