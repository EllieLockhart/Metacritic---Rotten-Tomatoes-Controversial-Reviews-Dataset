Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Equal parts familiar and different\\, this is a different Star Wars for a different world\\, but with enough typically Star Wars-ian tropes to fit in the Star Wars universe.\\n\\nIt?ll definitely be a marmite movie in that people will either really like it or hate it. There is certainly a lot more humour than the recent Star Wars movies (and yes Star Wars always has been full of humour)\\, but this humour helps to relieve and add a counter point to the dark stuff that also happens. \\n\\nAfter watching it\\, leaving the cinema talking to my friends I couldn?t think of words to say\\, I just had to come home and process\\, I loved pretty much every moment. A brave new direction for Star Wars.","true":true}
