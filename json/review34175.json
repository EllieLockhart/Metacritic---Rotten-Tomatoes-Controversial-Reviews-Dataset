Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you Disney and Rian Johnson for destroying my childhood heroes and making Star Wars a big joke. I'll always be a Star Wars fan no matter what but the disappointment feeling that I still have 4 days after seeing TLJ will never go away. Not even J.J Abrams can't fix what Johnson as done with the last episode. Only Han Solo was properly used in the new trilogy\\, every time he was on screen\\, the young kid in me was reborn but unfortunately it wasn't the same for Leia and Luke. What was the point of bringing them back if it was to poorly used them. I still can' get over the Superman scene of Leia in space and as for Luke a jedi master hero turn into an hermit who tried to kill is own nephew before he could even attempt to turn him...what the hell was that???  Captain Phasma and Snoke had so much potential but were misused and completely irrelevant which is a shame. For what is left\\, I only care about Kylo Ren\\, as for the rest they could all die or be written off and I wouldn't care at this point.","true":true}
