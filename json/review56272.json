Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi should change it\u2019s name to Star Wars Escape of the Rebel\u2019s. This movie was so disappointing\\, I was so excited because I love the Star Wars movies. No questions where answered from the Force Awakens. Some people die for no apparent reason and nobody accomplishes anything! This movie was all about the rebels escaping getting cornered\\, escaping and getting cornered again! This movie sucked so much! Not once did two lightsabers ever touch!! Luke literally didn\u2019t do anything throughout the movie. And apparently Le\u00eda has godlike powers and can survive in the vacuum of space\\, who knew that the Force can provide you with air in space. Snoke was more useless in this movie than he was in the Force Awakens and we still don\u2019t know who he is. Kylo and Rey are now Skype buddies via the Force so there\u2019s that. Way to ruin Star Wars for a fan who loved all 6 movies. Worst Star Wars movie ever. ","true":true}
