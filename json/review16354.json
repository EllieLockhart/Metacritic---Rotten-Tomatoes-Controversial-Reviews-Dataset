{"101487":136856,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm only giving this one start because RT doesn't count half or no stars. spoilers Hux was emasculated\\, Luke was corrupted\\, Finn was cheated\\, Poe was made into an idiot\\, Leia was wasted\\, Snoke was mishandled\\, Phasma was called 'chrome-dome' before her being cast aside\\, Chewie was turned into a stage prop\\, BB8 was turned into a super hero\\, Rey was cheapened into a nothing-character... the only character whose story mattered in this one was Kylo. Let's not forget the disaster that was Canto Bight\\, Rose\\, and purple hair. I hope JJ sums up TLJ in the opening crawl for episode 9 so that fans feel free to skip 8 altogether in a rewatch marathon. And Rian Johnson\\, your Star Wars movie sucks. ","true":true}
