Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"just disappointed really.  TFA was a really good start.  So\\, going into this i was looking for more\\, a second half\\, let's dive into right where we left off!  it's like they made this movie and disregarded what had worked well previously. just really weird.","true":true}
