Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just awful. Plot holes\\, bad writing\\, bad CGI\\, and an the worst comedic timing since Jack and Jill. That anyone could enjoy this movie is beyond me. Felt like a 2 and a half hour long bad SNL skit.","true":true}
