Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was the film set to right all of the wrongs of The Force Awakens and the prequels\\, while also promising to be satisfying to fans old and new. Even with the issues that The Force Awakens has\\, it left The Last Jedi with plenty of room to go its own direction and new fans\\, that would surely come back\\, if for nothing else than to see the conclusion of the mysteries setup by the previous film. \\n\\nWith such a promising start and nothing holding it back from being a financial success\\, The Last Jedi had little required of it other than to continue growing the at the time mostly liked characters\\, Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn and Poe\\, while paying respect to the beloved returning characters such as Luke\\, Leia and Chewie. The Last Jedi takes many of the complaints of the previous films and has a knee-jerk reaction\\, going so far the other way that the film has completely divided its faithful source of income\\, its fanbase. While trying to be something for everyone\\, it has stretched itself out to the point of losing what made the original trilogy and to some extent parts of the prequels so beloved.\\n\\nParts of the film are good\\, even enjoyable to watch\\, but for every time there is a scene that is a love letter to the fans\\, there are two dear John letters right after it\\, stabbing the viewer in the back after getting the fans to let their guard down.\\n\\nConsidering the financial success that The Last Jedi is\\, the inevitable sequel to it has a lot to make up for to earn back the broken trust of many of its fans.","true":true}
