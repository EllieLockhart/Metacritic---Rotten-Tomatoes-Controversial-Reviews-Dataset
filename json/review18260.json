Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought  the force awakens was terrible with the mary sue character\\, rehashing of the exact same plot and deterants\\, and sjw agenda\\, but oh boy was I wrong. This travesty of a movie shouldn't even be mentioned anywhere near the starwars franchise. Single handily one of the worse movies(even without the brand) ive seen. The only slight redeeming factor is the fight scene(when you don't factor in destroying established premises like blocking off warp jumps) and cgi. They ruined all aspects of the star wars universe that we loved. All for the sake of sjw agendas\\, money and ruining the starwars franchise(which at this point feels like they did on purpose). It was a big middle finger to fans and its sickening.\\n\\nPaid shills that work for firms that skew public views online(yes there are people paid to do that) are suggesting the outrage from the fanbase are hacking Russian trolls\\, but that is just as ludicrous as calling this a starwars film.","true":true}
