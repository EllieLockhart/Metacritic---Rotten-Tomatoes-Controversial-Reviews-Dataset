Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mostly the same story as ESB\\, just resequenced. Over the top humor and too mich of it. Has some great moments but not enough and a bad plot. Rogue One has set the bar and this falls miserably short. The best line is\\, \\\"You're no Vader\\, just a child in a mask.\\\" That pretty much sums up Kylo and the rest of the movie....a big pretender.","true":true}
