Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS!!!\\n\\nWhat they did to Luke's character stoops to a new low in the franchise.  Poor to useless sub-plots\\, weak character development and incomprehensible choices make this a poor movie.  Kylo is so Gen-X it's pitiful; we get it\\, you're conflicted but make an f'in choice for once in your life for god's sake.  I give it one star for the actors\\, who did a great job despite\\, and the special effects.  The only character I really had any pity for was Snoke for having to deal with Kylo's sorry a$$.","true":true}
