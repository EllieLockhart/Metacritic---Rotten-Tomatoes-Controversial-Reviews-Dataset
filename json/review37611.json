Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is not one thing I enjoyed about this movie. They tried to force in too many plot lines with some of the dullest characters in any sci-fi film while trying to teach us real world values. Felt like this was a sequel to Wing Commander or Battlefield Earth. If this is the director for the next franchise I will not be watching.","true":true}
