Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete and monumental disappointment full of forced humor that fell flat and was completely out of place. Pacing was also an issue. There were parts where it just drug on and on and was honestly boring. The story itself was full of plot holes that didn't make sense that left you scratching your head. Frustrating enough\\, most storylines set up in the previous films were ignored or thrown out. The acting wasn't bad per se but the new characters are all one-dimensional and have no story arc. Every one of them is exactly the same character from beginning to end. You have no vested interest what happens to them. It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. The only thing good I can say about it is the special effects were good\\, that's about it. I do not recommend you watching this and for god sakes don't buy it.","true":true}
