Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best part of this movie was the last 15 minutes. I wish they would have spent more time developing Snoke\\, Rey and Finn's characters instead of wasting time with new useless time wasting characters like Laura Dern\\, the hacker guy and whatnot. For being so strong and evil\\, bad enough to manipulate someone who is as strong with the force as Ben\\, could be killed so quickly with the flick of a lightsaber. The special effects were great but this was such a disappointment. After waiting patiently for three years this movie was such a let down.","true":true}
