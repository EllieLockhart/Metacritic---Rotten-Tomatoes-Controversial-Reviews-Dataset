Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this is the best Star Wars film I've watched. The action sequences are not a mess of explosions ala Michael Bay. In fact\\, the big battles are far and few in-between what is mostly a character-driven story. There's still too much exposition to be desired\\, but it can be forgiven with the genuine desire to tell a story.\\nAction\\, comedy\\, and excitement fans\\, beware. This film may come across as boring to you. There are long stretches of the film that is nothing but just talking and going from point A to point B. If you love Fast and Furious or Transformer-type films\\, you might be disappointed with this one. The best sequence for me was the opening. It's just pure cinema gold.","true":true}
