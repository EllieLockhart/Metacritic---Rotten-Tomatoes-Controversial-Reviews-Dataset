Especially mo-cap is so good you can see slightest emotions and see what the character think and feel even when they are silent.\r\r- Story is great. It does some unexpected (if you avoid spoilers) things we dont usually see in the stories. And makes sure you dont see the story as a simple black and white strunggle between good nice guy vs bad ugly guy that needs to be killed to make the world a better place. It will make you question what you are doing and sometimes can create confused feelings (\\\"Should I feel bad about this if I felt ok with it few hours ago?\\\" \\\"Was it ok to kill that person?\\\"). For me this is something I really appreciate because it is rare and few writers dare to try this. (it is so much easier to say \\\"it is ok to kill these people\\, because they are red on minimap.\\\" And TLoU tries to avoid this approach as much as possible)\r\r-Solid lenght - Took me 30hours to finish. With high roduciton values all the time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
