Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it! I'd give it 5 stars\\, but I'm always hesitant to do that because perfection doesn't exist. Let me preface this with the fact that I have never been a huge star wars fan; the first SW movie I loved was Rogue One. However\\, I've always had great love and respect for the world of SW because I just love stuff like that. Because of that\\, I have the emotional distance needed to see that this is what the franchise needed. They can't keep telling the same story over and over and over again\\, that's not how...well\\, anything works. Besides the fact that that would've gotten old with Empire \\, 70s storytelling techniques simply don't cut it for modern audiences anymore.\\n\\nThis movie is gorgeous\\, both in visuals and in character work. It gives the characters the ultimate respect: it makes them real people. This is most obvious and up-front with Luke. He was never the Legend of Luke Skywalker\\, he was a bit of a dumbass\\, wide-eyed kid from Tatooine who had\\, like\\, a week of formal training and a lot of natural talent\\, and even he bought into his own legend. That's why the ultimate realization of truth affected him so much\\, the same as it's doing for all those outraged \\\"fans.\\\" \\n\\nThe fact is\\, if star wars fans wants star wars to keep going at all\\, the universe NEEDS to grow and evolve and that means letting the characters within the story grow and evolve. It's not \\\"ruining their childhood\\,\\\" the OT will always exist\\, but it will bring new fans more into the fold. For the first time\\, I actually give a shit about Luke Skywalker\\, and that's because he feels like a real person. I'm aware this isn't the most comprehensive review\\, but I needed to get some thoughts out here","true":true}
