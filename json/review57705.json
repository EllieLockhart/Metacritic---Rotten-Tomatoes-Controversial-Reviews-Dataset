Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately\\, despite the strong acting of the lead stars as well as the supporting cast\\, the poor storytelling and lack of vison makes this the worst entry in the sequel trilogy. Rian Johnson wanted to subvert and throw expectations and fan theories but he also threw a new track in plot with having Snoke killed and having Rey written as a nobody. May we never see Johnson's involvement in the Star Wars franchise ever again.","true":true}
