Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was it a terrible star wars movie\\, it was a terrible film full stop. It assumes that the audience is brain dead. Plot holes so massive they break the film's entire continuity. Many many fans have already gone into detail about this so I won't bother with details\\, but I will say it was simply the worst written film I have ever seen. Just because you want to aim the franchise at kids doesn't mean you don't have to at least try to write a coherent story. The special effects we're spot on\\, but that does not a good movie make.  The look may be star wars\\, but the feel of the film\\, the dialogue\\, the acting\\, really the entire atmosphere of the film was just wrong. I get they want to get a new fan base\\, doesn't mean you have to treat the old fans like dirt and disrespect every single one of their heros. Terrible\\, just terrible.","true":true}
