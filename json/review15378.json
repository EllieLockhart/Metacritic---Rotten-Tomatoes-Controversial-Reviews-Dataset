Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love anything starwars\\, and I loved this\\, but I have to give it a poor review\\, because of some stupid plot points.  Two huge battle ships out of range from each other for the whole movie\\, but key characters can whisk in and out when they want too.  You could have just put them on a planet with shield and wasted the same time.  . Oh that would be another movie.....  The force\\, which all of a sudden included 'free' training.   hyperspace\\, that can destroy a flotilla of ships (not to mention get let you fly in and under a planet wide shield).  Next time\\, read the script to a bunch of people and if some of them go 'but how did they.....' then listen.  This film stinks of set pieced with the story made up after.  At the the  Ep 1\\,2\\,3 made sense.","true":true}
