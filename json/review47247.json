Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a pile of S**T. Everything in this movie is trash. Visuals and nothing beyond. They ruined all the old characters\\, while giving a girl who hasn't even known about the force for more than a week\\, into the greatest jedi of all time... with absolutely no training. Literally ruined star wars. Asian girl put into more for nothing more than to have an diversity\\, which in itself seems a bit sketch\\, is worse character than Jar-Jar. I can't believe this is what fans get. F**k Disney.","true":true}
