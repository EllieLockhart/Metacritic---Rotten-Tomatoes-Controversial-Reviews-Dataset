Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just to be clear and to reiterate the majority of reviews on here.... This is an appalling Star Wars film. So many plot holes....so many possibilities wasted...the legend of Luke destroyed for all eternity. \\n\\nI will never pay to see another Star Wars film again. I will endeavor to remember the original films and the excellent books that took the adventures of Luke\\, Leia et al to new levels.\\n\\nTo conclude...the Star Wars film franchise died with this film...","true":true}
