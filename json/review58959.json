We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"There is no other word to describe The Last of Us part 2 but masterpiece\\, this isn\u2019t just a game it is an experience. I am a massive fan of the original and this sequel builds on every aspect of the original. The gameplay - Solid controls and character manoeuvrability\\, everything works as it should and no frustratingly awkward controls like some 3rd person games.  All game mechanics are simply to learn and after a few minutes you will get the hang of them.  Ellie can now swim\\, go prone and jump freely unlike the original game. My only gripe with the gameplay was the boating sections\\, the controls felt tight and these section albeit small felt tacked on but this is a minor gripe.  The graphics-  Easily the best this generation\\, the character models are amazing and you could remove the HUD and think it was a CG movie. The environments are beautifully dirty gritty and realistic. The game never stutters\\, never loads and the cutscenes blend into gameplay seamlessly.  This game pushes the PS4 to its limits.  The story - Here is were a lot of people drop off and start to hate on this game.  Personally I really loved it\\, it was epic\\, massive and you really felt the slog that these characters go through over the course of the few days. All the characters were fully realised and their decisions IMO were justified and I really understood what the game developers were going for with this story.  I think people forget that this is a post apocalyptic bleak world full of monsters\\, horrific people and dredd. How could anyone possibly be able to put themselves in the players shoes and criticise their decisions. Yes this story has LGBT elements and a very minor transgender diversion for one character but all in all it is handled well and fair play to Naughty Dog for adding this much diversity to such a AAA game title. The Good - - an amazing epic story that sucks you in and takes you on a journey with each of the characters. - beautifully fully realised world- stunning set pieces  - game runs buttery smooth - percent controls The Bad -- the game does drag in a few sections - the game rushes a few parts to get you from A to B - Joel doesn\u2019t get as much attention as he deserves.-  very linear levels\\, they feel big but there isn\u2019t much room to explore. The Ugly - - the last couple hours feel that they were slightly rushed as the first 90% of the game takes place over 3 days yet the last 10% takes place over 1-2 years yet is glazed over. In conclusion I think everyone should experience TLOU2 it is a superb title and a worthy sequel to the original.  The developers took a chance with a bold story they could of easily if rehashed the first game and it would of still sold amazingly but they chose to give us something new.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
