Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more times I see this movie\\, the less I like it. Fin essentially repeats the same character development he had in the first movie... like it never happened. Rose was so poorly written it was impossible to relate to her. Poe's character was practically a different person than the previous movie. Rey is a total marry sue\\, Kylo is a ridiculous man child\\, and the way Luke was handled can only be described as character assassination. If Vice Admiral Holdo would have simply said the one sentence \\\"we have a plan\\, but until we know how the first order is tracking us\\, we have to keep it on a need to know bases.\\\"\\, the mutiny would have never happened\\, and there would have been no reason for Fin and Rose to go to the casino planet. Speaking of which\\, the only decision they made on that trip was to park illegally on the beach\\, after they were told not to... everything else happened without any agency on the part of the characters. To make it worse\\, there was nothing enjoyable about the entire story arc. Watching the Blu-ray and skipping all the scenes about Fin and Rose makes the movie more coherent. This is a shame\\, because I really liked Fin in force awakens. Possibly the worst part of the whole movie is toward the end. The resistance is under attack by the laser Battering ram. Fin is about to sacrifice himself... to save the ones he loves... Rose stops him\\, and tells him \\\"we don't win by destroying what we hate\\, we win by saving what we love.\\\" Literally what she just stopped him from doing. The one redeeming factor is the movie had good special effects\\, especially the climax of the space battle. That scene alone was worth the 1 Star I am giving this movie.","true":true}
