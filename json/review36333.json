Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The major problems with this movie fall under complete lack of character development\\, awful story\/plot direction\\, and the over abundance of unmissable plot holes and inconsistencies both within itself and in relation to the rest of the franchise. Unfortunately\\, this year saw the release of the worst Star Wars movie yet.","true":true}
