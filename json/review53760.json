Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great acting\\, score\\, and visual effects: utterly invalidated by poor writing and a total lack of understanding of the setting.  (yeah\\, you have to be a good actor to make writing this abyssmal look as good as it does.)","true":true}
