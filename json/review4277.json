Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst SW film of all time. Critics should be ashamed of themselves. They are either in Disney's pocket or are out of touch with reality.\\n\\nEither way\\, the bad writing\\, the inconsistencies introduced into the SW mythos\\, the exceptional disrespect to the original SW characters\\, the SJW politics and the refusal to acknowledge any fan feedback cannot be ignored simply because \\\"the film wanted to risks\\\".\\n\\nI wanted to love the new series\\, I really did\\, but that is the last SW Disney film I will support\\, and I will do everything in my power to influence others to skip any future films.","true":true}
