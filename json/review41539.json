Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie is Disney\\, not Star Wars. Disney takes a huge sh** on the franchise. Besides that some elements are Disturbing. Like the sexuall milking of some Spacecows. Or the atmosphere of Snokes throne room. This movie is not for children. Except you want your children to be distraught after the movie.","true":true}
