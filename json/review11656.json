Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"horrid\\, god-awful film. rian and the mickey-mousers killed star wars. there's not a single thing about star wars that this movie gets right. this piece of filth makes phantom menace looks like an oscar-worthy film in comparison. do not see it\\, do not give disney your money. I don't know how jj abrams is going to fix this horrid mess in episode 9. I think it can't be fixed at this point\\, rian left his legacy on star wars - a big steaming pile of sh*t. rest in peace\\, star wars.","true":true}
