Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" four times now. I regret nothing about this. To me it is worth it. There is a scene near the end of the movie is so amazing and emotional that any other flaws are forgiven\\, just because that scene exists. The scene is a perfect jewel\\, simply written and beautifully acted.\\n\\nEveryone is great in this film\\, but Mark's acting is just amazing\\, and I am so glad to see that Carrie's last on screen role was bigger and better than what she was given in TFA. Every scene with her makes me smile\\, and also breaks my heart because she won't be around for IX.\\nThe movie is not for everyone\\, I suppose. That's fine\\, I get it. Everyone has an opinion. This is mine: I love it.\\nI plan on seeing it at least once a week until it's gone from theaters.","true":true}
