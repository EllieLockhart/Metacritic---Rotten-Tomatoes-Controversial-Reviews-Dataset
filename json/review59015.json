From the sound design to the art\\, the graphics\\, the animations. Absolutely everything about this game is just magnificent in my opinion. But the story and how the gameplay is connected to the story is what sets this apart from everything else. Gameplay and the story makes you think about the actions you are doing and it's something I don't think I have experienced elsewhere. It's really impressive how Naughty Dog did this. It's impossible to go in greater detail and describe why the game had so massive impact on me without spoiling it\\, and I don't want to do it. Go play this game!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
