Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When the movie ended\\, my wife looked over at me and asked \\\"What's wrong?\\\". I just stared at the credits and responded with \\\"WHAT WAS THAT?\\\"\\n\\nOne hour into the movie I remember thinking that I had no interest in re-watching what I had just seen. It moved so slow and the galaxy felt like it was smaller than ever before. We got to watch a version of Luke that was such a disappointment. Force flying Leia was a disaster. How many more cute space animals\/creatures could Disney squeeze into their theme park gift stores? Snoke was a waste. Phasma was a waste. And the slow motion spaceship tailgating of the other spaceship never ended.\\n\\nMaybe I am most disappointed in the fact that my expectations were just shattered. I thought Kylo Ren would be more powerful and awesome. Instead he was mask-less the entire movie and seemed even weaker than the TFA. We also deserved a powerful and wise Luke Skywalker. Instead\\, we got an old wimpy man who died in a force projecting battle. We've now had 3 straight Disney Star Wars movies without ONE lightsaber battle between two skilled\/trained Jedis (though Vader in Rogue One was an epic solo performance).\\n\\nWe all deserved a battle between Kylo Ren and green lightsaber Luke. Instead we got an invisible tickle battle that somehow killed Luke. Why are we supposed to be excited for Episode IX?","true":true}
