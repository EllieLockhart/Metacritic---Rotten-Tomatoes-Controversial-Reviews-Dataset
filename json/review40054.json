Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first rotten tomatoes rating. I felt obligated as I had been a hardcore STAR WARS fan since childhood. This movie is utterly disappointing in few ways:-\\n\\n1) Fan Made Light Saber Fights are Better than the Ones in the Movie. Literally there is no real saber fight\\n\\n2) If Snoke dies so easliy\\, it proves that Luke Skywalker must be a douche if Snoke can convert Kylo so easily. Its the laziest plot ever\\n\\n3) The Force power used by Luke is stupid and senseless. This is ridiculous and contradicts the entire star wars games\\, concepts and force concepts\\n\\n4) Obviously the director\\, script writer and producer really suck in the entire movie\\n\\nMOST Dissapointed Star Wars Film ever made","true":true}
