Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I at first thought was boldness (fresh from my viewing) I now think of as disrespect and egotistical arrogance - to the fans who made Star Wars the phenomenon it was and to the characters and tone and spirit of the SW movies. And I can no longer ignore the poor job in handling character\\, chemistry\\, motivation\\, plot and sub plot\\, casting....Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson screwed this up in a major way. I am glad he will not touch SW 9. I have no such hope that she will not mar SW 9. Take the time to watch the review videos-it has all been said already. Johnson and Kennedy  made a movie that trashed my favorite characters\\, missed too many opportunities\\, wasted time with inane add-on one nonsense plots\\, and made me feel sick in my gut (something the mediocre middle trilogy never could.)  What a waste and a damn shame. For the first time in my life I have actual resentment and animosity towards figures for a movie they made. Thanks to Mark Hamill for doing so well with what was given him.","true":true}
