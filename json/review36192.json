Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was not good. The story felt very contrived and forced. The pacing was awful. It seemed to just move from scene to scene with no momentum at all. The Rose and Fin story line is just pointless and Fin and Rose have zero chemistry. It really felt like the Rose character was plucked off of a Disney afternoon teen comedy. Love Rae ...that was some good casting and in the Force Awakens all of the new characters have great chemistry. The Last Jedi just doesn't give them anything to work with. Mark Hamill's performance was fantastic but thats about the only good thing about this film. A lot of potential with this one but it was all missed. I'm not even sure I would recommend a rental.","true":true}
