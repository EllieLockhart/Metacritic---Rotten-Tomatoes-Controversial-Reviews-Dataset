Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, in my own opinion the best Star Wars film we've seen. It tops A New Hope (barely) and that's saying something. From the great dialogue to the epic fight scenes\\, almost everything in this film is brilliant. Not quite everything\\, though. The Finn\/Rose sub-plot is the weakest part of the film\\, however this is only when compared to the awe inspiring main act. The story is taken to places Star Wars has never been\\, bu this bold move ultimately paid off for director Rian Johnson.","true":true}
