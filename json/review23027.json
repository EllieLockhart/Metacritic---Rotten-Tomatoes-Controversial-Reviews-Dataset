Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved all the references back to the original trilogy! They were similar but still different. I still don\u2019t really understand why Rey is looking at reflections of herself on the island. I thought that there might be something more\\, like Luke facing Vader in the cavern while training with Yoda\\, but no. I was surprised by Princess Leia\u2019s role due to Carrie Fisher\u2019s passing too. The movie was long but maybe an extended cut will be made that fleshes out some of the characters. ","true":true}
