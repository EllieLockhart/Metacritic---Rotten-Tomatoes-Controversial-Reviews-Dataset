Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney KNOW they're in trouble. Thats why they're doing damage control here on RT and other sites.\\n \\nYes\\, Last Jedi made them an easy Billion but in the long term\\, they've irreparably damaged their most valuable brand. \\nAfter all\\, are YOU planning to see the \\\"Han Solo Spinoff\\\"? Or Episode 9 for that matter??\\n\\nAnd consider this:\\n- Its 2nd week box office plunge\u00a0is the worst in history. \\n- It set a new record for biggest ever sequel-to-sequel box office decline.\\n- In Hollywood's largest overseas market (China) it opened to less than half its predecessor's opening\\, then plunged 94% after the 1st week.  \\n- Its audience score on this site is 10% lower than Phantom Menace and by far the lowest in the saga... and thats with RT helping it!\\n- A petition demanding it 'struck from canon' has 85\\,000 signatures.\\n- And now they're predicting a Han Solo movie flop!\\n\\nStar Wars IS DEAD!","true":true}
