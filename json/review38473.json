Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film ever created.  Kylo Ren's childish temper tantrums and abysmal acting haven't changed since The Force Awakens.  Snoke in Hugh Heffner's robes seems like Disney's attempt at making Jar Jar \\\" work\\\". Sad contemporary humor stinks of millennial pandering.  Mary Sue Rey still cannot act and we're still supposed to care about her mysterious past. Oh and she's basically Wonder Woman after meditating briefly with Luke and swinging a lightsaber around by herself.  Fin and Rose story is contrived\\, outlandish and frankly boring. Weird penguin creatures make no sense at all.  Ice foxes make even less sense but are used as a dull plot device.  The following scenes made me consider walking out:\\nLeia flying through space.\\nLuke milking lizard cows.\\nIsland lizard people custodians.\\nRey dueling Luke.\\nDerfy spectral Yoda regurgitating lines from Empire.\\n\\nNone of the characters felt like real people and the premise of a space car chase time constraint felt underwhelming. \\nI pray that soon my memory of this abomination goes the way of Luke and suddenly becomes one with the force.","true":true}
