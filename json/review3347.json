Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"below average even for the prequels and awful compared to the original trilogy. horrible plot holes and stupid character logic make this film a 2 star  instead of 3 stars for me (from a huge fan who watched growing up) disappointing.","true":true}
