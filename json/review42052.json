Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes the prequels look amazing. The Last Jedi is the worst stars show to date. There's so many things wrong with this film I can't even begin to express them. But the one thing that pissed my off the most was LUKE! They trashed the one epic scene this movie could have had. What a disgrace.","true":true}
