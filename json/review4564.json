Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly i don't understand all the bad ratings that other Star Wars fans are giving.  As an old lover of Star Wars\\,  i completedly love this movie.  If you could see the movie objectively\\,  the movie gave a splendid storytelling and Rian kept an interesting plot and character building throughout the film.  The plot gave a resonance and nostalgia of the old Star Wars movies\\,  yet gave a new\\, unpredictable\\,  and fresh story.  The movie managed to gave eye-dazzling actions\\,  and yet can still carry out the misticism and spiritualism of The Force in movie\\, which i found very rare in box office nowadays.  The only flaw is some scenes seems odd\\, perhaps due to cutting in the process.  But overall\\,  this movie is great and deserves to watch for.  Personally\\,  i liked this movie more than The Force Awakens\\,  which is too much trying to play it save. But who i am to judge.","true":true}
