Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really conflicted about this movie.  My 11 year old son loved it and thought it was fun\\, but as an adult I gave a hard time calling this a good movie\\, let alone a good Star Wars movie. I feel so let down by the \\\"tell don't show\\\" storytelling (for example\\, Rose telling Finn \\\"you're the heroic Finn?\\\" or Poetry saying \\\"Look! X and X are facing off and going to fight\\\").  Don't just tell me someone's a hero or a legend!  Show me why!  I don't know what Rey learned in this movie.  Snoke was the least threatening mega villain ever. And there were so many long stretches where nothing of any consequence happened.  But there is fun spectacle and a few good jokes. But most of the jokes landed flat\\, and the characterization was so secondary to plot. I want to love these characters and empathize with them\\, but after this movie\\, I honestly don't care how it all ends.","true":true}
