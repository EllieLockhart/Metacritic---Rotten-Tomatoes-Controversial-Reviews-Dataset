Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi left me shocked and blown away at the conclusion of the film. I sat in my seat as the credits rolled to let it all sink in. Rian Johnson has crafted a visually stunning movie and subverts your expectations. Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver are the primary drivers of the plot and their portrayals are excellent. The film loses your attention with the B-plot of the Resistance but it\u2019s achievements far outway its downfalls. ","true":true}
