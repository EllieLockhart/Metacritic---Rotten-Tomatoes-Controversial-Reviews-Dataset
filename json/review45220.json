Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unsure why the audience score is what it is... as this film was FAR BETTER than the Force Awakens and instead of just rehashing old material\\, it went its own directions and contained several interesting surprises.\\n\\nI think everyone is upset over one particular thing that should likely be ignored considering the source.\\n\\nIgnore the haters.. go see it!","true":true}
