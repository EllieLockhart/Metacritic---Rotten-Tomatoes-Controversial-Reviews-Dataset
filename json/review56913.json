Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These positive critic ratings are a joke. \\n\\nAnswers given were unfulfilling or incomplete. Pacing was way off. Some good comedy bits but some felt forced and others ruined the buildups. A few scenes that felt like prequel gibberish. Few logical military decisions. Flat characters. Too heavy on BB8 (never thought I'd say that). More extremely lame villains. Just felt half-baked and frayed. Don't get me wrong\\, there were a few excellent scenes that gave me the chills and impressed me. It felt like Johnson was trying to cover too much in too little time. And the missed mark has only sent me away in a crescendo of crushing depression.","true":true}
