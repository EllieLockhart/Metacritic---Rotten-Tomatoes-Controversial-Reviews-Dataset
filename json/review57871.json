Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well this is amazing to me that this film can even remotely be compared to the prequel films\\, I have never seen a more true and nostalgic\\, Star Wars film till this one. It tackles the hardest question of this imaginary universe\\, Why the dark side has to exist and the light to meet it\\, and why one can't be without the other? Sure their are moments that could have been better shot or more writing but same with the original trilogy\\, I watch all of the original and prequel films before seeing this one and it kept true to what\\, I wanted as fan. It never tarnished the legacy of Star Wars. Those who are arguing otherwise don't see that this film is master piece in the Star Wars world\\, a perfect blend of CGI and practical effects\\, and masterful performances from all the actors.\\n\\nJohnson played every one of us\\, none of us new how this film was going to end or really play out throughout the story. In the original films I never wanted to see the dark side win\\, this film flips this thought on its head and leaves the door open in episode 9 for maybe some possible major character development. I could argue all day with upset fans about manny parts of this film but one of these arguments is just opinion\\, really the man create a amazing Star Wars film and I never once while watching this film or the last saw them any where near as awful as the prequel trilogy. And I grew up as a fan of those films they were my generations Star Wars\\, and they have a special place in my heart even though they are lacking in certain aspects. And these just are amazing\\, I care so much about Kylo\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and Maz as characters that i fear for them\\, and even though they are heroes and usually immune to death in these stories seeing the old heroes pass away like Han and now Luke just feels right. and make fear that even the new characters plot armor is not that strong. \\n\\nPeople just don't like to be wrong\\, and Johnson proved all of our theories wrong. So to wrap this up if you go into this film looking for a continuation of the the Original trilogy then you will be disappointed this is a conclusion\\, to that tale and the beginning to a new one. Imagine the Force Awakens as a prequel to the ending of the original cast\\, And Episode 9 the true beginning of Rey's and Kylo's feud.","true":true}
