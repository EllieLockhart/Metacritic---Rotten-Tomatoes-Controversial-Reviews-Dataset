Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've finally seen it and oh boy is it a mess. Simply put\\, The Last Jedi takes everything that was bad about The Force Awakens and amplifies it while ignoring the few actually interesting story elements that the previous movie had established. \\n\\nWhile one should not attribute to malice what can be explained by mere incompetence\\, it's hard to shake the feeling that The Last Jedi was indeed meant as a giant middle finger to fans of the franchise.","true":true}
