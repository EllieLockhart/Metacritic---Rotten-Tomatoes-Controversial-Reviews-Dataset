Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest problem with this movie is with the constant contrivances in this movie that glues all the parts together. In a fantasy movie like this\\, you expect that there will be some due the nature of fantasy movies. I don't remember any other movie I have seen that people acting in ways that are so inconsistent with previous behavior\\, to have plot holes filled by totally improbable explanations (how would Rose know how the First Order is tracking them through hyperspace - also the explanation actually contradicts itself if you actually paid attention)\\, to have big plot holes that the movie doesn't even try to explain (how did BENICIO DEL TORO character know of the plan to evacuate to a planet that only Leia and Laura Dern's character know about \\, neither Finn nor Rose nor Poe knew about that plan - this list would go on for pages)\\, the ignoring of all physics without attempting any explanation (Marvel movies do this all the time\\, but they always invent some way to explain the impossible).\\nThis movie has a great main plot (Rey and Kylo)\\, but all the sub-plots are poorly thought out and drag down the whole movie. Many of these sub-plots had no impact on the final direction of the movie\\, and could have been completely deleted (making the movie shorter and better).\\nThe main 2 characters (Rey and Kylo) were well done and their relationship really worked. That was a good surprise. The problem with Rey is that she is too good in everything that she does. With only 1 hour of training as a Jedi (none of which involves fight training)\\, she defeats Luke in a fight. If she is that good\\, why did she bother to go to Luke to get training\\, she clearly doesn't need it.\\nThis movie is a reverse of \\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\\" where the men's problems are all caused by women. In \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\, all the men are either evil\\, or if they are good they screw up and need a woman to set them straight. Finn tries to run away\\, but Rose stops him. At the Casino\\, Finn is more interested in having a good time then completing their mission\\, Rose sets him straight again. Poe is always going around screwing up missions by being half-cocked\\, and has to be put in his place by Laura Dern's character. The biggest screw up is Luke\\, but eventually Rey gets him back on track. The women on the other hand are all strong and doing the right thing (with the exception of Captain Phasma\\, who is the token woman \\\"bad\\\" guy - she is in the movie for less than 2 minutes).\\nI believe that women and men should be shown to be equal in all movies\\, but this movie swung the pendulum totally in the other direction. This movie went overboard trying to make a social message.","true":true}
