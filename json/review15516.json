Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Seriously I am confused why so many people are freaking out?? I wasn\u2019t to keen on the Luke Story but I understand why they did it. They want the new characters to shine and not cling to the older movies. Spoiler Alert: is Luke really gone?? Apparently force ghost can have physical contact with living beings now... think about that... \ud83d\ude09","true":true}
