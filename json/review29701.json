Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took some risks\\, which was a refreshing move for a massive blockbuster like Star Wars.  There were a couple excellent action sequences\\, but there were also some elements that fell flat for me (Leia scenes and the full conversations Rey and Ben had).  Overall a solid blockbuster flick\\, but had potential to be much better.","true":true}
