{"101487":170129,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi - I don't know if critics are afraid of committing career suicide\\, if they are selling out\\, or if they actually freaking enjoyed this movie; but holy crap did I go into this movie expecting amazing empire strikes back quality and ended up crushed by how bad I thought it was.  I don't do reviews\\, and I certainly don't care whether people agree with me or not\\, but I feel like this movie is being reviewed dishonestly\\, so here is my no holds barred informal honest review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi.***SPOILERS AHEAD***SPOILERS AHEAD***SPOILERS AHEAD***SPOILERS AHEAD***SPOILERS AHEAD***\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi - Chalk full of cringe\\, humor is completely out of place most of the time\\, movie does not take itself seriously\\, characters die that shouldn't be dead\\, characters that should die are not dead\\, all of the setup from episode VII that JJ Abrams did is completely crapped on by this movie\\, and all of the story decisions and missed opportunities seem like they were made all for the sake of being unpredictable.  THE MOVIE IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! IT IS UNPREDICTABLE BECAUSE NOBODY COULD HAVE PREDICTED HOW UTTERLY GARBAGE THIS WOULD TURN OUT!  The movie ends with the feeling that it has rebooted the trilogy again.\\nCharacters:\\nLoved Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo - Don't have much to go off\\, but she has the most epic scene in the entire movie.\\nThe only character I felt any emotion about and epic moment in the entire movie that was not ruined by some bad cringe line or being yanked out of commitment.  This scene was freaking epic.  Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo performed a Light speed nuclear line drive right to the new orders face.  High octane middle finger of destruction.  Loved it.  The funniest part about me loving this character is that I didn't know much about her.  Introduced and killed all in the same movie without many scenes.\\nHated Luke - Portrayed incorrectly\\, constantly had to deliver cringe\\, and he's already dead\/ascended.\\nLuke was portrayed completely incorrectly.  Everything that he was at the end of return of the jedi was completely trashed\\, and he isn't even the same person.  I understand that he is supposed to be broken after (after! That means Luke should have been normal at this point) what Kylo did\\, but the REASON WHY KYLO 'broke luke' IS LUKES OWN DANG FAULT.  HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FINE AND NORMAL BEFORE THAT.  Luke Skywalker at the end of return of the jedi is supposed to be the immovable object when it comes to being corruptible.  He stood in the face of his father (twice) and the emperor and still was unable to be corrupted by the dark side\\, and you're telling me that for a glimpse of a moment he would raise a lightsaber towards a student\\, let alone his own nephew\\, out of fear of the dark side?!?!?!?!  He is supposed to be the most powerful force wielder in the entire galaxy at this point\\, maybe not in regards to Snoke because we don't even know who the heck Snoke is\\, and is referred to as a legend multiple times throughout this movie.  If Luke was not afraid enough of the emperor or his father than he wouldn't bat an eye at the dark side in Kylo and he would try everything in his power to help Kylo deal with it because he's honestly the best person to help Kylo in that situation.\\n\\nHated Leia - Missed opportunity on epic scene\\, should be dead\\, but is still alive.\\nHad epic death scene moment ruined by flying through space like Mary Poppins\\, and shes still alive.  WTF!?!?!?!?  SHE IS THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT SHOULD BE 1000% DEAD BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A CGI TRAIN WRECK FOR THE NEXT MOVIE.  It would have been perfect for them to end her by having Kylo not being able to pull the trigger (possible redemption)\\, his squad kills her\\, and she dies in space.  Nah instead let's have her use the force to fly through space\\, and instead of her being knocked unconscious by the gigantic blast that killed everyone but her\\, she'll knock the frick out after she's saved herself because she's had a rough time. WTF!?!?!?!?!\\n\\nHated Rey - Had a lot of setup and potential from episode VII\\, and all potential back story opportunities were trashed. \\nRey had so much mystery surrounding her about where she came from. What were the visions she was having? Who were her parents\/why couldn't she remember her childhood well? Why was Luke's lightsaber calling to her?  This was all thrown out the door for a twilight 'say it' moment that feels like it was a school yard bully speaking on a kindergarten playground 'haha your parents didn't love you\\, haha they were junker nobodies just selling you\\, haha that makes you a nobody\\, but I care about you Rey...NOW JOIN ME AND WE'LL RULE THE GALAXY AS KYLO AND NOBODY.'  WHAT IN THE FLYING HEAVENS WERE THE WRITERS THINKING!?\\nLoved\/Hated Kylo - Bad lines\\, cringe\\, and no consistency.\\nI love Adam Driver as an actor.  I would have nobody else for Kylo Ren.  Adam had to constantly deliver the most ridiculous written lines that will make you cringe\\, his character is all over the place with his morals\\, and all things being said I think Adam did the best job possible for such a crap shoot.\\nHated Captain Phasma - Missed opportunity. Possibly dead.\\nBarely any screen time\\, missed opportunity\\, and possibly trashed by possibly being dead already. Feels like Boba Fett in ROTJ.  That's all I have to say about Phasma.  Feelsbadman.\\nHated Snoke - Missed opportunity. Already dead.\\nThere were a million fan theories about Snoke\\, good setup from episode VII\\, and the opportunity was completely missed and trashed by already being killed in the most underwhelming way possible.\\nHated Finn - Epic moment ruined\\, and nearly all his scenes were boring.\\nFinn should be dead\\, one of the only epic moments in the movie was completely ruined by being quite literally yanked out of the moment\\, and he is still cringe throughout the entire movie\\, but his character is supposed to be cringe so that's ok.\\nHow I think it should have gone: \\nThe movie should have left us in suspense\\, hopelessness\\, and looking very bleak for our heroes by the end.  It could have left us on some crazy cliff hanger like: Rey and Kylo both turning dark\\, there is no clear hero to challenge them\\, and the resistance is nearly decimated.  OR: Snoke breaks Rey and brainwashes\/turns her dark\\, betrays Kylo and tells Rey to kill him\\, Kylo barely escapes with his life\\, returns to Luke to finish his training\\, and ultimately there is a fall for Rey and redemption for Kylo. OR: Rey redeems Kylo\\, they barely escape with their lives\\, and Snoke takes over as the main villain. This movie ultimately had a boring start\\, mediocre middle\\, and entertaining end that is completely ruined multiple times over.  This movie just felt like it took all the setup from Episode VII and crapped all over it.\\nLast thoughts:\\nI now understand why Mark Hamill hates this movie.  I cannot believe that people are with an honest opinion comparing this movie to Empire Strikes Back. Some are even calling it the best Star Wars movie yet.  This is a children's movie at best\\, and before anyone comes at me with the argument\\, 'bruh it's supposed to be made for kids\\,' that is utter bull crap.  Star Wars has always been an adult's movie that is appropriate enough for the entire family to enjoy.  Never has it been completely intended only for children. Most of the original audience is of the age 40+.\\nAlright my vent is over.  I hated this movie.  This is my least favorite Star Wars of all time.","true":true}
