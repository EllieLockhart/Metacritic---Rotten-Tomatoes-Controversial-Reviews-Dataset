Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"finally got a chance to see it and I'm a bit disappointed...but didn't leave the theater entirely dissatisfied with the movie. I think it's a pretty good movie...but it feels like they missed out on so many opportunities on so many better things they could of done. instead of forcing a love story between Rose and Finn that was completely out of no where. why couldn't they just cut that and add more or longer lightsaber battles or something... it's probably one of the most conflicted star wars movies I ever seen..it's like trying to be too many things at once but it's not necessarily bad at doing all those things.. it's just not great either..there are some good moments but those moments feel watered down cause of the just ok or unnecessary moments...2 and half stars is the best I can give it ... just cause half of the movie is good and the other half can be cut out and the main story won't miss a beat...Finn's story went on for too long\\, and Poe was made to look like a idiot..when could of just told him what was going on and half of the shitty parts of the movie could of been avoided and we probably would of had better details from the main story..like who the hell is snoke etc..","true":true}
