Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most disrespectful & careless Star Wars film ever made. Rian Johnson took a crap all over everything that Luke Skywalker has represented for decades. There was no continuity between this & The Force Awakens. They explained nothing about the proragonist or antagonist. We learn nothing from this movie. It's all political agenda & feminist propoganda. Looked okay visually\\, that's the only positive.","true":true}
