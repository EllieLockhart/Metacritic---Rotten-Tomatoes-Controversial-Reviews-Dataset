Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie delivers one of the biggest \\\"wtf\\\"-moments you'll see in your life in theaters\\, and has delightful performances by Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill and so many more of the cast.\\nSome characters die before you really get to know them\\, which feels a bit like a shame but which is what the extended universe is for I guess. Finn's entire storyline does feel exactly the same as it was in TFA\\, which is a shame and the worst bit of the movie for me. They could have been more original in that regard.\\nJohnson made some decisions I wouldn't have made in writing and shooting the movie\\, but all in all it is a great movie\\, with its heart in the right place\\, and which might leave people a bit depressed at the end of it.\\n\\nThe lesson of this movie is failure\\, but I look forward to how much higher these characters will be able to soar in the last chapter of this trilogy.\\n\\nThe creature designs were amazing and used at the appropriate times to bring some lightheartedness into an otherwise very dark movie.","true":true}
