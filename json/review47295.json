Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a thrilling ride from beginning to end! By far my favorite of the recent movies. If you're still deciding if you want to see it\\, I implore you to ignore the butt hurt comments of disappointed fanboys. They had incorrect assumptions about the way the story would go\\, and they paid for it. It was fantastically done\\, and extremely entertaining. Rian Johnson has left large shoes to fill!","true":true}
