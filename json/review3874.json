Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bluntly funny and entertaining\\, packed with action and drama though lacking in the story department as well as believability of both character development and grand scale conflict","true":true}
