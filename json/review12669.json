Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider this a terrible follow up to The Force Awakens\\, a film I truly enjoyed.  It's a decent watch\\, acting and action wise.  The problems I have w\/ the movie are all story elements.  So many things were started in The Force Awakens and were completely abandoned by the new director.  Also the way Luke Skywalker was handled.  I feel like they really didn't do the character justice at all.  In a sense they pretty much tried to ruin him.","true":true}
