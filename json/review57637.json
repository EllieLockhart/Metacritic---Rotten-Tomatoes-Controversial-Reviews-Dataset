Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many unimportant characters\\, no questions answered\\, out of character Luke whose character they destroyed\\, what was the point of Snoke\\, too many porgs with forced humor\\, unimportant casino planet with cat leapord things\\, d-d-d-dj\\, force projection\\, super woman Leia\\, shirtless Kylo\\, so many things done wrong and generally a big disappointment after the ep7. buildup","true":true}
