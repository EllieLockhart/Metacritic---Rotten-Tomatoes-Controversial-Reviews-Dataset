{"101487":160475,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the reasons I enjoyed last year's franchise offshoot 'Rogue One' so much was its ability to faithfully recreate the look and feel of the original trilogy within the context of a grittier\\, 'Dirty Dozen' style war film. It delivered all the familiar trappings we crave from a Star Wars movie while boldly experimenting with the decades-old mythology. For all of its whiz-bang delights\\, 2015's 'The Force Awakens' hasn't aged nearly as well; in his efforts to satiate nostalgia-hungry fans still smarting from George Lucas' oft-maligned prequels\\, director J.J. Abrams borrowed so liberally from 'A New Hope' that it almost qualifies as a remake. With a gaggle of future Star Wars movies already in the Disney pipeline\\, the stark contrast between these two films underscores the need to explore new ways of interpreting the legacy of this beloved franchise for diehard fans and future audiences alike. \\n\\nIn assuming the creative reins for this latest instalment\\, Rian Johnson appears to have taken these concerns to heart\\, because for better or worse STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is on a mission to defy your expectations. The final scene of 'The Force Awakens' featured Force-sensitive scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) silently confronting a reclusive\\, haggard-looking Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)\\, so it's no spoiler to point out that much of this chapter revolves around her quest to both enlist the disgraced Jedi's aid with the Resistance and learn about her newly-discovered powers. Their often contentious interactions\\, as well as their shared connection to an increasingly unhinged Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) provide the film's emotional heart and directly mirror Luke's own personal journey from the original trilogy. At first\\, we're led to believe that Johnson has repeated the previous episode's missteps and sabotaged his own movie for the sake of fan service. Thankfully\\, Johnson's smarter than that - obvious callbacks to 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return Of The Jedi' abound throughout the film\\, only to have it pull the rug out from under us with jaw-dropping curve balls. Some are done for dramatic effect\\, hurling the story down a different path altogether\\, while a few of them are staged purely for comedic effect.\\n\\nThat's right: 'The Last Jedi' is a genuinely funny movie (arguably a franchise first). Perhaps to compensate for the darker narrative turn this middle chapter inevitably takes\\, Johnson peppers the first half of this rollicking 153-minute extravaganza with gags aplenty\\, a controversial stylistic choice that's already generating heated online debate amongst SW fans. [Personally\\, I enjoyed these lighter moments even if a couple of them steer dangerously close to 'Spaceballs' style slapstick.] Which is not to suggest that the movie is somehow lacking in dramatic tension; picking up the story immediately where the prior instalment left off\\, much of the film is devoted to the First Order's dogged pursuit of a shattered Resistance fleet desperately trying to evade capture. It's a gripping slow-motion game of cat-and-mouse played out in the ominous vacuum of space that manages to sustain our interest far longer than it logically should\\, eventually leading to a climactic ground assault on the salt-covered desert plains of Crait\\, all brought to vivid life thanks to the film's breathtaking cinematography and John Williams' rousing musical score. \\n\\nThe overstuffed cast (which includes franchise newbies like Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro) is an embarrassment of riches that the film occasionally struggles to fully exploit. A few fan-favourite characters get frustratingly short shrift here\\, while others like Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac\\, criminally underused in 'The Force Awakens') are allowed to flourish in expanded roles. In light of her untimely passing a year ago\\, Carrie Fisher's final appearance as Resistance leader Leia Organa is profoundly bittersweet; still reeling from the recent death of estranged hubby Han Solo and carrying the weight of an entire Rebel army on her stalwart shoulders\\, we find the embattled Leia struggling to justify the many personal sacrifices she's made for the cause - it's a quietly devastating performance befitting both the iconic former Princess and the incomparable Fisher herself.\\n\\nFollowing his agonizingly brief cameo two years ago\\, Hamill's return as Luke Skywalker is a decidedly more joyous affair\\, one that supplies several of the movie's most satisfying laughs. Being so closely associated with this one role for the past four decades\\, it's easy to overlook the veteran actor's long and diverse r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and be pleasantly surprised by his lightness of touch in some of the movie's sunnier moments. Like his twin sister\\, though\\, this older incarnation of the legendary Jedi knight also finds himself haunted by his own life choices; blaming himself for losing nephew Ben Solo to the Dark Side (thereby giving birth to First Order henchman Kylo Ren)\\, Skywalker balks at Rey's desire to have him teach her the ways of the Force\\, vowing to let the failings of the Jedi Order die with him and wholly rejecting his own legacy as the galaxy's last\\, best hope for peace.\\n\\nCarrying the weight of one's own legacy is a theme that runs throughout the entire film\\, and its writer\/director clearly relishes the opportunity to let his players work out their inner demons in broad daylight. As Rey tries desperately to piece together the fragments of her ancestry\\, Kylo Ren violently pushes back against his own\\, literally bashing his Vader-like helmet into rubble after Supreme Leader Snokes taunts him for his recent failures. Most fascinating of all is the movie's stark reassessment of the Jedi Order: an embittered Luke argues\\, rather convincingly\\, how its myopic view of the universe enabled a single Dark Lord to dissolve the Galactic Senate and impose martial law across the galaxy right under their noses\\, all but vanquishing their numbers in the process. One could be forgiven for interpreting this sober second look at the Force and the Jedi Order as an open rebuke of organized religion and how one's core belief in a higher power can be perverted into a rigid\\, ritualistic belief system that eventually strays too far from its origins. [If nothing else\\, this philosophical debate inspires one of the movie's most jaw-dropping surprises\\, a goosebump-inducing highlight far too good to spoil here - suffice it to say\\, it offers an effective counter-argument in the Jedi debate.]\\n\\nWhich brings us back to Johnson himself\\, who seems to be waging his own private war against the legacy of Hollywood's most beloved franchise. The original Star Wars films are so deeply embedded in modern pop culture that even people who've never watched them can quote some of their most famous catchphrases. How do you pay homage to these cultural touchstones and their rabid fanbase without allowing the saga to become rote and predictable? You take chances\\, and thankfully Johnson does just that with 'The Last Jedi'. It's a wildly ambitious entry in the series that captures the swashbuckling spirit of the older films and deepens the already-rich mythology without spilling all the beans...gotta save some surprises for Episode IX\\, right?\\n\\nBut will you like it? Sweet Jesus...who can say? A few of Johnson's aforementioned artistic choices will no doubt rankle some among you. And look\\, I'm not claiming it's a perfect movie. While the overall pacing keeps this plus-sized epic humming nicely throughout\\, some of the first act's intercutting could use a little tidying up. There's a plot hole or two (not exactly a franchise first)\\, and some may cry foul at its unwillingness to tie up every loose end. More significantly\\, I can't help second-guessing its blatant use of callbacks to the original trilogy - yes\\, they're mostly employed in the service of plot twists that will delight fans in the moment\\, but might they feel increasingly lazy with repeated viewings? Time will tell.\\n\\nWarts and all\\, though\\, I do know this much: I walked out of that opening night screening overcome with that sweet\\, intoxicating wooziness that I come to expect from a new Star Wars movie\\, the same rush I felt a year ago with 'Rogue One'.\\n\\nThat's a very good sign indeed.","true":true}
