Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will not purchase a digital\/physical copy of this crime against Star Wars. Rian Johnson should be prevented from having anything to do with this franchise.  There are not words to adequately describe how truly and completely awful the writing for this movie was - his 'vision' for this movie is more of a hellish nightmare for true Star Wars fans.  I had very high hopes that Disney would put their best foot forward with the franchise - with this installment they have fallen flat on their face.  I honestly didn't think it was possible to make a completely craptastic Star Wars movie\\, Rian Johnson proved me wrong ... the Last Jedi was so bad that a cameo by Jar-Jar Binks would have made it better ... Rian Johnson should consider buying a chipper shredder and making his only possible positive contribution to the planet - as fertilizer.","true":true}
