Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took all of Luke's growth as a jedi we saw in the original trilogy and tossed it over its shoulder down a cliff. Rian Johnson seems to be saying through emo villain Kylo Ren what he was thinking that caused him to excrete this vile feces out all over everything that was Star Wars: \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" But\\, Rian\\, you didn't have to. You had a choice. You chose poorly.","true":true}
