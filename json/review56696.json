Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie did impress me. The CGI was good\\, the framework was well done\\, Adam Driver was incredible\\, but the one thing that kept me awake was all the shocking surprises. I understand that people who has been Star Wars fans through their hole lives don't appreciate this as much as the others\\, but for me\\, this was almost perfect.","true":true}
