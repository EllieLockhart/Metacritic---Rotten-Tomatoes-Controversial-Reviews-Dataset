Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every reveal was disappointing. Snoke supposedly a powerful bad guy done in 2 mins with no explanation.  Rey's parents are nobody so her having super force powers\/light saber fighting skills without training is not explained. The whole Finn\/Rose\/Casino\/Code breaker story line was pointless as it added nothing to the plot or story(except Harry Potter and his broom). Luke's story was fine on the island planet but\\, the \\\"most power Jedi left\\\" doesn't care enough to leave or care about his green light saber or his father's light saber. And then he force ghosts. Leaving the reveal that he came to the salt planet to fight Kylo disappointing. I did not see a light saber dual or Luke or Snoke's full potential. \\nPositives? Kylo was better character wise. I liked Rose's character (not plot). Chewie and the Porgs where funny","true":true}
