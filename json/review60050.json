We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I honestly don\u2019t get the negativity behind this game\\, I\u2019ve just finished playing and honestly\\, I cried many manly tears. When Joel died the way he did I was angry\\, sad and just confused\\, I didn\u2019t know how to react and seeing Ellie just as this broken girl trying to grieve the passing of the only father figure she had in her life was truly heartbreaking to watch and play through.\r\rThe character development in this game is amazing because I went from hating Abby and the rest of the members of the knockoff Fireflies to actually liking them and hating the fact that they died\\, it\u2019s safe to say playing this game is probably what it feels to have Bipolar\\, one minute I\u2019m sad\\, one minute I\u2019m happy and the next I\u2019m pissed off by something that\u2019s happened.\r\rI almost lobbed my controller when Abby shot Tommy\\, I honestly thought she killed him\\, and I wasn\u2019t ready for that to happen\\, not quite yet anyways.\r\rI want to talk about the ending as that\u2019s where people seem to be annoyed about the most which honestly I can kind of understand but the way I look at it is this\\, Ellie has lost everything\\, she has lost friends\\, she has lost her family\\, she has lost everything and now she is alone\\, I feel like she realised that she related to Abby at that moment when she was drowning her at sea and it was at that point Ellie simply\\, gave up. She saw that she would be no better than Abby in that situation\\, and I honestly love that ending\\, I would love to be able to play as Abby again if there is a third game which I honestly hope that\u2019s there is. They left the game on a (somewhat) cliffhanger\\, Ellie arrives back home to find out that Dina has up and left with little baby JJ. I want to know what happens next and I hope I don\u2019t have to wait 7 years to find out!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
