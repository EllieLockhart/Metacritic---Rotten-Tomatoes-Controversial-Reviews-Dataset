Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, easily\\,30 minutes too long. I feel bad saying this but Carrie Fischer was bad in this episode and unnecessary. To date the new versions have never touched the originals. Mainly\\, because I loved the original cast in their heyday and the movie was so fresh and unique. I do like the new cast members so\\, cut the chord with the way past prime\\, leftover old cast! I'll keep going but looking forward to no more old cast and hopefully\\, way better\\, editing!","true":true}
