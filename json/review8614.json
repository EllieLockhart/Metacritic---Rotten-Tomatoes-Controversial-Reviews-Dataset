Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First review on here but had to sign up to register my frustration\\, borderline anger with how bad the film was. Indeed there were some amazing visuals and proper 'Star Wars goose bump moments'\\, such as the fight in the chamber and the part where Luke emerges to fight at the end (before you realise he's not really there) but so many trash points\\, some of which were just crass. The milk scene you just have to wonder what the thinking was behind that. It jarred and served no purpose other than for controversy. Flying Leia. The lame excess of the Finn waking up scene and the fluid spurting out. The moralising of greed at the casino (ironically coming from a megalomaniacal company such as Disney); the forced representation of races and the inter racial kiss\\, again for the sake of controversy (or agenda setting) rather than for narrative reasons\\, the weird contrived twist of the lady with the purple hair. Watching it I felt like I was being preached to and you don't pay good money for that. I think the worst thing about it is the opportunity missed and the potential wasted. Star Wars with the core characters from the original trilogy\\, overlapping with new characters\\, so much excitement just in that\\, but in the end just some guff\\, drifting middle episode that completely sours the appetite for the next film. It'll take a miracle to save the next one.","true":true}
