Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total middle finger to dedicated fans of the original films. The plot was incoherent\\, characters that were hyped up from the previous film were killed off for no reason\\, the overuse of childish humour\\, which makes it seem the film doesnt take itself seriously and of course Leia surviving being blasted into space. Shambles of a film\\, and I didnt even go into it with high expectations.","true":true}
