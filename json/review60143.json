Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Despite the leaks\\, I went into this game with an open mind. What I found is that The Last of Us Part 2 will be a game that I will remember because of its impact on me. I think about it all the time\\, I can't stop! Very few games stick with me after getting through the credits but this game has rewritten what a videogame and a story can be. Playing through this there were moments like Ellie's cover of 'Take on me' and the ending fight between Abby and Ellie that were some of the greatest moments I have ever experienced in a videogame. This game tells a story of revenge\\, Abby's revenge story shows the effects as she loses everyone close to her while you see Ellie directly go through it during the game. The game to me is about breaking this cycle and truly finding a purpose\\, that was the true goal that was achieved in the end. While I can't directly express my thoughts into words I just want to share my experience and while it wasn't perfect I can happily say it was a game I won't forget but rather a memory I hope will never fade.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
