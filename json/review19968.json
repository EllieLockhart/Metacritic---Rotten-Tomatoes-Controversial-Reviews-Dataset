Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good but don't know why everyone saying it's the best one. Way too many holes and doing things for no reason without any back story of how anything came to be and leaving no direction in the future. Great acting\\, cast and cinematography but I'm underwhelmed. Disappointed that I'm disappointed.","true":true}
