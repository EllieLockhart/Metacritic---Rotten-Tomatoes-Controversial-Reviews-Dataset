Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worse Star Wars movie ever. Disappointing in every aspect save for the soundtrack and the photography. The plot is ridiculous\\, filled with holes and an obvious feminism agenda. Disney is destroying Star Wars. I'm not going to see Episode 9. I cannot\\, for the life of me\\, understand how this movie is getting 92% rating in Rottentomatoes. How much money did you guys receive from Disney to give such a flawed movie those ratings? I actually thought that J.J. Abrams is the worst thing that could ever happen to the Star Wars franchise\\, but no... Rian Johnson is. Poor George Lucas... Kathleen Kennedy is destroying his baby. I hate this film. I hate Snoke\\, Rose\\, the Codechanger or something\\, Finn and the Purple-haired\\, emasculating admiral or whatever. This is such a cheap screenplay. Such a cop out movie. I can't even write about what they did to Luke Skywalker because I don't want to get another stomachache. Feminism is destroying Star Wars. To all STAR WARS FANS\\, don't allow this!!! Don't buy the movie on blu-ray or dvd or anything... Don't watch Episode 9. Don't let Disney get away with this.","true":true}
