I completed the game on Hard mode recently\\, and I thought about it for a couple of days.\r\rThe parts of the game where it truly shines are gameplay\\, graphics\\, music\\, and voice acting. While the story was engaging\\, there is some room for improvement.\r\rI found the gameplay to be fun and tense with very limited resources\\, and more thrilling as the game progressed. The dodge mechanic is one of the best additions to movement. Infected are much more aggressive and dangerous\\, and the human enemies are much smarter at spotting and flanking you (at least on the harder difficulties). Stealth feels very rewarding as a result. Exploration feels more organic as the environments are much larger than the first game. A standalone Factions mode using these gameplay mechanics has a lot of potential\\, as I rarely grew bored of it.\r\rGraphics are phenomenal. This is hands-down one of the best looking games on PS4. It's sometimes hard to look at some of the kills in this game because the brutality is on full display with these graphics.\r\rThe music is mainly used in the background to build tension\\, and it perfectly matches the dark tone of the game.\r\rVoice acting is top-notch as to be expected with every Naughty Dog game.\r\rWhile I thought the story was good in world building and asking difficult questions when it comes to the themes of vengeance\\, the game could have been better crafted with regard to the pacing. I found it difficult to feel the type of emotion the first game was able to pull from me due to the weird structure or order of the story (you'll know what I mean if you've played it). At one point\\, I felt that I had to force myself to finish the game early just to see how earlier scenes play out. This was a little frustrating.\r\rAnother aspect that will turn some players (not all players) off is the SJW politics present in the game. While the story does pass over these moments quickly and they do not really draw away from the character development\\, it sometimes take me out of the moment (mainly some cringe a little in the early game).\r\rOverall\\, the game has fun gameplay with a story that\\, while does not live up to the story of the first game\\, is above average and worth playing for yourself.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
