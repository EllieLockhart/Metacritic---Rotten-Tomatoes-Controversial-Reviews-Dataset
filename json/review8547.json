Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"first\\, i want to say that I loved EVERY single star wars movie.... except for this one :(\\nsure\\, there is awesome imagery\\, and some good action\\, but it just kinda feel out of star wars soul.\\n-There is serious pace issues at the point wich i got bored.\\n-Someone's resurection was just outrageous and hilarious\\, ruined the moment\\, and character was totally useless from then.\\n-Total arc with finn and fangirl number 207 completly useless and flat.\\n-Puppet was better rendered in 1983\\n-Anti climatic death of an hyper intriguing vilain.\\n+some good jokes\\n+Unexpected scenario\\n--- \\\" love will defeat the  first order \\\" :'(\\n+ many many short tributes to episodes 5 and 6","true":true}
