Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't quite understand why nerds bash this one as if its the worst SW movies ever made (it's not...some of the prequels easily win that ignominy) -- and let's face it\\, if you view the first 3\\, every movie after it is based on some central light vs. dark and mini-plots of ancillary characters\\, whether its Han Solo's adventures in the first two or Finn & Rose (in this one). Formulaic? yeah\\, but we still enjoy it & this one brought it home for me since its the last we will see of Lea and Luke triumphantly sign off & peace out (sad!) -- whats more interesting now is how the new generation will pick up the legacy and keep us excited!","true":true}
