Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally awful movie that plays out like talentless fan fiction. Worse is the constant\\, \\\"fansplaining\\\" by pathetic fanboys\\,  that won't have a bad thing said about Starwars\\, who have to constantly defend the numerous poor scenes rather than point out ANYTHING about the movie that makes it good. Also there's an awful character in the movie\\, an ugly woman with a HUGE nose\\, that has somehow wangled a speaking role and constantly pops up talking when she needn't! She only adds to the crapness of the Casino planet and Princess Leia flying about in space\\, boring slooooow two hour space chase until one of the ships runs out of fuel\\, Rey and Kylo Skype sessions\\, Captain Phasma turning up when she may as well be dead after the first movie just so she can die in this one after popping up for no reason whatsoever...","true":true}
