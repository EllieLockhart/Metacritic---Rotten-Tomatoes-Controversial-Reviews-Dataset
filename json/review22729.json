Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Listen to Kylo Ren \\\"just let it go\\, let it all go\\, jedi\\, sith and everything\\\"  \\nWhat Lucas gave us was the same thing except now we have expectations.  \\\"It is not going where you think it is\\\"\\, so let go.   As a semi hardcore fan who wanted to see more Jedi myths\\, I left a bit disappointed.  However\\, as a star wars movie which follows Lucas original ideology\\, it does justice.  It is a Skywalker saga\\, the redemption of skywalker.  Rey to Ben solo is like what Snoke is to Kylo Ren.  I enjoyed it.","true":true}
