Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film finally gives the prequel movies competition for the Worst Star Wars film of the franchise\\, and it's all thanks to a pointless\\, inconsequential plot\\, piss-poor character development\\, and \\\"shocking twists\\\" thrown in for the sake of subverting expectations that were built up from the previous film. This is a directionless\\, sub-par mess of a film which only shows how nauseating the Disney ride is going to get\\, and we better drink the kool-aid and buy our Porg toys and shut up\\, because the critics mysteriously all agree\\, it's the film of the year.","true":true}
