Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, but left me feeling as if there was no movie ahead\\, and left me unconvinced of some of the outcomes. Rey's revelations felt boring\\, if they are true\\, and the interaction with Snoke was less than convincing.  Palpetine's interactions as an emperor were more convincing.  I feel as if the plot line moved an inch\\, rather than a mile.\\n\\nVisually spectacular of course\\, though some of the battle scenes were not convincing.  Perhaps this is what happens when someone else directs the movie.","true":true}
