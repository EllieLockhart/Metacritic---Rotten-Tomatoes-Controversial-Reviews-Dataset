You're forced in the first hour of the game to see one of the beloved main characters from the first game die to the villain (who's sexual orientation for me didn't matter but the way they were written did). Then it becomes a revenge story with Ellie but the catch is that the characters around her are forgettable and barely passable for a game of the last of us part 2's expected calibur. The voice acting and motion capture was solid but that's the best I can do. You're then going to end the game poorly with not even killing the character the goal is to get revenge for. The game is full of plot whole also Gameplay is the same as the last game in the most par and I will not review it high for it. It is clunky sometimes in it's ai much like older games. The graphics are phenomenal but we expected them to be.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
