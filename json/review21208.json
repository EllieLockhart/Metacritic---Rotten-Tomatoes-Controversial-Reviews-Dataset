Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the entire Star Wars series for the first time and it is truly incredible up until this movie. I just wish they stuck to the storyline instead of adding so much unnecessary content and excessive plot twists; it was actually annoying and difficult to finish. The best part of \\nthe film would have been the original characters but the writers found a way to absolutely destroy them. What they did to Luke Skywalker was shameful. Watching this was similar to watching the last episode of Game of Throwns - Unsettling and disappointing. I wish I never watched it.","true":true}
