Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The theme of this film seems to be failure and disappointment from the perspective of the \\\"heroes\\\"\\, which makes sense as the second act of a trilogy. However.....Rian Johnson apparently thought that the audience needed to feel the disappointment and failure as well. SO many missed opportunities and illogical plot points in this film. I don't know if the RT critics were paid off or are willfully blind to this film's excessive number of flaws\\, but the audience score is telling. This might be the worst SW film yet...I hope JJ can salvage the trilogy with Eps. 9\\, but I don't have hope. No excitement to see the conclusion of this story. Disney\\, do better.","true":true}
