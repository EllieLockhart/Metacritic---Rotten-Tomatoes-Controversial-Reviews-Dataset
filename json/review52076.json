Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Although we never want to lose any of our hero\u2019s\\, what we gained and what it means for the future is huge. No longer is it blood that ties the force. Anyone can have it pumping through their veins\\, as is shown at the end. Hence\\, we are given a hint and we see our new arch nemesis is definitely bat-nuts crazy. Rey is strong\\, thank heavens\\, but is left rattled with the onslaught of the losses. Princess Leia is a focal point throughout. With all of that\\, still you can see the possibilities.
