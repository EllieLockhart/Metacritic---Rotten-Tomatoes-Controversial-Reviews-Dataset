Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie if you have Alzheimers and like flashy lights. Seriously the worst Star Wars movie ever. I would pay a lot of money to have my memory wiped of this bantha fodder. I really enjoyed the force awakens but this just ruined it for me. What happen to the plot? Feels like they made the choices they did for the sake of doing the unexpected.  I have no desire to see episode 9. Star Wars is dead and you can thank Disney.","true":true}
