{"101487":139383,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really want to love this movie\\, I really do.. I'm going to preface this with I enjoy every star wars movie for what it is\\, not a prequel hater\\, not a supreme lover of the originals. This will also have some spoilers so beware Positives: effects are amazing\\, overall ride is enjoyable\\, new direction that is fulfilling\\, Kylo Ren development is great\\, some good comical scenes\\, BB8 shines The rest will harp on negatives. The new direction is also it's downfall. I get it\\, anyone can be a hero\\, but to answer the dying questions from episode 7 with the trolling vibe they did is not right..namely with Snoke. I get Rey is force sensitive but she is entirely too overpowered with no training and little guidance but is now a Jedi? Too many Marvel type puns in the movie that's not needed. The whole code breaker story is just filler. Kind of a big defamation of Luke Skywalker\\, although I did like some of the new direction. The whole fuel issue being a plot mover is not really that good. At last but not least...NO LIGHT SABER DUEL. Even in the force awakens there was one\\, which is honestly the biggest highlights of any star wars film. What's worse is they tease one..to no avail Overall the movie was enjoyable but honestly a bit of a letdown\\, mostly in writing. Kylo Ren's development as a antivillian is one of the highlights of the movie and series. Episode 9 needs to do a lot\\, imo\\, to not only makeup the whole but end the trilogy on a good note","true":true}
