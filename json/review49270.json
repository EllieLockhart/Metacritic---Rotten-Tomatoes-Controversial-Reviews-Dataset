Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie of all time. Ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. Story was extremely horribly written and didn\u2019t make sense. I saw this movie twice because every critic said that the second viewing makes it \u201csooo much better.\u201d Not the case. Second viewing made it worse. Star Wars ended with Episode 6.
