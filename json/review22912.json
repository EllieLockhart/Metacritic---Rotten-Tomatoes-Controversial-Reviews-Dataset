Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looks beautiful in some scenes and thats about all I liked. The finn and rose sub plot was just ultimately boring and not needed. Their kiss was absolutely cringe worthy. The entire movie is one elongated chase scene. So many sub plots from TFA are just dropped with no explanation. Instead of enjoying a star wars movie I left feeling frustrated and wonder where the hell do we go from here?","true":true}
