Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like a string of beautiful but mismatched beads can make a hideous necklace\\, this movie was composed of funny moments\\, incredible action\\, inspiring speeches that should never have been strung together as they were. Daisy\\, Mark\\, and John have all expressed concern in interviews\\, and their fears turned out to be well-founded. As a life-long fan of the franchise\\, I left the theater so deeply frustrated that I was unable to sleep for several hours. From Kylo's classic abuse of Rey (\\\"I'm the only one who will ever care about you\\, you're worthless.\\\") to Finn's utter sidelining after being set up as the co-lead with Rey in The Force Awakens\\, to the seemingly racist pairings of Kylo with Rey and Finn with Rose\\, after heavily teasing a Finn\/Rey story in TFA\\, to introducing and killing off needless characters\\, to \\\"that's not how the force works!\\\" moments\\, to a costuming\\, hair\\, and makeup department I'd like to personally take out behind the woodshed\\, to an indescribably poor follow through with Snoke... There's just not much I can say for this movie. As a fan of the franchise\\, I know I would want to see it\\, so I won't tell people not to go\\, but honestly... I want my money back.","true":true}
