Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I always knew that Disney's purchase of the Star Wars franchise was inevitably going to ruin it. Luke's character assassination was unforgivable. Leia's Mary Poppins scene in space was a joke and low hanging fruit for youtube mockery. There's a SJW narrative that lingers throughout. The characters don't have the chemistry that the original trilogy did. Hollywood (and Disney by extension) seem more focused on selling toys\\, pushing the usual agendas\\, and questionable casting. Hollywood critics eat this up and go back for seconds. RIP Star Wars....","true":true}
