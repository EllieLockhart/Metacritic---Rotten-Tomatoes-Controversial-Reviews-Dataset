Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie. Some assholes will be disappointed because Rian Johnson didn't make what they wanted him to\\, but it was fresh and left a lot of questions for future films. People seem to forget it took a couple decades to get the \\\"prequels\\\" that added all the backstory to the old trilogy. This was the first one that made me feel like a kid watching a movie again. It was enjoyable!","true":true}
