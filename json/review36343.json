Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think about the movie\\, the more it's shifted from \\\"good\\\" to \\\"great\\\".  I don't want to spoil anything but the realization for me that the movie is about how people cope with failure and disillusionment took many scenes I initially saw as flaws and made them much more powerful (or at least understandable).  If nothing else\\, it's the first SW film I've ever had to process and discuss this much post-viewing to decide how I feel about it.","true":true}
