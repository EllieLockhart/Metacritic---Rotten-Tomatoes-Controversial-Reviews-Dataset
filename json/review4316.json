Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can I give \\\"Star Wars The Last Jedi\\\" zero stars? Because I would; really\\, the Critic consensus is nuts. I don't see how Star Wars TLJ doesn't completely ruin Star Wars for big fans of the story\/series. It certainly did for me; it managed to do what not even Episodes 1-3 could do. \\n\\nI worried when George Lucas sold Star Wars to Disney that the story itself would be the biggest loser. When Episode 7 came out\\, I was pleasantly surprised\\, even with the changes they went with. With Episode 8\\, all my fears were realized. They ruined Luke Skywalker\\, who was the eternal optimist and the character holes are unacceptable for a story with this much rich Canon and history. Thanks for ruining Star Wars\\, Disney. I don't see how I could bother seeing Episode 9 when it comes out. I'm going to pretend Star Wars stopped with Episode 6 and George Lucas.","true":true}
