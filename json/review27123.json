Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst films of the year. The few good seeds planted in the force awakens have completely been trashed here. there is nothing in this film that makes sense\\, the writing is awful. This whole new SW trilogy may be ok for little kids. but is is an insult to anyone who knows a little of the SW world.","true":true}
