Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So good.  When I see the 56% audience rating\\, my conspiracy theory bells go off.  I have yet to talk to anyone who hasn't LOVED it.\\n\\nAs for SW:TLJ\\, I can't begin to go express my love for the movie.  Great performances from the entire cast.  Maybe the most beautiful SW of the entire series.  Unlike SW:TFA\\, this is completely original with twists you do NOT see coming.  Please ignore the silly bad RT audience rating\\, the critics have this one right.  Go see it.","true":true}
