Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in this addition. It stole so many scenes from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that it leaves one wondering if there was more rehashed content than original. Sadly\\, it doesn't even improve on those original scenes\\, but rather simply replays them with more CGI and less actual tension or suspense.\\n\\nI would go into further issues with plot holes\\, missing backstories\\, and \\\"If they could do something like that\\, why have they never done that before?\\\" moments\\, but this movie just isn't worth the time to explain them all.\\n\\nThe popcorn is strong with this one.","true":true}
