Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked off the theater hugely disappointed: Luke Skywalker (WTF?) oscillates between cowardice and heroism in the space of minutes.\\nRey's training was a joke\\, Yoda appearance was lame at best. The main space battle? One ship trying to escape another\\, for 2 hours. Sub-plots and main villains? A mess. 1 star for the cinematography and 1 star for Benicio Del Toro\\, who made a great job with the few lines he got.","true":true}
