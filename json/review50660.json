Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"5 star for the visual\\, casting\\, acting\\, and sound.  -5 star for the worse-then-jar-jar dialogue\\, self-contradicting continuity and shallow bullet-point characterization.  I hope after all the greedy and political mofo milk this franchise to the bone and die\\, true star wars fans can take over and replace this garbage with the original canon.  Jaina Solo and Mara Jade are vastly superior female protagonist than the random op girl (forgot the name... that's how bad the character is. lol) that poor Daisy Ridley is stuck with.  Force Awaken was at least trying to create its own mythos...  this one completely trashes everything including Force Awaken's story while adding nothing.  Boycotting the last movie.","true":true}
