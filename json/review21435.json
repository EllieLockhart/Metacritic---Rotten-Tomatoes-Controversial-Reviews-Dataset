Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't dig in every single detail and nitpick everything I find silly in this movie. The main thing it has going for it are visual effects. The real problem with this movie is the writing. The jokes mostly fall flat\\, the character's reactions to events are odd. But don't take my word for it\\, Mark Hamill said ''I fundementaly disagree with virtually everything you've decided about my character'' to Rian Johnson. Hamill is an excellent actor who has played this role for decades. This to me\\, sums up the movie's writing.","true":true}
