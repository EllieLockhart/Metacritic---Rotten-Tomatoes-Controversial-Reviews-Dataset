Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot express in writing how disappointingly awful this sham was. The script was pitiful\\, the sub-plots were pointless\\, and the character development was non-existent. For all the kudos Rogue One managed to rescue for the franchise\\, The Last Jedi managed to destroy.\\n\\nI was afraid that The Last Jedi was going to be a massive let down - that was the only expectation it lived up to. Bad bad bad.\\n\\nI will not be rushing to even rent Episode IX.","true":true}
