Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've read more star wars books than most people have read books all together. This was a good movie. The wannabe directors claiming this doesn't feel like a star wars film must have missed Empire Strikes back. There's more humor than usual in this one\\, but it doesn't lead you to believe the situation is any less desperate. The action is constant and the various side plots look to be setting up the future of the series. A great film\\, but one you'll likely have to see a few times to keep up with the breakneck pace.","true":true}
