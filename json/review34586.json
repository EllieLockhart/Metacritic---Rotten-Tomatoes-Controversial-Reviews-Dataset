Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest problem with this movie is that everyone went with different expectations and ...demands. The questions pending from The Force Awakens are completely discarded. It does little to nothing to establish a status quo within it's universe\\, the Force is effectively a plot device rather than a mystery to be explored\\, the side plot is effectively pointless (which could potentially pay off in the next installment )and finally there are some baffling decisions concerning the fate of some of the characters.\\nWith all that said it's still an excellently directed\\, action packed\\, emotional roller coaster of a movie. It's easy to follow for younger audiences whose initiation to star wars was The Force Awakens.","true":true}
