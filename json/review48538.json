Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wont go into all the reasons why this film was so terrible\\, but mostly I just left the theatre really sad and depressed. I feel really bad for Mark Hamill\\, and what they did to Luke. Just a horrible ending for one of the most iconic characters of all time. What a major disappointment. This is just a movie full of \\\"gotcha\\\" moments.","true":true}
