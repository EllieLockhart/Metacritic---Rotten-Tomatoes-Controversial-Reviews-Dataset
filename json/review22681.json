{"101487":150001,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many people\\, especially of my generation (X)\\, I grew up on Star Wars. Robots\\, spaceships\\, aliens\\, and a kid raised on a farm who found magic and adventure\\, captured my imagination. I had the toys and books and made up new movies in my bedroom and with my friends. My fandom continued though the releases of the Special Editions and the prequel trilogy\\, all of which I enjoyed at first but came to see that it was just a waves of anticipation I was riding.\\n\\nThough I deeply loathed what he did with the Star Trek franchise\\, I was excited that J. J. Abrams was introducing a new trilogy. He was a lifelong fan\\, around my age\\, who understood the look and feel of Star Wars. When I heard about him bringing back location shoots and practical effects\\, I decided that even if the overall story was dumb\\, I was excited to have that old feeling again-one I hadn't felt since 1983.\\n\\nTo that end The Force Awakens didn't disappoint. The overall story was just a repeat of A New Hope\\, and most of the middle third was silly and pointless\\, but I loved the new characters\\, and the look and feel of the movie pushed every nostalgic button in me. I got what I wanted and thought Abrams did a competent job of establishing interesting new characters; a better storyteller had a great foundation to build upon.\\n\\nI thought Rogue One was a genuinely good movie. Having just seen Trump win the presidency and feeling dreadful about an authoritarian future\\, it was cathartic to see a scrappy band of guerrillas - mostly people of color led by a woman - strike a blow against a seemingly all powerful empire. I thought it was bold for a Disney film to have all the main characters die in the end. I also liked the democratization of the Force that I saw in RO; I felt like this was a part of a setup by Lucasfilm to break the mold of the \\\"choosen one\\\" hereditary-lineage narrative to open up new possibilities in the franchise.\\n\\nEnter The Last Jedi\\, I was genuinely excited for it. I hadn't seen Rian Johnson's other movies\\, but I heard good things about them and thought that he was set up to tell a great story. I looked forward to the \\\"dark second act\\\" vibe of The Empire Strikes Back (my favorite in the franchise) along with seeing much of the potential of TFA fulfilled. I had high hopes that the democratization of the Force would be expanded upon; Rey would NOT be of any lineage; Luke Skywalker would turn out to be not so good after all; the prequels (though unredeemable) could be salvaged by demonstrating the how the corruption and elitism of the Jedi order led to the rise of the Empire; Kylo\/Ben's internal conflict would lead to new and interesting developments; Finn's Stormtrooper past would develop into seeing the Stormtroopers as more than non-individual blaster-fodder; Snoke's backstory would tie loose threads from the previous seven movies; and Finn and Poe would act on the sexual tension (come on\\, it wasn't just me) between them.\\n\\nOn opening night I stood in line for an hour in the cold\\, sat through some of the worst trailers I've ever seen\\, and with popcorn in hand reacted with glee to those opening notes of the theme song. Then...within a half hour or so I had a sinking feeling. I didn't want to fully admit it to myself yet but\\, I couldn't fully suppress the thought that...um\\, I think this...this is not good. And when Finn and Rose arrived at the casino those voices were impossible to ignore.\\n\\nI walked out thinking\\, \\\"Hmm\\, well it's ok. A 3 out of 5 maybe?\\\" But over the last couple of days I've been processing it and thinking it's more like a 2 out of 5. Not only did The Last Jedi fail to actualize any of my hopes in a satisfying way\\, now I feel no anticipation of the next movie. Not only that - and it chagrins me to admit it - I may be ready to walk away from 40 years of Star Wars fandom. Not only is The Last Jedi bad in and of itself\\, but all of its flaws amplify the issues with the entire saga to such an extent that I don't think it's worth celebrating anymore.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed is the pacing: There were so many scenes with mass destruction and mayhem on such a grand scale and yet the scene would stop for long moments of suspense while we watched someone kick a ladder\\, or for BB-8 to fix the circuits in Poe's X-Wing\\, meanwhile it seems impossible that they would last that long in the midst of all the destruction we've seen in literal flashes of the eye. I know I'm watching a fantasy movie in space\\, but when the action doesn't adhere to the scene's own logic is when I am pulled out of the movie. As the movie wears on the bad pacing gets even more pronounced. For instance\\, while the most absurdly massive spaceship ever conceived chases a small rebel ship\\, there is time for an entire side-plot which seems to take a day or two. I've noticed this same tendency in the recent Marvel movies I've seen\\, like unintentional Brechtian reminders that I am in a theater watching a silly story\\, nothing more.\\n\\nRegarding the before-mentioned side-plot: the WORST part of the movie was the entire planning and execution - while being pursued by an armada of First Order ships - to go to another planet\\, try find a specific person on said planet\\, have a forced anti-capitalist conversation\\, get locked up\\, randomly meet someone else with the specific talents they are looking for\\, break free\\, free a bunch of kids and animals (except they actually didn't because in the end they just used them all to escape)\\, fly unnoticed into a giant warship\\, randomly find uniforms that fit perfectly\\, and almost succeed before being ratted out by the guy helping them. And in the end all that was for absolutely nothing. Worse than nothing\\, actually; if they had done nothing at all the Resistance would have been in better shape in the end.\\n\\nCanto Bight felt like something out of the prequels. Part of the wonder created by the Star Wars universe is how alien it feels while having just enough familiarity to be instantly engaging and grounding. That line is a thin\\, and one of the big issues with the prequels was that Lucas often went too far with familiarity. The worlds he made often felt too much like our own; examples that come to my mind are the podraces\\, with baseball-like announcers and crowds doing the wave\\, or the sports bar with robots playing a very football-like game on big screens. It takes me out of the movie to see that \\\"a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away\\\" looks so much like my own time and place. The casino\\, complete with slot machines\\, craps tables\\, poker chips\\, a little alien Monopoly man (he even had a monocle)\\, and a random opera singer\\, felt like a manifestation of Lucas' worst tendencies.\\n\\nI'm as anticapitalist as they come\\, and I should have cheered Rose's monologue about war profiteering\\, inequality\\, slavery\\, and animal cruelty-but god it was so ham-fisted and poorly delivered I felt embarrassed for everyone involved. It's like they did that for conservatives to make fun of \\\"social justice warriors.\\\" And as for the \\\"both sides\\\" stuff that Benicio Del Toro's character talked about: I'm all for nuance but not if it's delivered in the least nuanced way possible.\\n\\nA little more about the worst side-plot ever: I was really angry when Poe questioned and conspired against Laura Dern's character. Seeing a man buck a woman's leadership like that felt really gross\\, and I was relieved to see that there was a larger point. Poe was wrong and by trying to act like a hero (along with Finn and Rose) he actually made the situation much worse. I liked Johnson's attempt here but it was poorly written and there was no follow-through. No one seemed to actually learn any lessons\\, and in the end we were back where we started with the whole thing depending on individual heroism. They teased us with potential deconstructions\\, but no\\, it turned out to be the same old\\, same old.\\n\\nI actually liked much story of the Rey and Luke on Ahch-to. I thought it was brilliant that\\, after waiting two years to see what Luke would do when handed his (and his father's) old lightsaber\\, he just tossed it over his shoulder. Watching Luke be an alien-milking\\, fish-spearing hermit was satisfying\\, and I thought the porgs were pretty cute without veering into Ewok\/Jar Jar territory. Luke's explanation of the reason the Jedi had to end was convincing enough for me. It seemed to set up the saga to expand beyond its Jedi\/Sith nonsense with the Force becoming more egalitarian\\, but I'm not sure that's where things are ending up. And\\, as opposed to many fans\\, I didn't think Luke's character was inconsistent to who he was in the original trilogy. It makes sense that after all that he'd end up a hermit\\, unwilling to intervene in anything anymore.\\n\\nThe connection between Rey and Kylo was convincing\\, and I liked the scene in the (gorgeously designed) throne room. It was surprising to see Snoke die so early in the movie\\, but it felt empty. He had no back story\\, and we had no reason to understand any of his motivations. Emperor Palpatine had some benefit of these unknowns because we hadn't (yet) seen prior events take place-and at least when we did much of that story was on his rise to power. How is it that thirty years after Palpatine and the Empire some new\\, unknown dude with a stupid name came along and amassed such a ridiculous military? I felt like they needed to say something about where he came from and how he came to be. As with so many bad movies it's enough just to know he's evil for evil's sake-and you know that in part because he is deformed. I appreciate the diversity and strong women in the new trilogy\\, but can we move past this deformity = evil trope?\\n\\nSpeaking of backstories\\, I was annoyed by Rey's lack of one. It didn't bother me that her parents were not famous legends\\, in fact I was hoping for that\\, but there has to be some explanation for her visions\\, her connection with Anakin\/Luke's lighsaber\\, and her innate abilities to use the Force. Instead we are supposed to just accept that a random scavenger -- who happens to be on the same planet as the rusting Millennium Falcon\\, AND where Max von Sydow's character was hiding out with the map to Luke -- would be the next\\, great Jedi. I didn't want Rey to be a long-lost Skywalker\\, Solo\\, or Kenobi\\, but there has to be some reason for everything we saw in TFA. If none of that matters then honestly what's the point of anything in this story?\\n\\nKylo Ren is probably the best villain in Star Wars. He's complex and conflicted. Yes he's pathetic and insecure\\, but isn't anyone who's truly evil? Why else would someone be evil? Mastermind \\\"mwah-ha-ha\\\" villains like Palpatine or Snoke are harder to imagine\\, but Kylo makes perfect sense. I don't agree with people who thought he was too \\\"emo\\\" in TFA; think about the real life villains of this world\\, they're truly pathetic.\\n\\nWhile I'm on the topic of things I liked: The look of the movie. It was probably the best looking Star Wars movie. The ships\\, the creatures\\, Luke's island\\, Snoke's throne room\\, and the white and red sand planet were a feast for the eyes. But that's what made it all the more frustrating that the story didn't hold up. If you're going to put this much effort into a movie\\, can't you hire a decent script writer to tighten the story?\\n\\nHere's a question: Who was the most wasted actor in TLJ? Benicio Del Toro\\, Gwendoline Christie\\, or Lupita Nyong'o? Hard to say\\, but let's talk about Captain Phasma for a second: What was the point of her? She looked cool\\, all shiny and chrome\\, but it was another wasted opportunity to add some much needed dimensions to the Stormtroopers. There are so many things Christie's character could have done\\, but instead Phasma is nothing but a cool action figure. Maybe merchandise was her only purpose.\\n\\nFinally\\, I want to talk about the end. Early in A New Hope\\, we heard Darth Vader say that\\, \\\"the power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\\\" But never\\, after nine movies have we seen that to be true. Vader couldn't find the stolen data tapes\\, or catch the (broken down) Millennium Falcon. Luke couldn't save his friends\\, and had to set up an elaborate rigmarole to rescue Han Solo from an immobile\\, bariatric gangster. But General Organa felt that finding Luke would save the whole Resistance. Why? Johnson had the perfect opportunity finally demonstrate the awesome power of a Jedi knight-we could have seen (a flesh and blood) Luke defeat an army of AT-ATs (or whatever the new ones are called) and tie fighters\\, only to die in a duel with Kylo Ren. But instead\\, he died from projecting himself? That's the extent of the power of the Force? If it killed him then I guess so.\\n\\nWhen George Lucas made the original Star Wars\\, he was most influenced by Kurosawa's brilliant samurai movies. Among many themes was that after the proliferation of guns\\, the samurai\\, for all their elegant fighting styles and interesting costumes\\, were rendered irrelevant. What then\\, in a galaxy of giant warships that go light-speed and armies carrying blasters\\, is the point of the Jedi? The most bad-ass demonstration of the Force was Darth Vader at the end of Rogue One-but he took on\\, what\\,15 soldiers? He still couldn't get the Death Star plans that were like 50 feet away. The larger themes of Kurosawa's films were anti-military and anti-war\\, whereas Star WARS only celebrates militaristic escapades. For Kurosawa\\, the solutions to military might and injustice were for the common people to organize and band together; for Lucas\\, it's for a chosen one to abandon the fight to train in a swamp\\, and then try to redeem a mass murder simply because he's related. Sure\\, millions die in the process\\, but eh\\, we got to see Darth Vader smile!\\n\\nThat's the larger point of this essay. The Star Wars saga is just a bad story\\, and The Last Jedi puts a magnifying glass to all of its flaws. The only reason we see the heroes and villains as such is because we're told to in the opening crawls. Sure\\, the Empire and First Order blew up some planets\\, but the \\\"good guys\\\" do an almost equal amount of damage\\, to cheers and hugs. If Finn shows us the legions of soldiers for the Empire\/First Order are basically slaves taken against their will and trained to fight\\, then why is it ok to not flinch when millions of them die before our eyes? As with the recent superhero movies\\, the stakes have to always be so high that we witness a holocaust by the end of every movie\\, and then a few individuals we're told to root for high-five each other. Do the common folk of the Star Wars universe have any say in any of this? And no\\, one little kid staring at the night sky does not suffice.\\n\\nSo\\, perhaps \\\"from a certain point of view\\\" The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars movie because it finally gives us permission to walk away from the whole thing. Gary Kurtz\\, producer and co-creater of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back\\, thought that Return of the Jedi should have a darker\\, more ambivalent ending\\, with Luke Skywaker walking off alone \\\"like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti westerns.\\\" And for that Kurtz and Lucas parted ways. Perhaps now\\, like Kurtz and his intentions for Luke\\, we too should walk away\\, into the twin-sun horizon. We deserve better stories\\, better heroes. And yes\\, maybe John Williams can still write the scores.","true":true}
