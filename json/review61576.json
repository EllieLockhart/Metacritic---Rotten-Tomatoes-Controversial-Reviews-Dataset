The StoryFirst\\, the pros of the game:\r1.) Stunningly beautiful graphics and environment.\r-The jungle has taken over cities and the imaginative scenery feels more and more surreal as you delve deeper into this world.\r\r2.) All the interactions between Joel and Ellie are very well acted and captivating\\, almost on par with what we received in the first game.\r\rNow for the cons:\r1.) The Story\r-Everything except the few times mentioned above with Joel\\, the story feels forced and unnatural.\r-The characters that we grew to love in the first game\\, make out-of-character decisions in order to move along whatever story they\u2019re wanting to express\\, which is basically just a circle of violence and vengeance that is boring and predictable.\r-This story has a strong political motivation\\, trying to shoehorn in LGBTQ+ agendas\\, as well as new age feminism\\, forcing us into unrealistic decision making that goes against the gritty realism we\u2019ve come to expect from its predecessor.\r-The acting\\, taken out of context of the character and his\/her development is good\\, even great at points\\, but when you insert the context of the story\\, it makes you want to either roll your eyes in mockery or scream from frustration\\, to the point that you actually want the character you\u2019re playing to fail and die.\r2.) Gameplay\r-If you enjoyed the first game\u2019s gameplay\\, then you ought to enjoy this one too\\, because they\u2019re very close to the same with a little bit extra to keep it interesting. However\\, it\u2019s not nearly enough for the 25+ hour game time filled with mostly cutscenes\\, exploring\\, and fighting various baddies. They\u2019ve mostly done away with puzzles\\, of which I found novel in the first game\\, and replaced it with anemic exploration. And the puzzles that they do have are painstakingly obvious\\, to the point where the only difficult \u2018puzzle\u2019 is finding the exit.\r-Crafting has become slightly more complex\\, and with the increased options in advancing your skill set via supplements\\, you can experience a slightly altered version of Ellie and *unnamed* character\\, but it feels stale\\, adding very little newness.\r-Everything else is practically the same. You still find collectibles throughout the game\\, notes that hold combinations to safes\\, and nuts and bolts to modify your weapons.\rSigh\\, I wish this game was what I\u2019d hoped it would be.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
