Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to spoil anything\\, but I believe this movie will be looked back on as an important moment where Star Wars showed us that it can still surprise us 40 whole years later. It can change things\\, turn tropes on their head\\, and keep its soul as a movie about hope and goodness. There are flaws in this movie\\, there are narrative disconnects and there are some glaring character decisions that make absolutely zero sense. Overall\\, it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had watching Star Wars and it made the whole franchise better for its existence. Come into the movie fresh and enjoy a tense experience with excellent character development.","true":true}
