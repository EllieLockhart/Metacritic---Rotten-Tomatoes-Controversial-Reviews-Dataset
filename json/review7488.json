Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even worse than Force Awakens\\, which is slightly better. This is the worst Star Wars so far. Anyone saying these two newest movies keep the SW spirit alive\\, has good characters and good character development is lying to your face. All these good reviews are either paid off or know nothing of Star Wars.","true":true}
