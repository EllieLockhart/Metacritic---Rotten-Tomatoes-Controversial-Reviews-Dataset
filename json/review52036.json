Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After my second viewing I can comfortably say this film is amazing. It had a monumentally difficult task of moving the Star Wars movies into new territory. Honoring the past while blazing a new path forward and it succeeded without question. The Force Awakens was a very good movie but it mainly honored the past and did little to establish a new era of storytelling in the Star Wars Universe. This movie did just that and then some. It felt shocking and turned the Star Wars Universe on its head but also felt new and fresh while still feeling like it belonged in the Star Wars Saga. Genuinely impressive\\, I can't wait to see where it goes from here.","true":true}
