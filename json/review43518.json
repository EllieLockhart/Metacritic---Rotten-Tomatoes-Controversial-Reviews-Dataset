Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was deeply disappointing; I went into this fully expecting to love it and came out feeling like Rian Johnson was flipping me off for two and a half hours straight.  It basically comes down to how much of a Star Wars fan you are.  If you're only casually interested\\, you may still enjoy the movie - clearly some people do.  However\\, if you're a huge\\, lifelong fan\\, prepare to see everything you love about the series ruined (not just characters but also concepts) along with huge time-wasting plot gambits that go nowhere.  I will not be seeing any of the other new Star Wars films\\, which is a shamed because I actually liked TFA.","true":true}
