Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a let down after the Force Awakens and Rouge One. It is filled with plot holes\\, needless storyline and poor editing. It has horrible continuity and seems like it was just Disney advertising there new range of annoying merchandise. This had so much promise\\, there are some real quality actors and parts of the story that just needed development. In the end though it was like a hot dropped pie\\, it had good ingredients and could had been great\\, but instead it's a steaming heap.","true":true}
