Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that this was Carrie Fisher's last movie makes me so incredibly sad. It pains me that the last thing we will ever see her in is a incoherent\\, unevenly paced\\, illogical\\, predictable\\, ugly\\, inconsistent movie that couldn't even get the characters right. Luke Skywalker wasn't himself in this movie and neither were any of the other characters on the light side. It failed to answer the questions we had after the force awakens and the only question it did answer - Rey's parentage - didn't feel satisfying at all. Even the editing was bad\\, as during a lot of the movie the scenes were so dark I couldn't see what was going on. We wanted a darker tone\\, not a darker screen. \\n\\nFinal verdict: Rian Johnson\\, well done. You made a worse Star Wars movie than George Lucas did in the 00's. At least the prequels add something to the story and are at times fun. The last Jedi added nothing and was a pain to sit through.","true":true}
