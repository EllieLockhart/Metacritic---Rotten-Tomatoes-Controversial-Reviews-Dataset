Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really not happy with the direction of this Star Wars movie. I loved every single Star Wars film up until this one...I really am hoping they redeem themselves with IX.","true":true}
