The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I tried really hard to like this game\\, from the combat\\, the gameplay mechanics\\, even to the plot. However I found myself disliking the game\\, the more I played of it\\, from the death of Joel\\, to having to play as his killer and forced to sympathize with her character through some of her missions\\, and the ending of Ellie not even being able to commit to how far you have to take her character. It\u2019s not good\\, the first few hours before Joel does\\, that was good\\, that felt like maybe Joel and Ellie would find a way to resolve their conflict. I get that what was done in the first games ending\\, had to have some resolution of its own\\, but doing it this way was not the way to go for me.I honestly feel like\\, this game lost its sense of joy in its dark world. I loved playing as Joel and Ellie in the first game\\, even how the characters developed. With the sequel\\, I just can\u2019t get with the narrative and the ending just feels like a slap in the face to the whole adventure. Gameplay wise\\, I think mechanics could have been upgraded from what was done before\\, yet I feel like a lot of politics and hypocrisy are also to blame for what became of this game. So many people in industry want to praise this game instead of look at its flaws\\, and this game has some flaws in both narrative and gameplay. Graphics and animation are great\\, but they do not save a game if the story isn\u2019t great with it. The character of Abbey that you play as\\, I hated having to play with her\\, it wasn\u2019t even just her torturing Joel\\, it was her character as a whole. I\u2019ll be honest\\, when this games trailers originally introduced back in 2016\\, I thought she was Ellie\u2019s mother and that they would explain don what happened to her and how Ellie became immune to begin with. I played Left Behind\\, I know the story\\, but that would have been a great way to go and having Ellie and Joel go on an adventure that meshed the two storylines together where they meet in different time periods.  The whole cult idea could still be utilized\\, but I think the game shouldn\u2019t forget about its zombie roots either. I\u2019m sad to see a promising series go this route\\, and really hope that if something like this is attempted again\\, that the characters you play as well as the story\\, aren\u2019t so misguided and without life.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
