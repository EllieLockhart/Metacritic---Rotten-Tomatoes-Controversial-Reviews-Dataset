Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly disappointing film. Even with Leia and Luke as part of the cast this movie was just disappointing. Mark Hamill reportedly told Johnson \\\"I fundamentally disagree with everything you've done with this character in this film.\\\"\\n\\nJohnson really screwed the pooch\\, and this comes as a very big fan of both Brick and Looper.","true":true}
