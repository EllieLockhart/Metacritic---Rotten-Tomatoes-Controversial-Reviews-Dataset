Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst the film was beautifully shot I felt the pacing was a bit jerky and that there was one too many plotlines (two of which could have easily been merged together). The film with the exception of the title crawl and the battle between the millennium falcon and tie fighters\\, didn't feel like Star Wars. I also felt lime there was no real consequences\\, and that the first order were too incompetent to take seriously. It was entertaining but overall I felt disappointed. I will go and see it for a second and maybe third time and perhaps my opinion will change but as of the first viewing that's it.","true":true}
