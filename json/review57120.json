Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is how absolutely terrible this movie is.  I made an account with rotten tomatoes to write this review this month of February\\, when I saw it the weekend after it came out. After driving cross country for a solid YEAR in a semi\\, I finally decided to see it with family. I'm still completely and utterly disappointed in it. The awesome well put together for years and years chronological history of the entire star wars universe\\, the books\\, the comics\\, the games\\, the cartoons... All adding up to decades of clever\\, hard thought\\, creative fictional history adding in some awesome way to this fictional universe\\, has succumbed to a pathetic statement of liberalism. AND IM LIBERAL\\, I'm so bumbbed out. Well I'm gonna continue to drive my truck and do my part to support the country I love in my own way for as long as I can before it leaves me behind too. But I'm never going to deliver a load for Disney or any of its subsidiaries.","true":true}
