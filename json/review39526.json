Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a fun\\, exciting addition to the Star Wars saga. It's not perfect\\, but it's definitely one of the greats. The cinematography\\, visuals\\, characters\\, and score were all brilliant. I. Love. This. Movie. While it has several glaring flaws\\, the pros far outweigh the cons.","true":true}
