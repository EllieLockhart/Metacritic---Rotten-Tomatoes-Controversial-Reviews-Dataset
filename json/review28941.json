Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointing. Drops all the amazing character setup JJ sand Kasdan did in The Force Awakens. Really bummed out by how bad it is.\\nFelt like a Marvel studios movie with Star Wars window dressing. Haven't felt this let down since the hobbit movies","true":true}
