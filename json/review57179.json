Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first time I have revised a rating based on a multiple viewing. I watched The Last Jedi for the second time\\, mostly because Ladybird was sold out. While I enjoyed it the first time\\, the flaws screamed out on the rewatch. The plot is pretty minimal\\, Finn's side mission is pointless\\, and our hero Luke Skywalker is just depressing to see. And I'm sorry\\, seeing Rey as a super charged Mary Sue is agitating. You can't root for a protagonist who excels at almost every challenge and seems to have the wbility to best everyone at everything. It took Luke Skywalker almost three movies to become a strong Jedi\\, and Rey is all that right off the bat along with an ace pilot\\, mechanic\\, and basically anything else the plot calls for. At the end of the film I had one thought - how is one ship full of about 35-40 people supposed to present any real threat to the still powerful First Order? I guess it's Rey against the galaxy\\, and in this trilogy Rey will probqbly take everyone in a cakewalk.","true":true}
