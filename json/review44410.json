Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much action\\, too many explosions - not enough plot\\, not enough acting. The movie is essentially one giant battle scene and you are taken through it all at light speed. I missed the balance of past Star Wars films.  Entertaining\\, but a far cry from Episode 7.","true":true}
