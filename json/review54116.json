Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't see all the hate for this movie. Sure it diverted from expectations\\, and some of the storylines we wanted resolved weren't (such as Snoke's history\\, Rey's parents\\, and the Knights of Ren)\\, but for me it was a fantastic film of unexpected joy. There were some really awesome fight scenes and space battles. And the connection between Kylo and Rey was well done. Who cares if Snoke is gone? Make way for the real villain: Kylo Ren. The force powers were weird\\, but really cool and welcome additions to the franchise. This is the first time we actually see Leia use force powers other than communication with Luke. They could have done away with the casino planet and had a 2 hour movie instead of a 2.5 hour movie\\, but this is my #2 star wars\\, with Empire being #1.","true":true}
