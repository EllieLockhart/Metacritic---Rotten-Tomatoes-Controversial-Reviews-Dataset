Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can sum up this movie in a few 3 word phrases that portray my disappointment and disgust with what was on the screen...\\n\\n1.  Rose Rose Binks\\n2.  Luke's \\\"lazer sword\\\"\\n3.  Flying Leia Poppins\\n4.  Slow speed chase\\n5.  Captain Phasma falls\\n6.  Sea cow milk\\n7.  Crait is Hoth\\n8.  Social Justice Drivel\\n9.  Rey is nobody\\n10. Chewie is vegan\\n11. Holding for Hux\\n12. Yoda acts drunk\\n13. Snoke's lame death\\n14. Burning Jedi texts\\n15. Boring as hell\\n\\nFix these issues and you'd have a 5 star movie on your hands.","true":true}
