I think the way people experience this game is very personal. I personally think the story is good\\, Naughty dog set out to make a game in which you will have to do things you don't want to do. There were many moments where I put away my controller because i needed to get myself together before being able to continue playing. That might sound like a negative thing\\, but those moments\\, when you pause or even quit the game for a moment and think about what's happening\\, are exactly what Naughty dog want from you. The story constantly makes you feel contradictory\\, and i love it for it.\rBesides this\\, the gameplay was similar to that of the first game but more streamlined\\, more realistic and with more options for how you want to approach combat and non-combat situations. It took the good parts of the gameplay of the first game and improved on it.\rThe game looks stunning\\, i was impressed that all of this was possible on a PlayStation 4.\rThen there is the acting and the music. I'm putting both of these together because it without it the story would have fallen flat and both were able to deliver the extra layer of emotion that was necessary for me to give this game a 10.\rOverall i'd say\\, if you liked the last of us (part 1?)\\, and liked how in that game you were made to think about morality because of how you were forced to do something you might not have done yourself and liked how Naughty dog is able to make you feel all kinds of things\\, I think you will like this game just as much as the first one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
