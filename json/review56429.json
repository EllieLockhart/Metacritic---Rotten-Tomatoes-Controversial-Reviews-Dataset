Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest problem is that none of the intrigue set up by Force Awakens is followed through in any way.  There are no heroes in this movie.  Luke is now an antihero who decides not to help at all.  Good thing they spent a whole movie finding him?!  Snoke was set up to be an all powerful Sith enemy... maybe we'll find put something about him?  Nope\\, killed.  That heirloom lightsaber that \\\"finds\\\" Rey and she holds out in earnest for Luke...he throws it down a hill and it's later destroyed.  Maybe Rey's backstory?  Nope she's no one.  The second problem is there is no plot.  The only thing that really happens is that Snoke is killed.  But who's Snoke?  Why care I guess.  The throneroom lightsaber scene has all the gravitas of a scene from Attack of the clones.  Oh I forgot\\, there was that part the rebels almost ran out of gas....  It's pretty clear why they are bringing Abrams back.","true":true}
