Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that the critics review is 92 means that disney paid a ton of money out to critics! Hope they have more money to pay  for more positive audience reviews cause this movie truly SUCKED!","true":true}
