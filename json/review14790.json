Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have sooooo many issues with it. Felt attachment to nobody. Too many plot lines at once. Really stupid obvious jokes. No mysticism or hero\u2019s journey present. I can go on and on. I know everyone will love it. It\u2019s just feeding into blind fan boy culture. Star Wars has lost all its heart\\, storytelling and passion and traded it for fast paced video game\\, fanboy fame culture. These movies once told great trials of being a human and making meaning of your life journey. Now it\u2019s just..pew pew pew.","true":true}
