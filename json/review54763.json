Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It all starts to make sense to me now: The Last Jedi\\, a film directed by Rian Johnson\\, but written by Disney's marketing department. Why was the movie so horrid to the fans that grew up on the Original Trilogy\\, while at the same time\\, fans that grew up on the Prequels generally loved the movie? Because Disney's sole purpose was to get rid of the \\\"old fanbase\\\" and start focussing on the new group of fans. Shifting demographics.... I understand it and it is a justified move. The millennials are better consumers of the SW merchandise anyway. But why did you had to release such a horrid movie? Oh wait\\, another part of the marketing scheme to let the \\\"old fans\\\" down\\, so they loose interest in the franchise. I think if you explained this upfront\\, the movie would received more praise. Hell\\, even the \\\"old fans\\\" would have watched and cheered of what will happen next to this franchise. Now it was just horrible movie\\, driven by marketing decisions. Phasma\\, o she doesn't sell\\, bye\\, Snoke\\, nope\\, bye\\, Luke Skywalker\\, these new fans don't even know about this guy\\, bye. Ugh\\, what a way to mess up a beautiful story that inspired so many. I guess in Ep 9 even Poe\\, Finn and Rey will die\\, because they don't shift enough units. So sad but true.","true":true}
