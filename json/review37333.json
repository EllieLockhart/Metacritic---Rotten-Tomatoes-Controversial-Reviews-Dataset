Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot was all over the place. No cohesive themes and the characterization had the depth of an autist. The visuals were shlocky and reminded me of Batman v Superman. The film needs to examine itself more and analyze the psychologies of its characters. Excessive amounts of action plague the film at the expense of internal analysis.","true":true}
