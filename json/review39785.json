Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an example of what disney will do to the greatest movies. They extended the mean of the force by making telepathy and human illusions possible. Definately the worst Star Wars ive seen. They just told us Reys parents are nobody special and imediatly killed snoke. Ugh","true":true}
