Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! I'm a huge Star Wars fan and this is one of the best in the series for sure. This movie had everything I love about the series - awesome space battles\\, interesting new worlds\\, FUN. It also wasn't afraid to leave behind predictable cliches and take things in new directions. That's a very good thing! I'm sad to see that some in the fan community don't see it that way and wanted a predictable rehash\\, or wanted some version of Star Wars that apparently only has ever existed in their minds. In any case\\, can't wait to see where the series goes from here\\, especially Rian Johnson's trilogy!","true":true}
