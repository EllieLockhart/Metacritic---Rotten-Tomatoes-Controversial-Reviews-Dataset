Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was downright one of the best Star Wars movies\\, and it's due to just one thing. It is the first Star Wars specifically because it takes RISKS and they PAY OFF!! The entire movie is completely unpredictable and that's what keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. People who don't like it want more of the originals\\, but new viewers and Star Wars lovers will love the new installment that furthers the lore and development of many characters.","true":true}
