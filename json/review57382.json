Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie seems to troll the very basis of Star Wars fans. Disney has shot themselves in the foot\\, by teasing certain characters\\, their backstories and elements of the story far too strongly\\, making them seem important and leaving everything incredibly vague at the end of TFA\\, only to blow it all up in a \\\"humorous\\\" manner\\, and give us fans the fault for feeling dissapointed. \\nI can not shake the feeling\\, that they have no true respect for us fans (more so for our wallets)\\, and that this movie was purposely made\\, to weed out a huge portion of hardcore Star Wars fans (as we are far too unpleasable and picky to take along the ride)\\, so only those people are left\\, who do not care or mind where the story goes\\, or if the entire Skywalker Saga will end in the most disrespectful and harsh way it could possibly end. Yes\\, this family story must and will find an end with Episode 9\\, there is no denying about that. But goddamn it\\, there are more respectful ways to do so. The end of this movie left me with one crushing thought: The way Ben Solo\\, who is the only Skywalker left now (with Luke gone and Carry Fisher passing away)\\, was turned into this irredeemable Asshole\\, who's very own mother has given up on him\\, makes chances of a redemption and a balanced way for the Skywalker Saga to end very\\, very dire. Most people now expect him to die whithout any doupt. And that they have no problem with that\\, honestly makes me very afraid of the next movie. Maybe Rey is the only hope left now\\, as she is the only person who got close enough to Ren mentally and emotionally\\, to make the Skywalker saga end in a fullfilling\\, respectful and hopeful way. In the end\\, that's what Star Wars was always about\\, that there is always hope. The end of this movie however\\, left me with none.","true":true}
