Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think you need to go into the movie with an open mind and remember that this is a new trilogy\\, not the originals. I don\u2019t understand the hate that some are giving this movie. I absolutely loved it (it\u2019s not my all time favorite\\, but I still really really enjoyed it). I liked the pacing of the plot going between the three main stories. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for those who haven\u2019t seen it\\, so here\u2019s a couple of spoiler-free things I will say: 1. There\u2019s a bunch of easter eggs and callbacks to the original trilogy (as you would expect lol) 2. There\u2019s a few new faces in this movie\\, some of which play an important roll in helping the main trio. 3. There are several plot twists that I didn\u2019t expect (I was practically gaping at one point) 4. There\u2019s a lovely send-off for a character (it\u2019s probably not who you\u2019re thinking though). 5. FINALLY: the fight between being considered a part of the \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark\u201d side is getting more complicated. I\u2019m really hoping they\u2019re sending Rey on the grey Jedi path (that\u2019s just my own hope though). Anyway\\, ignore the hatred that some people are spewing and forge your own opinion on the movie. Give it a shot\u2014 it\u2019ll be what you expect and more! Regardless\\, there\u2019s still another movie to look forward to for anyone who\u2019s bummed out.","true":true}
