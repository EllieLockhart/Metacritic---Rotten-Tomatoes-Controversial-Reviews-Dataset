Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is one of those Movies that I think is gonna have a more positive outlook on it in the future as potentially the best of the sequels (much like Empire Strikes back for the original trilogy) The film is adventurous\\, offers a new outlook on the Star Wars galaxy and mythos\\, and was honestly the only film in the sequels trilogy to develop any of its main characters (Rey from an aspiring force sensitive rebel to an actual Jedi\\, Finn from someone who wanted to run away from it all to someone willing to die for the resistance\\, Poe from someone wanting to get the job done to someone who realizes that the lives of others and his comrades are why he fights\\, and Kylo Ren from a Darth Vader idolizer to the Supreme leader of the First Order and wanting to carve his own legacy separate from his namesake.) Its also visually stunning and maybe the best looking Star Wars movie. All the set pieces\\, shot angles\\, framing\\, and editing are all very tight and flow well. Ultimately\\, this is a very well made film despite its divisive content according to the fanbase.","true":true}
