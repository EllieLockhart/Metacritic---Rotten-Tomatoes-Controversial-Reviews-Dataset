Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This currently has a worse audience score than the Phantom Menace and that is completely and utterly stupid. I personally think this is a great addition to the series I enjoyed watching it. This doesn\u2019t deserve all the hate it\u2019s getting.","true":true}
