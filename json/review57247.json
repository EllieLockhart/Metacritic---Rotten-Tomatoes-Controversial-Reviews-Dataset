Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie feels like they had a couple scenes it wanted to do\\, and everything else was written around it. As such\\, one plot line was great\\, one was confusing\\, and the other was completely pointless in a 30 minute sidetrack with a ticking clock. It breaks a lot of established rules of the Star Wars universe\\, which is quite the feat when characters can lift rocks with basically magic. The humor is dreadful. Most scenes with any importance are undercut by a joke\\, often times by characters that don't even need to be in the movie. Well\\, except now they can sell toys of them. It's a puzzling adventure that will definitely be worthy of discussing with friends with many of their choices.","true":true}
