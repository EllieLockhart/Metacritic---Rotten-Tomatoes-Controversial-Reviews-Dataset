Some might find it pretty repetetitive but there is an ability later on which makes you avoid random street fights.\r\r9.5 - Graphics: For a game which has low budget compared to other triple A titles\\, the graphics are pretty amazing especially in cutscenes...not to forget this was originally on a ps3 and later on released on ps4.\r\r10\/10 - Overall: Imo this game is worth buying a ps4 alone and you will never regret my words\\, i woud even recommend playing it before titles like Uncharted 4. Hope everyone enjoys this wonderful game before the release of Yakuza Kiwami which is the remake of yakuza 1 on August 29 2017.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
