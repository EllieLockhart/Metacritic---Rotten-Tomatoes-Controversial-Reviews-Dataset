Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the worst of the Star Wars movies. So much wasted screen time on a stupid sub plot\\, None of the satisfying moments that fans have been hoping for since 1983\\, and a director who came across as making terrible choices for the movie just because he wanted to separate the movie from the other ones and because he could. \\n\\nWell separate it he did\\, right into a trash compactor. Even the prequels had redeeming moments in them that make them somewhat enjoyable to go back and watch. This entire movie was stuffed full of contrived plot devices and character moments that overall made the story feel cheap and half-assed. \\n\\nNot Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker\\, and not mine either.","true":true}
