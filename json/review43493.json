Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was bad for any movie - plot holes galore\\, lackluster character development\\, no emotional resonance. It was flat and disappointing. Bad enough to sink any movie\\, but particularly disappointing in a Star Wars core franchise film. Disney should be ashamed.","true":true}
