Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney's sailing on sight. \\nIt's just a statement and a scandal. \\nThe Last Jedi is to Star Wars what Prometheus is at the Alien saga. \\nA pretty poorly written reboot\\, full of inconsistencies. \\nThe worst Star Wars movie ever\\, by far. I'm sad an angry of what johnson has done with our legends... Honnestly don't waste your money","true":true}
