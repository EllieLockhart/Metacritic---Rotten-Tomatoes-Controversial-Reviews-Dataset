Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey Poe\\, show some f'n respect to 3PO you douchebag nobody! Oh\\, and hoorraaayyyyy for the forced down our throats social justice girl power bullshit! It's about as realistic as me asking Luke Skywalker to pick up a gallon of milk on his way home from his \\\"laser sword\\\" battle with Kylo Renny-Poo. Here's a spinoff movie idea ... Finn and Rose to star in \\\"Dude\\, Where's My Car 2\\\" ... the whole movie is them searching for someone to help find their car and all the while falling in love right before our eyes because their on screen chemistry is THAT GOOD! Benicio del Toro to star as the backwards parking lot attendant who steals their stereo and pawns it for enough cash to buy a 12-piece crispy porg bucket. It would be so epic.","true":true}
