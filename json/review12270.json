Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not one to rate movies on any website but I felt so annoyed after coming out of this movie. I'm about as big a Star Wars fan as you can be and I am sick to my stomach right now. This movie does not build on what was established in The Force Awakens and left me confused as to how the people in charge ok'd the direction of Rian Johnson. Plot holes as wide as the Grand Canyon and Disney should be embarrassed with how they handled Luke Skywalker\\, one of the greatest movie heroes ever. I've always trusted RT with their reviews and usually they turn out to be correct. But giving this movie a 93% is so blatantly wrong. People have always complained about RT's bias towards Disney movies and I've always thought they were just grabbing at any excuse they could think of. I am starting to realize these people may actually be right.","true":true}
