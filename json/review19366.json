Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's punchy fun pulp\\, like the original trilogy.  Not quite as well-balanced or coherent\\, probably because it is meant to appeal to such a wide range of ages now\\, as opposed to the distinct subculture Episode IV and its immediate sequels were created for.  The casino scene was overly long\\, and the Poe-led mutiny was also a sideline that did little to enhance the story.  I had no problem with Leia's Peter Pan routine in space\\, btw.  I actually expected something like that; her natural gift with the Force had yet to manifest in any significant way throughout the movies\\, and it seemed that it was either now-or-never for that to happen.  I rather wish Leia's force-wielding powers had been given a bit greater significance in the movie (and in Force Awakens\\, for that matter)\\, but I can't overly fault them for not going that route.  Otherwise\\, despite these quibbles\\, it was very enjoyable and true to the spirit of the original movies.  The quirky humor and weirdness of several scenes was welcome\\, such as Luke drinking the milk of the giant alien animal.  Can't wait for Episode IX!","true":true}
