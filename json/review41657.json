Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just the worst star wars movie the galaxy has ever seen plot is just long and boring and the final battle is bad ripoff of the battle of hoth while the overpowered rey gets called a jedi after some medetation she can do more after a few days then luke could after months this movie should like the live action avatar the last airbender movie be something fans dont want to hear or mention","true":true}
