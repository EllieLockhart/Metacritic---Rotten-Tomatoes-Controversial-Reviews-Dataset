Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forget the last 40 years of star wars and perhaps its bearable. Please never touch Star Wars again Rian Johnson\\, spare us. Some how you managed to strip its heart and soul by making it completely void of any substance\\, conviction or direction. \\nApparently Yoda\\, Obi Wan\\, Luke\\, and every other Jedi wasted all their time bothering to learn about the force and about following the light. This movie makes Luke's journey to become a Jedi through The original movies look like a pointless odyssey which would have happened eventually. \\nI have never been so let down by a movie and I saw all the Hobbit movies... all of them. I have loved Star Wars since I was five and it was simply my childhood. This is the first Star Wars addition that I have ever wanted to be destroyed other than the Christmas special and I have seen the Battle of Endor\\, The Caravan of Courage\\, read the EU\\, and watched the cartoons.
