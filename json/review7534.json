Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is upset because they didn't get what they wanted out of this movie\\, but I loved it. Not everything that happened is finite\\, some questions can still be answered\\, they wanted to shake things up and I'm all for it","true":true}
