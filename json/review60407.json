Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"7 years. Waiting 7 years fot that. Incredible graphics\\, ok. Amazing landscapes and atmospheres\\, ok. Awfully realistic ambients\\, ok. Good ol' TLoU gameplay and shooting\\, still the same but ok. All the cool undead monsters\\, ok. The soundtracks\\, just wow. But now tell me HOW it is ok to destroy loved characters like that\\, and to force players to play as a character they HATE (because yes\\, everyone who has a brain hates Abby). 30 hours (7 years for 30 hours?) of pure pain\\, fighting Runners\\, Clickers and so on and so forth\\, using a detestably character\\, and while being brainwashed about lesbians and trans and other **** that no one would care about during a freakin Apocalypse. And everything just to wink at LGBTQWandGodknowswhat+ and snowflake's agenda\\, just to be praised by the media and by the critics... And for everyone who thinks that \\\"the far right is \\\"bombing\\\" TLoU 2\\\"\\,  that's complete bull****\\, it's just that they destroyed their own fan-base with that cringe dlc they call a game. It's not homophobic or transphobic to whish to play a sequel that does not try to denaturalize the main characters... a lost opportunity for a really good game\\, and that's truly a shame\u2026 Expand","true":true}
