Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing\\,  best Star Wars movie yet. So many epic scenes and suprises.  Ignore the loser fans who have been waiting for this movie in mommies basement.\\n\\nI'm so tired of these whining star wars fans. Star Wars has always lacked that punch\\, even in the movie Rey says the force is controlling minds and moving rocks. This movie added cool new abilities to the force. I don't get what more people want.\\n\\nI love when people say to many plot holes. How dumb are you people? its the second movie of a trilogy\\, you need to wait for the third ( and final ).","true":true}
