Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's entry in the sequel trilogy is so tonally off-base and throws away so much of what was set up both in The Force Awakens and the previous 6 movies.  The comedy in this movie is so jarring and the story premise is so odd (fuel has never been an issue in the star wars universe but suddenly it is?).  The movie contains pointless story lines (Canto Bight)\\, throws away important characters (Admiral Akbar)\\, introduces unnecessary new ones to drive conflict (Admiral Holdo)\\, and illogically makes Luke Skywalker a whiny hermit instead of the ever-hopeful Jedi he was in the original trilogy.","true":true}
