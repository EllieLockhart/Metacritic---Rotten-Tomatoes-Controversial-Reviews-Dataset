Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow what a massive turd. I can't believe this film has been released. Is it supposed to be for fans of the franchise because if so it misses the mark by a long shot. It undoes all the good work of the Force Awakens and leaves you with a mish mash of a film. Luke Skywalker deserved better. Shouts to Admiral Ackbar and Phasma.","true":true}
