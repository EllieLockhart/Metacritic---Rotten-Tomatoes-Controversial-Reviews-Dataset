Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been going to Star Wars films since I was 7 years old; I was there in 1977 to see the original and I've seen them all more times than I care to count. This film was different than anything I have previously seen and I give Rian Johnson credit for having the stones to do something different with this franchise. I think so many people don't like this film because of their own expectations\\, because of what they want and what they expect. If you leave those expectations behind\\, what you see is a film that's thought provoking\\, touching\\, funny and unlike anything I've ever seen in a Star Wars film. While I liked the Force Awakens\\, it just seemed too easy\\, a rehash of A New Hope. This one? Not a rehash of anything...a truly original Star Wars film. I can't say enough about this movie...I loved it\\, and not because it delivered what I expected\\, but because it didn't\\, which was refreshing. One of the central themes of the film is the idea of leaving the past behind and moving forward and I think we too have to do this as viewers of this film. Great\\, great\\, great!!!","true":true}
