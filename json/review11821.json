Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How this has a worse audience score then justice league is beyond my understanding lol Overall it was a good film that let down the \\\"theory crafters\\\" who tried to guess at all the big reveals. Was it the best star wars movie ever? no. Was it as bad as some people are \\\"reviewing\\\" it? Hell NO. Enjoy it for what it is and dont try to over analyze it.","true":true}
