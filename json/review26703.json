Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, this movie was entertaining enough and great to look at\\, but it defecated all over the characters and set-up that preceded it. I\u2019m all for originality and a unique take\\, but not at the cost of feeling crappy when you leave the theatre. What they did with Luke was a travesty\\, and I could fly a star destroyer through the plot holes. The humor was forced and awkward\\, and it was all very un-Star Wars like. ","true":true}
