Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The ending felt like they just threw something together because they had to do it. It didn't seem to wrap up the movie well nor set it up for Episode IX. The lack of backstory about the First Order and Rey's parents that we all thought we would get\\, we didn't. Still\\, it was the spectacle that we were hoping for\\, just a few pieces weren't up to par. Hence\\, 4 out of 5 stars.","true":true}
