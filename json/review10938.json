Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hate the Star Wars franchise and praying for its death? Then look no further\\, this is the movie for you! In 2 hours and 32 minutes\\, this POS kills off any chance of revival for the beloved franchise. I want to wish JJ Abrams the best of luck trying to flush this turd in episode 9!","true":true}
