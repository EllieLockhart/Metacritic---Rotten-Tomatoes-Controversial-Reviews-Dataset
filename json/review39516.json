Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film tries to deliver a message which is out of character for the entire franchise up to this point. While the social themes and interesting character twists are relevant and fresh in our world\\, they felt out of place using this universe as its vehicle. What adds to the agony is the plethora of absolutely stunning visuals mixed with a poorly set up story line and the violation of basic cinema narrative. If you are familiar with basic screenplay theory\\, you see a range of grievous errors that lead to the negative feedback experienced by this movie. I could have stood behind Luke\\, Holdo and Rose if only there was more to them and deeper meaning behind why they behaved as they did \\\"within\\\"  the movie.","true":true}
