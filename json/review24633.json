Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was a disaster\\, Disney clearly put their fingerprints all over it no character Dev and a chase to a planet that had no effect on the plot\\, Leia flying so many things were childish and foolish I will not recommend people see this movie wait until you can stream it for free don't waste your money.","true":true}
