Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi Trying to be Empire Strikes Back\\, Feels forced and drawn out\\nmixed feelings\\, went from caring about the characters in force awakens to \\nwe are gonna have to break up I think I wanna see other characters now\\, I lost interest in what made the characters lovable they were no longer lovable. When it was over I thought to myself we could have accomplished all this an hour ago...\\nkids liked it had entertainment value for them but no depth for true fans. I think they tried to make you feel like when Empire was over and never got there...that feeling of Oh No We have to wait 2 years to see whats gonna happen that can't be the end but instead I felt like man I'm glad that's the end.","true":true}
