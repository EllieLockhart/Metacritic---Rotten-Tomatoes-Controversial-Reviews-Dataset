Stupid of me\\, but I find them mostly forced and in there just for the PC likes. This is not the case in this game\\, I had just as much fun playing as the females in this game as I did playing Kratos or Arthur Morgan\\, they were **** brutal. The graphics are the best I\u2019ve ever seen in a game. I am a PC gamer first and foremost\\, and this tops RDR2 for me in that department. Easily the best character animations in gaming\\, just unreal. You can tell the hours that went into this\\, it\u2019s extremely polished from top to bottom.The story threw me throughout and I enjoyed the multiple character aspect\\, particularly how it played into the story. I won\u2019t spoil but I liked this story more than the first Last of Us.Gameplay was sick\\, lots of variation on how you can attack the encounters throughout. Just such a brutal game\\, having just come from playing God of War I was not suspecting this to make me react more than that with how cool and just **** up some of the kill animations are in this\\, particularly when I died. All in all\\, having played games for 20+ years now this game would comfortably sit in my top 5 comfortably alongside Red Dead 1\\, Assassins Creed 2\\, God of War and Witcher 3.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
