Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in to this movie with a few fan theories\\, just like most other fans. But what I got instead of theory confirmations was an excellent Star Wars movie that mixed up the bag and reinvented it. I loved every second of this movie and it is definitely one of my favourite Star Wars installments yet. Can't wait to see it again","true":true}
