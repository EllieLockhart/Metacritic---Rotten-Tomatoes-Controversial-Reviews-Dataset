Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is almost a \\\"so bad it's good\\\" film - but not quite.  It is just very bad - a poor script\\, a poor story\\, and some poor acting.   I loved the SW films as a kid in the 80s and The Force Awakens was good.  But the Last Jedi is right down at the bottom of the barrel with the Prequels.  There are several laugh out loud moments in the film - but none of them intentional.  An embarrassment of a film.","true":true}
