Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As if it wasn't already clear\\, we can now fully see what Disney intends to do with the Star Wars franchise. This film was a pitiful display of corporate values through the form of over-used cutesy characters\\, frequent over the top forced comedy during serious moments\\, and loosely connected plot elements strewn together through serious writing gymnastics. Unfortunately as it stands\\, this is the worst film of the franchise.","true":true}
