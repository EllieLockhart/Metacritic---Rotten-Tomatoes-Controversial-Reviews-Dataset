Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good story\\, good characters\\, good direction\\, most plot holes can be solved within 5 minutes of thought. Honestly just listen to the critics\\, they know more about how this movie is genuinely good instead of just how it didn't pander to fans.","true":true}
