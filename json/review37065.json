Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new lead character of this generation of Star Wars movies is really badly thought out. It has 0 defects\\, 0 hardships to overcome\\, perfect at everything. In comparison\\, the original trilogy was about learning how to lose\\, to improve\\, to thrive in the face of adversity. This movie was just Rey smashing through everything with ease\\, with almost no training\\, being able to go toe to toe with and even beating characters that devoted their entire life\\, starting from childhood\\, to fighting. That is bad writing\\, and keeps nobody glued to their screen\\, it's like a Superman movie where there is no kryptonite\\, no enemy kryptionians or any powerful aliens\\, just Superman versus regular humans.","true":true}
