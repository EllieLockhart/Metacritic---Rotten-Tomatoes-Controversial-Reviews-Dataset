Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To put simply\\, this movie is saga chushing. That is how bad it is.\\n\\nSome people relate this movie to bad fanfiction. That is a horrible understatment. Imagine\\, sitting your 6 year old down after watching The Force Awakens and asking then to write the next installment. Yeah\\, that is how bad it is. Most fans who create fanfiction have at least some inkling of the rules Star Wars has. Not this film.\\n\\nAs expected\\, nothing is earned and everything is contrived. Character development is either nonexistence or butchered. \\n\\nSo the plot is basically a battle star galactica episode where our heroes are running out of gas while fleeing the enemy that can track them through lightspeed travel. Yeah\\, its as stupid as it sounds for a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nIdk why\\, but when I was a kid\\, I was never thinking....Where do the rebels fill up for gas? Where do the rebels buy their spaceships? Can force ghosts call down lightning? Can Jedi project themselves across the galexy? I guess I wasn't was creative as Rian as a child.","true":true}
