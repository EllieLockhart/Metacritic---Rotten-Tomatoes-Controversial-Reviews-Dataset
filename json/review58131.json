Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worth seeing\\, but not compelling.  Start slow (really slow) but it gets much better.  Out with the old and in with the new.  Rey remains a strong character for future movies.  There are a few things we are expected to accept that just don't make sense\\, even trying to suspend disbelief.","true":true}
