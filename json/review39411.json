Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is so bad Disney are paying for bots to 5 star this. 9\/10 of the 4-5 star reviews have 'Page not found' when you click on them. Steve Aceti whos about 3 reviews back\\, has only started reviewing once TLJ had its release and reviewed Disney films only(COINCIDENCE??). Shame on RT for being complicit in this.","true":true}
