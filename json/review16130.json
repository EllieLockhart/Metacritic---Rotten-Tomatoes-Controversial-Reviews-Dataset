Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i'm disappointed. The movie is nice but there are a lot of bad scenes... a lot! Leila that flies... and luke is a great character and was put aside...very sad.... i think it's a \\\"nice\\\" movie\\, but it's not a STAR WARS move. Very sad....","true":true}
