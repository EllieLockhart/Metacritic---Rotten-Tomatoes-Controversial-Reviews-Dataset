Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the hell was that madness. As a diehard fan\\, I am utterly disappointed. It took every bit of will power not to walk out of the theater. It is a bad movie. Great acting\\, amazing effects\\, plot went nowhere and contradicted everything before it. It just wasn't star wars!","true":true}
