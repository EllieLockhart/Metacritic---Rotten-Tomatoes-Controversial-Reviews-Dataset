Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was horribly disappointing and destroyed all that came before it in The Force Awakens (a film that really liked). I was shocked at how bad it was and couldn't believe what I was seeing at various points during the movie. I honestly cannot understand why there a so many glowing reviews by the critics. Any true Star Wars fan will be appalled by this film.","true":true}
