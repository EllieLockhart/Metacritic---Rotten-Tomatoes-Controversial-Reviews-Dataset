Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In all honesty the issue I have with the over all reaction to the movie (Not the movie its self) Is that the angry masses effectively give the original trilogy a pass on every point the complain about this move on. By score (4.5 out of 5) Is based more no a simple ideal.\\n\\nIf people say this is a 1 out of 5? Then New Hope is a -1 out of 5. Return is a 0.\\nThis movie is by no means perfect (None of these movies are) The Canto Bright segment is to long and is pointless. There are pointless parts to every movie in star wars. There are parts of the movie that are not explained as well as they should? Ya\\, it's a middle movie. Empire has the same issue.\\n\\nI will give this however.\\n#1: This is the best example of the use of light\/dark in a movie... EVER.\\n#2: It's a damn good looking movie.\\n#3: No\\, the sword (Lightsaber) play is not bad\\, its actually the 2nd best we have ever gotten. And fitting\\, there not suppose to be super polished.\\n#4: Most of the \\\"Plotholes\\\" that people have. Are in fact not plot holes... (There are totally plotholes) But no one ever points at them. Because they are the plot holes that are ALWAYS in star wars.\\n#5: Luke is fantastic in this. This is the best luke. Because ya\\, the Jedi Failed\\, Hard. Luke trying the same thing over again\\, was going to fail.","true":true}
