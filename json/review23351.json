Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! So much fun. If you are fan boy living in your mom's basement you may not like it. The thing is that this movie is for everyone. Now taking the kiddos to see. They will love the Porgs!","true":true}
