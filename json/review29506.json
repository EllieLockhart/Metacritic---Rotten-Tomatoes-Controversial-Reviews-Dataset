Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is the first genuine auteur to be entrusted with directing a Star Wars film since Lucas himself.  Far more ambitious than (and not particularly deferential to) The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi opens up the mythology of the saga in an original and satisfying way. The film is also noticeably more populist in its message than pervious installments; there is indeed a class system in the galaxy\\, war is about profit as well as ideology\\, and The Force cares little for feudal lineages.  The true achievement of this film is to make a forceful case that a sequel trilogy is a viable artistic\\, rather than a purely commercial\\, exercise.","true":true}
