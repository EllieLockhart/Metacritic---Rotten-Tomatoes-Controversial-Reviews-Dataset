Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I so wanted to love this\\, but such a disappointment. Just as I thought the franchise had awakened\\, it died again. Prequel like \\\"comedy\\\"\\, no character development\\, weird decisions with characters. The beginning was good\\, but it lost me.","true":true}
