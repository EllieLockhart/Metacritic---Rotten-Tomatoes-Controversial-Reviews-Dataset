Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated everything about it except the hyperspace-jump kamikaze attack\\, which arguably breaks both hyperspace and space battle in general.
