Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is easily one of the best Star Wars films. I am not going to lie...it didn't meet the expectations I had going in. But in retrospect\\, I'm glad. The movie told a meaningful story with a lot of misdirection that left us all with simple truths and a conclusion to a broken past. Yoda and Rose put it best...Failure is the courageous teacher and the light will win by protecting what we love. Rey learned of the Jedi's failure from Luke and the last example he left when facing \\\"the entire First Order with a laser sword\\\" to help the Rebels escape. As the student Rey becomes the Master\\, Finn learns courage\\, and Poe learns leadership\\, there is actual hope for the light to prevail. It's not by continued violent heroics\\, epic lightsaber duels\\, running away from your problems\\, or cool new Space Fighters. These violent ways just beget more violence and darkness dead bodies that leaves room for baddies like Snoke and Kyle to claim ruined power and for thieves like DJ to make a buck. The past fear\\, anger\\, hate\\, and suffering might actually be dead. There may actually be room for courage\\, peace\\, love\\, and flourishing in the galaxy far\\, far away that we love. Maybe we too can learn from it. i can't wait to see how it all plays out.","true":true}
