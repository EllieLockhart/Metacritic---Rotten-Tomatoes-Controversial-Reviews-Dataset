Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The saga moves on for new characters Rey\\, FN-2187\\, Poe\\, and BB-8\\, with their desperate fight against the ever encroaching First Order and Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo with just a little slower pacing than Ep.VII.  The slower pacing works to Ep.VIII's advantage\\, giving the film better time to introduce new perceptions and explain the different sides of various arguments.  Deeper explanations and better arguments are what give this film its own position in the Star Wars series.  The Resistance is at a tipping point and the threat of their total demise looms.  All hope is not lost as the previous generation of Skywalkers showcase their skills\\, as Luke better elaborates on the Force\\, and Leia and her people\\, including newcomer Admiral Holdo\\, get to show how to make and implement military plans.  The new generation is joined by Resistance maintenance worker Rose\\, and they all step up with the best of their abilities\\, learning as they progress.  It's great to see that even though some of these new characters are highly skilled\\, they can still make mistakes\\, learn from them\\, and apply their learning.  Basic elements of design and color theory are applied smartly and work into the whole story so that they never feel forced or intrusive; and done effectively enough they appear practically subconscious.  Elements of the Light and the Dark\\, revelation and mystery\\, play out thematically in the plot\\, with spots of red threatening to envelop everyone.    Answers to some mysteries are revealed\\, but since the Dark Side shadows everything it touches and is still strong\\, we can't know if the information from Dark Side users is true.  Lightsaber battles and the use of the Force are done imaginatively.  Use of the Force in a battle is some of the best shown outside of the CLONE WARS and REBELS cartoon series.  There's a few moments of goofy\\, weird\\, and uncomfortable humor\\, and most surprising of all\\, Luke finally gets to tell some peculiar hermit jokes.  As big as this movie is with its budget\\, it has a minimalist feel exemplified by ships flying through the void of space\\, a single man living off what's provided on a single island\\, to combat on the stark flats of a planet\\, to the unadorned chambers of the First Order Supreme Leader.  The minimalism gives an impactful feel that plays great in every scenario.","true":true}
