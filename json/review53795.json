Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grew up on Star Wars in the 80s and expected this episode to be raw like.the last. It was not.\\n\\nFirst the uncharacteristic aspects of the movie that did not sit well when looking at the Star Wars anthology. The overuse of light slapstick comedy detracted from the storyline. The easy and quick deaths of Snoke and Phasma were disappointing due to the buildup of both characters since the last movie. Benicio's character could have been further developed instead of having a Disney Alladin villain feel. The casino planet reminded me of the overuse of cheesy characters and scenes in the prequel movies. Superman Leia flying through space seemed out of place for a Star Wars movie. Ren\/Rey telepathic FaceTime was exaggerated and felt forced after a while. \\n\\nLoved several aspects of the movie. Rebellion captain\\, Rose and her sister were bad ass. However\\, Rose disrupting Finn's attempt to fly into the cannon\\, took away from maybe the most powerful scene in the movie. Luke's hermit ways and then coming back to kick ass via transcendental meditation. Rey\/Ren battling Snoke guards. The salt battle scene was amazing. \\n\\nLeft the theater unsatisfied and longing the raw Star Wars feel that this movie lacked.","true":true}
