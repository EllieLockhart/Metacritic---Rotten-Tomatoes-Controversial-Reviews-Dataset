Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi confirms many Star Wars fans'(including me) worst fears when they heard that the new trilogy would have multiple directors. The entire movie is a mess. A wreck from start to finish. Any and all intrigue that was built up by Abrams is destroyed and thrown to the garbage can by Riann Johnson. The Last Jedi leaves the new trilogy feeling severely disconnected\\, stale\\, and uninteresting as we wait without too much suspense for what now seems to inevitably be a disappointing Episode 9.","true":true}
