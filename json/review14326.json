Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with the original trilogy. After  an initial 32 year waiting to see luke and getting ripped off by force awakens\\, then another two to see him in his full glory\\, we get the last jedi. not only were there no big space battles\\, let a lone a bona fides lightsaber fight or two\\, but luke is\\, to put it too politely\\, underwhelming. This movie elevated the prequels\\, and vaulted return of the jedi to the best one of the eight episodes simply because of the missed opportunity with luke. what a shame. it did have some good individual moments and a good soundtrack. my interest in episode iX & beyond is minimal because of this movie.","true":true}
