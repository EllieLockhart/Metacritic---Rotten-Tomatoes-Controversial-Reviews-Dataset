Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a critic of \\\"Force Awakens\\\"\\, I set the bar low for \\\"Last Jedi\\\". This was in spite of the enjoyable spin-off story \\\"Rogue One\\\"\\, as it takes place in a different era in the timeline. While Rogue One succeeded in merging the prequels and original trilogy effectively with the current visual standard\\, Last Jedi keeps the atmosphere of the older movies\\, while\\, for the first time I would argue\\, begins to create a new Star Wars of its own- and this is a very important thing.\\n\tMy criticism for the expanded Star Wars movies is not as strong as Force Awakens\\, but there are elements of weakness\\, nonetheless. With the amount of lore and material\\, within the movies alone\\, one would expect more connection to ideas and figures that have become staples to the franchise. This shallowness is clear as Luke explains the Force to Rey- the Force is as much talked about as any other thing in Star Wars\\, and yet his explanation comes off as rather vague\\, and honestly not very helpful. This is just one example of many wherein The Last Jedi feels disconnected to all the other movies\\, especially with the older characters. There are narrative decisions\\, like in Force Awakens\\, that I don't agree with as well\\, which also stem from a sort of ignorance to see the connected thread and legacy of characters\/ideas throughout all of the movies. It seems only natural that this would occur without the oversight of George Lucas\\, and his understanding of a saga-length story.\\n\tWhat's changed for me\\, critically\\, is the characters. Most of the annoyances and awkwardness of the new cast have vanished in Last Jedi. There is a little bit of development and growth shown\\, and a sense of confidence in each one. There were even newer characters introduced that felt unique and interesting. And on the subject of new\\, a couple new planets were introduced that also felt engaging and not a rehash of what has been seen before. The visuals and battle sequences also felt more gripping than in past movies\\, if that's possible. One scene in particular at the beginning of the movie shows the barrage of and explosion of a ship at a near 180 degree camera shot- which is uncharacteristic in these movies as space combat sequences typically move quickly from shot to shot. Something as simple as this though is a breath of fresh air.\\n\tAs a star Wars movie\\, I would rate this 4\/5 but as a regular movie\\, there is a lot to like (and a lot crammed into the 2.5 hour runtime). Like it or not\\, this is becoming a new kind of Star Wars\\, largely without the tons of material already written to shape it. I still feel there is a lot of potential that is going untouched. But they seem to be doing a good job with what they've decided to do\\, and that can't be faulted.","true":true}
