Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"R.I.P. Star Wars.  This garbage is something else. The \\\"How It Should Have Ended\\\" parody is going to be 45 seconds long and it will capture everything wrong with this movie.  And that doesn't even take into consideration the way this movie burned George Lucas' legacy and his characters to the ground.","true":true}
