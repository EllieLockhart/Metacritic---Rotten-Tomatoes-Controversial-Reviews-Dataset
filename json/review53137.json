Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome to see that Rian Johnson took some risks with The Last Jedi. He created a film full of surprises and expanded the possibilities of the Star Wars lore\\, especially how he displays the force throughout the film. Although some choices will leave some fans in the blue. I think it is brave that the Last Jedi steers the Star Wars story into new territory where even the fans don't know what the next instalment is going to bring.","true":true}
