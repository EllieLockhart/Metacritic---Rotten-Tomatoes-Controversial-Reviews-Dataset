Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Empire Strikes back\\, this is not.  Not even in the same league.  The movie just felt so disconnected from Star Wars lore.  Luke personified the \\\"Grumpy Old Man\\\" trope.  Rey was underdeveloped but continues the path of a Mary Sue.  The Rose\/Finn\/Poe sub-plot was time that could have been spent developing Luke\/Rey or Kylo\/Snoke.  Speaking of Snoke\\, he amounted to a throwaway character.  No development\\, no back story.  He just rose to power out of nowhere and nowhere is where he ended up.  This is the first Star Wars episode that didn't have a Light Saber duel.  This movie was such a disappointment riddled with plot holes and wasted opportunity.  Nothing from The Force Awakens was answered.  It's as if Rian Johnson wanted to reboot the trilogy after Episode VII.","true":true}
