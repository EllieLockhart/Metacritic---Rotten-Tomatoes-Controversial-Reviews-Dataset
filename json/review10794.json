Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the worst Star Wars movie. Whatever Rian Johnson was thinking when he made this movie is beyond disturbing. He needs a few lessons in common sense of how space works. Bombing runs straight out of WW2 movies\\, but in space? There's no gravity in space. Blaster cannons affected by gravity? in space? Absolutely terrible.\\n\\nThe whole casino planet? Remove that from the movie and you lose nothing importing to do with the plot. You can literally cut 80% of the scenes out of this movie and still lose no plot important scenes.\\n\\nIf Rian Johnson is ever allowed to touch Star Wars again\\, it'll be Disney biggest mistake since not bringing George Lucas in when they started making the trilogy.","true":true}
