Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had SUCH HIGH HOPES for this turd sandwich of a movie. The first scene is actually pretty good but after that it goes down like the Titanic. Plot holes abound\\, character development stinks\\, forced humor and really just bad acting. Laura Dern was such a bad choice! Even Benicia Del Toro\\, who I otherwise think is great\\, wasn\u2019t right for the role. I honestly think that Disney paid off all of the people who saw early screenings! They knew they had an awful film and are trying to squeeze out every dime they can before people start reading honest reviews like this one. I have waited in line on opening night for every star wars film since they rereleased the originals in theaters. I won\u2019t be next time.","true":true}
