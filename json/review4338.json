Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can\u2019t believe they thought this was going to be good. So much wrong with this\\, felt like Space Balls more then Star Wars. Corny\\, cheesy forced jokes and bad comedy\\, average action and next to no real storyline. I don\u2019t feel the writers moved this saga along or even developed characters. It felt like a TV series episode\\, like they didn\u2019t have enough time so they just went for money shot moments and didn\u2019t explain anything. Without trying to spoil anything what I believe was the plot was the slowest paced outer space chase in history of cinematography. Whole you kept waiting for something to happen it never did. Too the younger kids out there joining Star Wars now\\, do yourself a favor and watch episodes 4-5-6 and leave it at that. ","true":true}
