Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow what a disappointment. This movie missed on every beat. It's like Rian Johnson never watched a Star Wars movie before. SW has always had it's \\\"straight men\\\" and it's \\\"funny men\\,\\\" but the cornball attempt at comedy by straight-men during moments of tension just reeks of Marvel formula seeping into the SW universe. And say what you want about Lucas' dialogue that was never written to be spoken\\, but not only is the dialogue here also terrible but the characters have lost any sense of regal-ness or gravitas. Luke is apparently a Master-in-name-only; the character is allowed no acquired wisdom in the time since ROTJ. What an ignoble treatment by the creative team of a fan favorite character. Apparently he still needs the ghost of Yoda to open his eyes to motivational poster level nuggets of wisdom. Even the whole plot device propelling the main narrative-Resistance fleet running from a First Order fleet at medium speed for 2 hours-is lazy at best and full of plot holes. Add Finn's boring MacGuffin storyline and you get a real stinker. Unless you're a hardcore fan who needs to see it for his\/her self to believe\\, wait for this one to go streaming and save your money.","true":true}
