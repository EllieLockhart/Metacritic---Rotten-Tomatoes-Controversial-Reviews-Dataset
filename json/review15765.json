Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this Star Wars movie. Although it does have its flaws they don\u2019t take away from this movie\u2019s overall success. Never have I ever seen Star Wars take so many unexpected turns and take a more darker route than we are use to which is why The Last Jedi has a very high rating for me. ","true":true}
