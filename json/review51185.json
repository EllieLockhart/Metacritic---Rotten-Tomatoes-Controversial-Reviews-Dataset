Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it! I felt this had everything\\, actual star wars\\, human weakness\\, love\\, tension and satisfaction. There were funny moments\\, touching moments and porgs! I cannot wait to see it again! This is definately my favorite in all the series so far.","true":true}
