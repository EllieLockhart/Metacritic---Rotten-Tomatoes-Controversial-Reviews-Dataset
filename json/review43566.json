Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was like Star Wars therapy and that's why a lot of fans didn't like it. It killed their childhoods\\, asked them to grow up. Woops...\\n\\nThe fact is that it's the second best Star Wars movie ever\\, right behind Empire.","true":true}
