Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is simply nothing special about this movie.  In fact\\, I believe it's done more to damage the saga than develop it.  Acknowledging the how ever many hundreds of millions of dollars spent on its production and the several years devoted to its cultivation\\, I find it deeply disappointing that this was the result.  I am not a Star Wars fanatic\\, but it doesn't take an expert to see the irreparable damage caused by this movie.  Take the light speed scene\\, for example.  (Spoilers ahead)  If driving a ship through another at light speed decimates it\\, then that tactic is now a plausible end to any space battle.  If it was possible to do such a thing\\, then why did Luke Skywalker go through all that nonsense with shooting the Death Star in its one penetrable spot?  Why not just get a giant heap of metal\\, or even just an old\\, large ship\\, strap a light speed engine on it\\, and then propel it through the Death Star's cannon?  Indeed\\, if nothing could stop a force at such speed\\, there is no ship that is now safe in the entire universe.  Hence forth there will be no space battle in Star Wars within which the audience will not simply surmise that the protagonists fly a ship\\, at a light speed\\, through that of their adversaries.  The entire saga is now tied down to that simple change.  That is the legacy of this film; bad writing.","true":true}
