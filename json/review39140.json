Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This disorganized mess of a film was a waste of good popcorn. It felt like I was simultaneously watching 3 completely separate but equally terrible movies. This film just won't die either. At every dramatic standoff after the first 90 minutes you're just praying that sweet relief will come in the form of ending credits\\, but it won't. By the 3rd \\\"final showdown\\\" you're cursing the never ending stream of deus ex machinas and yelling \\\"just let them all die\\\" in a crowded theater. This film introduces annoying characters just to kill them off\\, as if that's supposed to make it OK. If you find yourself writing \\\"Leia uses the force to glide like Mary Poppins through space\\\" it's time to find a new line of work.","true":true}
