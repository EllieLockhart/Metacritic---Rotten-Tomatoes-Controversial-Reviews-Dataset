Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insulting\\, disappointing hodgepodge of specialeffects on steriods overshadowing a lack of pkot line and charater development.  Nonrising action denoument etc as classical rules for telling a good story or  kicked to the siproad in the service of an assaultive barrage of unnecessary overblown scenes diminishingnthe art of story telling.  A true waste of  an opportunity and another dissapointment for long term fans pf the original films.  The film was no different from the previews for the next installment of Avengers\\, Jurrasic Park\\, and Guardians of the Galaxy\\, which seem to be collectively melding into fast food for a six year pld mentality.  Sadly\\, a waste of funds and space.","true":true}
