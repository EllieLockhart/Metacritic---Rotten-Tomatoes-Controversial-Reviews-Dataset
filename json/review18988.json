Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's cliched\\, it's derivative and its way too long. The cast is totally unlikeable\\, the acting stilted and plot plausibility nonexistent. It's a horrible mess which I wish I hadn't wasted money on. My biggest disappointment in this film is that more of the main cast weren't reduced to ashes during the 130 minutes plus.","true":true}
