Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to those giving this movie half a star or 1 star. This is a fantastically made film and a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. Is it perfect? No. The second act drags\\, one of the plotlines is boring\\, the porgs are clearly a cynical marketing\/merchandise tool and there is a certain \\\"deus ex machina\\\" quality to some events. But there is so much to love here - the cinematography\\, the character development\\, the practical effects\\, the battles and the twists are all second-to-none. I don't think I've been this surprised and this engaged with a Star Wars film since Episode V. The thing that really makes this movie a 4.5 star\\, rather than just a 4 star\\, however\\, is the risks it takes; it assumes the audience has a modicum of intelligence; it writes its main characters as realistic people with hopes and fears; in one scene especially\\, it explores the psyche of a character and the influence that their weaknesses have over them. Best of all for a Star Wars film\\, it's different. If you love Star Wars\\, go see it with an open mind. If you love movies\\, you won't be disappointed.","true":true}
