Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring. Flat. No magic in this episode.\\n\\nI am really glad that Rey is the central character and Daisy is awesome playing her. I really like Luke (except how he is in this episode) and Hamill is awesome. But both of these characters were given a bad script and bad direction. I blame Rian Johnson for writing and directing a boring and unbelieveable story: bombs in space; Leia not dying immediately in space; Finn's suicide mission that wouldn't have changed anything if he'd pulled it off; Luke being weak\\, grumpy\\, and afraid rather than the fearless\\, wise\\, ready for action Luke in all previous episodes; the running out of fuel set up...\\n\\nI'm glad there is more diversity in episodes VII and VIII\\, hoping that more leading women and people of color are added to the franchise; especially during this period in US history that is being lead by rich\\, old\\, racist\\, misogynist\\, white men following a con man (\\\"he who shall not be named\\\").\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, this movie is boring. With such great characters given such bad writing and direction\\, I just didn't care about the characters I love from previous episode(s): Rey\\, Leia\\, Luke\\, BB-8\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Kylo\\, Maz\\, Snoke\\, C3PO\\, R2D2...\\n\\nI'm hoping JJ Abrams can bring the mystery and magic back in episode IX. As others have said\\, \\\"JJ\\, you're our only hope.\\\"\\n\\nI'm sad that Rian Johnson is writing the next trilogy\\, one that I will not waste my time watching in the theatre.","true":true}
