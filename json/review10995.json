Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having watched this movie many\\, many times\\, all I can say is I think this really missed a lot of marks. (SPOILERS AHEAD)\\, Again Disney I think played it too safe as it felt like a recycled Empire Strikes Back\\, but poorly done. The majority of the film is the slowest \\\"chase sequence\\\" I think I have ever seen. We don't need a forced romance story\\, if it is going to happen it needs to feel organic. The entire Casino side track mission was completely irrelevant to the plot. That makes up what feels like a quarter of the film\\, and if you cut it out the story does not change at all. I think there were a lot of missed opportunities to subvert fan expectations that could have lead to more in depth character development. and Lastly\\, I think Director Rian Johnson took a risk with Luke's story arc which lead him to force feed viewers what he wanted to tell. Instead of earning that story with viewers and having that emotional equity earned for what Luke went through and why he is the way he appears. This just created a very poor cinematic experience for someone who grew up with these films and loves waiting for the story to continue. Though much like The Force Awakens\\, this films visual effects both practical and digital do look spectacular\\, props to those departments.","true":true}
