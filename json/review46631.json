Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too long movie and clearly can see how the franchise just wants to make money by dragging the plot. Won\u2019t see another Star Wars movie again. This is becoming the next pirate of the Caribbean franchise ","true":true}
