Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute masterpiece. Stays true to the Star Wars universe while telling the tightest story any Star Wars film ever has. Movies are supposed to make you feel like their world matters and the stakes matter. This one succeeds. ","true":true}
