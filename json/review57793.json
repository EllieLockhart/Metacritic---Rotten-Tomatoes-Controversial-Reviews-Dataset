Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too long\\, too many subplots that did nothing for character development or plot\\, too many characters\\, Luke and Leia are written poorly and unrecognizable from previous films. Hokey and lame at times\\, excellent and riveting at others. Mostly just a poorer rehash of Empire and Return in feel.\\n\\nIt is almost impossible to care about any character on screen\\, they are all so dull. Ray is promising\\, but underdeveloped\\, almost all characters are underdeveloped\\, or entirely not developed. A sloppy film with too much in it\\, and little of it good - The best may be the big climax scene with Kylo and Ray\\, but perhaps even better is Benicio Del Toro\\, though sadly\\, there wasnt enough of him.\\n\\nThere is some good stuff in here\\, but most of it is disappointing. Like something great that just tries WAY WAY too hard and blows it.","true":true}
