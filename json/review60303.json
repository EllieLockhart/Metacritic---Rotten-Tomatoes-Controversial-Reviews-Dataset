I do understand *some* of the hate\\, even though I think a very small amount of it comes from people who have actually played through the game.\r\rThe story skips back and forth a lot\\, to the point where the end product feels a little jumbled. And the pacing in the first half isn't great\\, I was starting to get a little bored before the story dramatically changes gears. And while I don't particularly agree with the notion that the game didn't add enough onto the first game mechanics wise\\, I can understand that some people may have been wanting more new upgrades and weapons then they got. For the most part the game sticks with the same upgrades that were introduced in the first game.\r\rBut simply put\\, I can't think of many revenge stories better told than this one is. Certainly one has never taken advantage of a video game as a storytelling device more effectively. In its opening hours\\, the game gives you incredibly strong motivation to hunt and hurt the villians of the story. Over the course of this 30ish hour game however\\, the lust for revenge and violence ebbs away as you become emotionally invested in the people that are dotted throughout a story\\, and you see how much this journey takes from the people undertaking it. More harrowingly\\, Naughty Dog continually build the people in this journey up as likeable\\, human characters\\, and then tear them away from you in normally senseless and brutal ways; that's the world this game is set in.\r\rPeople who say this story sucks might have missed the point of the first game\\, or simply take issue with the more progressive plot points in the game whether they realise it or not. But every moment in this game is so carefully crafted to lend itself to the story\\, and the acting and animation of everyone in both the cutscenes and the gameplay is beyond incredible. The small comments characters make to themselves or each other which normally mirror what you're thinking continually align yourself with who you're playing as. The high level of quality over everything is so much more than just gud graphics. It's the work of a studio completely devoted to creating an experience where every encounter adds more onto your understanding of these characters as people.\r\rThis game should make you incredibly uncomfortable\\, which I think is the strongest valid reason to not enjoy it. But it should make you feel uncomfortable because you're a human being\\, and it's hard to watch what these human beings are capable of doing to each other. For that and all the reasons above\\, is why I think this game has been an incredible way to cap off this console generation. The controversy will die down as people find other things to complain about\\, but this game is going to be long remembered as the incredible technical and creative feat that it is.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
