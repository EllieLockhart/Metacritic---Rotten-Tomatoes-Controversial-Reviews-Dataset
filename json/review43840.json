Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will be the movie that ruins the entire Star Wars franchise. It was everywhere\\, no continuity with anything true Star Wars.  Force Awakens built up some interesting characters only to all flat here.  We had 20 years of Luke and Leia build-up and we received 1 hour of Luke comedic relief via Marvel movies style and a death that was lame and Leia showed no indication of anything force using (only sensing the force)\\, yet she all the sudden uses this most uber ability ever seen - why wouldn't Palpatine just use this same ability to not be affected by the chamber of doom he was thrown into? Don't waste your money. Snoke was pointless.","true":true}
