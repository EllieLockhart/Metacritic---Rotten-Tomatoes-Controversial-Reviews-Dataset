Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It  seemed like they recycled a recycled movie.  The special effect and music great work. But\\,  no story nothing....but a commercial for toys and action figures. Typical Disney type program.  I love star wars but once i heard Disney took over and the Star Wars series would go right into the toilet.  Do not waste your 15 bucks on ticket wait till it come out on DVD or Cable.  Disappointing but I think since Return of the Jedi they all have gone downhill since then and stopped with Story for CGI and selling toys.","true":true}
