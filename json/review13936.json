Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you can watch a movie in a near vegetative state\\, it's entertaining enough\\, but if you have even an inkling of intelligence then the vast plot holes and terrible writing  and the devolving of beloved past characters will have you in tears by the end\\, and not the good kind\\, and if you have a love for the franchise\\, you may require suicide watch after watching this film eviscerate your childhood.\\n\\nAll in all\\, it is just lazy writing and a complete disregard for the mythos of the universe. The claims of Rey being a Mary Sue are valid. You never feel she is in any danger. She is a master of all and there is no character development or conflict in here for her to overcome. Mary Sues are products of lazy writing and it is hard to be invested in her journey. The Hero's Journey requires conflict with the self. You have none of that here for any of the main characters. You can always count on them to always make the right decision and saving the day. It's sad.","true":true}
