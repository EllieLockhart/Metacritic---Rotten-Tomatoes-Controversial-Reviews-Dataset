Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars movies have always been a bit dumb in many ways\\, but they always maintained a certain gravitas that stemmed from taking themselves seriously. Even the prequels had enough self respect to do this. The Last Jedi does not\\, undercutting almost every serious moment with a winking nod to the audience\\, making sure we don't forget how silly it all is. Frankly it was insulting. Also\\, screw Poe Dameron. Hodo and Leia should have had him executed or at the very least exiled.","true":true}
