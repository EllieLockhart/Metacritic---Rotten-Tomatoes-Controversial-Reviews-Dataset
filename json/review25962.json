Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing short of the best Star Wars film of all time. Where \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" called back to the original trilogy for the sake of nostalgia and foundation\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" calls back to it so as to subvert it. The final product bravely\\, daringly challenges its own franchise and refuses to pander to audience demands of a Hollywood-typical blockbuster\\, instead delivering grippingly resonant writing\\, thrillingly emotional action\\, and jaw-droppingly outstanding moments that genuinely surprised and amazed me in ways most movies don't. This may not be the Star Wars movie purists wanted\\, but it's the one the franchise\\, and ultimately everyone\\, needed.","true":true}
