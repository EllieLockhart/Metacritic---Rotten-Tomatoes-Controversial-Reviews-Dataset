Shooting and Fire kills don't contribute to anything beyond the aesthetic reach that looks very good on my PS4 SLIM. Hiding behind covers is still imperfect as to review what causes and fits of fury\\, even at normal difficulty levels. The worst aspect\\, however\\, is the story. We had a free mature story and got revenge stories and ambiguously apply that undermines everything we did. I think the imperfect game is not a delight\\, because it is simply cut. Graphics refreshing And at least the usual plot digested the fact that I had to skim the limping mechanics through available to unsatisfactory ending. I had the impression that I was playing Call of Duty with craft. The game has a lot of scripts and requires specific behavior from cb. I felt like having sex with a girl who's got a lot of virginity who behave her because it's their first time. And even being somewhat experienced\\, we come to the conclusion that she is active herself was not pleasant as I finished the challenge undermined the sense of all theoretical fun.\r\rSorry for my bad english.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
