Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disrespectful to the fans\\, I wish there were negative stars....\\n\\nWorst Star Wars movie in the franchise by far. What the absolute F was Rian Johnson thinking. I hope he doesn't get to keep his trilogy.","true":true}
