Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not my favorite Star Wars movie\\, but very good. The acting was amazing\\, as were the effects and music\\, and the character development was spectacular. There was one arc going on that I felt was pretty useless\\, but overall it is a very enjoyable film.","true":true}
