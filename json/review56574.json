Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a mixed bag. i was wondering how much i was going to like this movie when the first thirty minutes didn't feel right to me. It wasn't until a specific point in the movie where I felt the direction was unique and a good change of pace. for the most part\\, I like how some shots were created and the cinematography was some of the best I had ever seen from a Star Wars movie. Though\\, I can't help but overlook the flaws this film had with its characters and how the story was told. At it's best the film builds up anticipating moments with underwhelming twists and reveals. At its worst it ruins a serious moment by throwing in an unnecessary joke. It's weaknesses overshadow its strengths and those weaknesses hurt the film as a whole. I liked The Force Awakens and I really wanted to like this movie\\, but sadly all I was left with was feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. 2.5\/5.","true":true}
