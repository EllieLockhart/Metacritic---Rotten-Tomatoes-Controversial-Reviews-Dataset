{"101487":156611,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS: Every moment of this film is bold\\, leaving no room for middling opinions. This film is so surprisingly divisive because there's no safe formula to lean back on when things get crazy. And things do get crazy. I love most of it\\, and even the things I dislike I can still appreciate for being so ambitious in a mainstream big-budget-blockbuster movie. The things I dislike I'm even coming around to after repeated viewings and meditations. There are many moments that are better than anything else in the saga. Every scene\\, every set-piece is made with such clear love of the lore\\, with all of its weirdness. Anyone who was worried about the Porgs can rest easy\\, they are much less in the way than Ewoks. They only ever have a quick couple of asides\\, then we're right back to the action. If this really is the direction that Disney\/Lucasfilm wants to take Star Wars' future\\, I am all in.\\n\\nSPOILERS: The only things that didn't really do it for me were Superman Leia and Holdo's characterisation. I understand that her contentiousness as an authority figure was an important dynamic for Poe to learn from\\, but we needed a reason that she wasn't telling her plan to anyone. I think it would've even added more tension if the audience is told that Holdo had a better plan in motion that was being destroyed by Poe and Finn's plan. Whether she believed there was a mole\\, or she had the same \\\"need-to-know\\\" logic as Poe had\\, we needed a line in there to explain her unwillingness to tell the Resistance what her plan was.\\n\\nSuperman Leia I think is a good idea in premise\\, but the execution looked a little silly. The music was absolutely outstanding in this moment\\, so I'm sure it will become more forgivable on rewatch.\\n\\nSpeaking of music\\, my favourite part of the movie was the Millenium Falcon chase through the salt caves on Crait. That was the best use of that classic Falcon theme in the entire saga. It feels like a rollercoaster ride to watch every time.\\n\\nCanto Bight is mixed for me. I love it\\, but at the same time there are parts where the tension of the Resistance's situation isn't quite felt by Finn and Rose's detour.\\n\\nFinn and Rose... Finn was definitely not interested when Rose kissed him. I hope that's dealt with appropriately in IX.\\n\\nThe Knights of Ren are forgivably absent in this film\\, but I hope they are major players in IX.\\n\\nThe humour is hit and miss\\, but mostly hit for me. I wish Luke throwing the lightsaber wasn't played as much for laughs\\, but the interplay between Poe and Hux was brilliant.\\n\\nPhasma apparently has a deleted scene where she shoots a group of Stormtroopers so that she can try to escape. I'm very disappointed this was cut\\, it would have framed her character very well. I hope that the CGI was completed on this scene\\, because I'll definitely be reintergrating it in my copy.\\n\\nKylo Ren is perfect. He and Rey continue to be the shining stars of this trilogy.\\n\\nSnoke was a very obvious weak link in The Force Awakens\\, so I'm glad Johnson recognised this and dealt accordingly in what was in my opinion the best way possible. I'm slightly disappointed by the lack of even a simple backstory for him. Just something to explain the gap in the timeline where he was apparently not doing anything\\, then suddenly became involved in this group of characters; would've been nice\\, but I'd much prefer just getting rid of him. And Johnson did so in a way that made Kylo Ren even more compelling. Brilliant.\\n\\nThrow your expectations out the window. You won't need them\\, and looking at all the butt-hurt negative reviews that are disappointed because their Snoke and Rey theories aren't correct\\, you won't want them.\\n\\nCharacter and themes take the forefront here\\, every movement of the plot is designed to help our main characters learn the lessons they need to propel them to where they need to be in IX. Every scene just felt like pure Star Wars. Dialled up to 11.\\n\\nIt's the near-perfect middle chapter for this trilogy\\, and the closest to perfection Star Wars has gotten since 1980.\\n\\nFinal Grade: 8.9\/10\\n(The Force Awakens: 8.3\/10\\, Rogue One: 7.2\/10)","true":true}
