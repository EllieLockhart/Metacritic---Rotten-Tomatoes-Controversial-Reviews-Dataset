Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s Star Wars! There are some new things I saw in this movie! Some great\\, Some fantastic\\, some I scratch my head at. Overall I enjoyed it! I wish some things were different. ","true":true}
