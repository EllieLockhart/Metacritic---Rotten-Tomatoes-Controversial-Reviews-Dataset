Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Time spent on things that didn't matter like milking hairless bears. Not enough time on the characters we wanted to know better. Plot holes. Discombobulated. I have never said \\\"what?\\\" To myself more times than I did during the viewing of this film. I couldn't wait until it ended.","true":true}
