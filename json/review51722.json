Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a disgrace of a movie. Rian Johnson totally betrayed Luke's character so maniacally\\, the only possibility is that he did it on purpose just so people would always remember his name and talk about him for years to come. Terrible fuckin movie.","true":true}
