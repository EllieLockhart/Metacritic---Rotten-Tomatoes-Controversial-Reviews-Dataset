Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my god. Please\\, please\\, please - if you are sending social message\\, make it likable - a brief appearance of Mark Hamill had more class\\, that all other actors combined. And mainly - this movie is pointless. Essentially nothing that happened in it means anything for the story.","true":true}
