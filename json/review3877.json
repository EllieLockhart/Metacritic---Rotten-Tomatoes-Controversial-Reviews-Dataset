Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold and beautiful\\, fans ar doing so much damage to the franchise  by  hating on this movie because they were expecting something more familiar\\, (like rogue one) being disapointed because you expect something from the expanded universe or something more familiar is not \\\" bad writing\\\"  . If this movie has a flaw\\, that's not the one. I Wasn't a fan of the forced humour\\, but it did work at times and the Canto Bight secuence went for too long\\, but for those flaws\\, the ultra stylized refernces to the original Kurasawa movies and the buddhist approach to the force made a complete circle for me\\, fans tend to forget that the core lore of the starwars saga had a cinematic has a cinematic inspiration\\, the power from Luke comes from his determination to finally find the balance of the dark side and the light within him and accepting the failure of his actions\\, not from wielding his sword.","true":true}
