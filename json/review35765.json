Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is evidence that Rian Johnson was clearly out of his depth and was simply unprepared to film a movie that would pay homage to and give Star Wars fans what they want. The green milk scene was awkward and unnecessary while the space race horse scene was horribly stupid and seemed like an after school special. Luke dying as a mirage a planet away was the biggest letdown ever for such an epic character who could have wowed the audience. Totally uncharacteristic of what he would actually do because Luke was never a coward and would never become a hermit like Obi Wan. He would go all in. Rian Johnson as a director was completely unprepared for the massive undertaking of filming a Star Wars film despite having filmed the epic Looper. ","true":true}
