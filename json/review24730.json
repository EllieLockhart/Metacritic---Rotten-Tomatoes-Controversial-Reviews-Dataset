Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mr. Johnson\\, really did not deliver what the fans wanted. It was not a bad movie\\, but not\\, a great one. Mr. Johnson ignored or dismissed all the questions we wanted\\, and added the unneeded and unnecessary.  Mr. Abrams is going to have a very difficult time putting the pieces back together again\\, for the next saga film. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH HIM.","true":true}
