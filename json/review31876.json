Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler alert\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nTLJ wasn't a bad movie. It just had many hiccups which broke the illusion and went against things we knew from before. So the first of these are obviously the forced jokes; they put as many jokes as possible in the movie and a lot of them felt really 'forced'\\, kinda like in a marvel movie (cause the jokes fit in those movies as they happen around the same time we live in)\\, and that made it look like a sequel to GotG. A bad one. Second\\, i know luke has seen some shit in his life\\, but would a character who refused to kill his estranged\\, psychopatic\\, power hungry murdering father\\, even though he only knew him for like a few years\\, even THINK about killing his nephew who he 'suspects' to one day kill his academy. They just turned luke into a 'im getting too old for this shit character'. Third\\, how dafuq does luke create a mind projection which wields a fully functional lightsaber\\, and why does that kill him. And fourth...oh fourth...Arsenal. FIFTH\\, the finn and rose subplot was unnecessary and useless. They never actually accomplish anything and they meet in a cliche way. And sixth\\, the retarded character that is rose\\, whom i hate more than jar jar or that cringy alien singer with angelina jolie lips\\, she ruins what was supposed to be the best part of the movie\\, finn's sacrifice. I mean that shit was independence day kind of awesome\\, how he went straight for the mini death star cannon in a last ditch effort to achieve something in the fight. I mean\\, when the real death star blew up it was like a small supernova. The mini death star blowing up would have for sure destroyed or at least disabled the AT-AT's and the AT-M6's\\, which all contained key figures of the first order\\, and that in fact WOULD be the end of the first order agenda\\, but no\\, rose pushes him out of the way and ruins all hope of victory for the resistance\\, because of 'love'. Bitch you've known him for a day at best. Also\\, too little lightsaber battles. Honestly\\, i enjoyed the prequels(except for most of menace) more than this new sequel trilogy.","true":true}
