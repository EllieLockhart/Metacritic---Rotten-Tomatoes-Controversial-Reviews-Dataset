Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to start off by saying I am a die hard Star Wars Fan. This movie is a disappointment plain and simple for any real fan. Plot development is good\\, but where we seek answers from the last movie into this one we are left with dissapointment. No proper closure. This maybe a great film for those who aren't fan of the series who will see action\\, and comedy. However if you are truly seeking a star wars experience this is not it. I rather live in my fandom universe then the one they presented. ","true":true}
