Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tremenda mierda\\, se pasaron por los huevos todo el concepto de la fuerza y lo valioso del entrenamiento para dominar la fuerza\\, los personajes que forman pilar central de la saga star wars los han mandado al carajo\\, bromas est\u00fapidas hasta el hartazgo.","true":false}
