Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spectacle over substance. This is enjoyable for non-core fans of Star Wars but for those who have been fans since the first trilogy will be disappointed. \\n\\nWasted characters\\, talent and setup.\\n\\nWhile a beautiful looking movie\\, the sub-plots\\, character flaws and continuity errors are distracting for fans of the franchise. Every major promise from the previous movie is thrown away and the space western is turned into a chase movie that should be titled \\\"Space Escape - resistance and sulky old man run away\\\"\\n\\nDisney also continues their approach to dropping a joke a minute in every scene and sequence because\\, apparently\\, that is entertainment now.","true":true}
