Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its the worst Star Wars movie EVER\\, everything is wrong\\, fuck\\, they have managed to make Jar jar a good character in comparisson. I have made my kids watch all the prevoius films (they liked them) and take them to the theater to watch this movie ... this unnecessary long movie ... they now dont want to ever watch an Star Wars movie again\\, you have just lost 3 new fans for your franchise and a veteran one. I no longer care about Star Wars universe anymore because you have fucked up everything.\\n\\nAnd Disney\\, be sure ill make everything in my power to keep my kids away from anything with your logo on it.","true":true}
