{"101487":172546,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TFA had a duty to try to draw in new fans as well as please old ones\\, and it accomplished that duty fairly well. It setup some new characters for new fans to love and still did ok with the original characters. Harrison Ford would not have come back unless he was given a death scene\\, so he got his wish. Carrie was treated well and Mark was left out almost entirely but I wholeheartedly believe that JJ had planned on the next film (Ep 8) to be \\\"Luke's story\\\" and to make up for him having only 10 seconds of screen time in the first movie.  He had setup some decent new characters that could have some amazing backstories explained later and character arcs. Rey was definitely a mary sue\\, but at least Finn was someone with a decent arc to his story. Poe was meant to be disposable but Isaac is just too likable.  So we finally get to Episode 8 and we are dying after waiting 2 years to get payoff's to all the threads that JJ opened up with Snoke\\, the First Order\\, Rey-Finn-Poe and to see Luke get the story he deserved and we had waited decades to see.  What do we get instead?  We get a complete mess of a movie with plot holes that would be expected in a first-time director's indie film but not in the 8th film in one of the largest film franchises in cinema history.  The movie starts out horrible with jokes that don't land\\, a huge plot hole dealing with how gravity works in space\\, and only gets way worse from there.  Finn gets destroyed in this movie\\, despite being the only one of the 3 new characters with an interesting character arc.  He's originally used just as another lame sight gag and joke that fails to land or be funny.  Then he's almost treated like a coward\\, then he goes off on a side-plot with yet another new character\\, which was another huge mistake\\, and the movie then spend a painful amount of time dealing with their side-plot that makes no sense\\, isn't necessary\\, isn't wanted and wasn't even any good.  According to the setup\\, the entirety of what's left of the Republic (which is odd since they were in complete power with peace in the galaxy for 30 years since the end of RotJ\\, yet just because the First Order destroyed 5 planets\\, the entire galaxy is now under heel of a much smaller military force than the Empire was?  Yet\\, with what little the Republic\/Rebellion has left running out of gas out in space\\, waiting to die\\, Finn and Rose have to spend time setting free a bunch of slave animals and would have failed entirely if not for BB-8 who is remarkably capable for a metal ball.  Somehow\\, BB-8 became more baddass than Captain Phasma\\, which is another of the huge mistakes Rian makes in this joke of a movie that he somehow got away with.  Every great character that JJ set up in the first installment of this trilogy was completely screwed over by Rian in TLJ.  Poe looks like a cocky a-hole traitor\\, Finn is played for gags\\, gets tossed on a side quest\\, forced into a love interest after being denied the hero death that everyone else got to have.  All the men are useless and all the women are making the decisions and doing all the \\\"right\\\" things. (along with BB-8)  And I could spend hours on how this movie completely and fundamentally f's up Luke Skywalker.  Decades in the making and Rian Johnson destroys him in just over 2 hours.  Rian repeatedly\\, REPEATEDLY gave the middle finger to long-time fans of the series and the very people that have made it the huge money-maker that it is today.  Luke\\, Leia\\, Admiral Akbar\\, etc were all completely screwed over\\, even the new characters were completely screwed\\, all the great new threads that JJ set up in TFA were just tossed away the same way Luke tosses Anakin's lightsaber over a cliff.  How in the world this movie was ever greenlit and allowed to exist is beyond me.  How the hell is managed to get 91% with critics just shows how corruptable that system obviously is.  Even trying to stand on its own\\, this movie is horrible and full of plot holes\\, jokes that aren't funny and an entire side-plot that makes no sense and yet takes up nearly a third of the movie.  And when placed into the context of being the middle movie of a new trilogy that also exists as part of a galaxy of films that already include two other trilogies\\, then this film is even weaker and falls even harder. I feel sorry for all the fans that Rian screwed over and shattered the hopes of with this laughable excuse for a film.  I also feel sorry for Mark Hamill who was contractually obligated to film this crap and poor Carrie who we won't get to see again and have the ending she deserved.  Kathleen Kenedy needs to be fired\\, Rian needs to keep his incompetent hands out of the Star Wars universe and poor JJ has a lot on his shoulders now to not only somehow fix all that Rian just f'd up\\, but somehow win back the fans that he flipped off in the process.  The Force was NOT with this movie.","true":true}
