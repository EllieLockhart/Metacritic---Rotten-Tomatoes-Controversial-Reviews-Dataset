Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie put out by the franchise by a CLEAR distance! Lacking a decent storyline. Very stale and its difficult to shake to the slow and dreary tone set from the force awakens. The Force Awakens actually left me with abit more hope and the thought that the next movie was going to offer so much more with the introduction to Luke. How wrong I was. For the first time in my life I will not be watching a Star Wars movie at the cinema when episode 9 is released. So MANY things wrong in this movie\\, Rey lacks depth as a character and the whole angle seems forced\\, Leia flying through deep space (WTF)\\, Luke's thought to murder his nephew - Luke Skywalker would never do that\\, and thats to name just a few. Im disgusted that no one told the writer just how absurd this storyline was and allowed him to absoloutely butcher the franchise this way. Nothing about this movie feels like a Star Wars movie. A serious lack of characters and plot leaves ALOT to be desired. The characters of Rey & daffy duck\\, sorry i meant Kylo Ren\\, are NOWHERE near strong enough to carry this Trilogy! And how the critics deem this film in the 90th percentile has absoloutely NOTHING to do the 5 star\\, champagne and caviar red carpet event afforded to them im sure. What a joke.","true":true}
