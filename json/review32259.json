Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Ep. VIII is a disappointing and depressing mess of a movie.\\n\\nAs someone who grew up with the original trilogy this movie just doesn't cut it. It purposefully and unceremoniously deconstructs most of the struggles and character arcs from the originals. Nonsensical plot points\\, silly contrivances\\, awful present day \\\"trendy\\\" humor\\, wasted development opportunities for many characters introduced in Ep. VII\\, the list goes on and on.\\n\\nAnd that brings me to the leftist politics this movie constantly feels the need to beat you over the head with. It goes out of its way to portray men as incompetent\\, cowardly\\, brash and-or evil and women as wise and all powerful\\, same tired old third wave feminist mantra. There's also some anti capitalist undertones. This makes the film feel preachy and sanctimonious as well as distinctly 2015-2017... instead of feeling A long time ago\\, in a galaxy far\\, far away. \\n\\nSad.","true":true}
