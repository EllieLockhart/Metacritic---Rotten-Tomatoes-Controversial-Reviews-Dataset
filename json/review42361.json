Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie tries extremely hard to be original but by doing so destroys the existing characters. Luke Skywalker is a completely different person and it seems at though he learned nothing from his own trilogy\\, The only \\\"good\\\" part of the movie is how it physically looks and sounds.","true":true}
