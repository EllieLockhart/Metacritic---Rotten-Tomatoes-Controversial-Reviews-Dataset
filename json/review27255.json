Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word:  Disaster.  I suspect Rian Johnson to secretely hate Star Wars or to work for WB or to be a Sith.  The choices made are so so wrong. We were all waiting to be surprised. We've been surprised to deeply dislike the movie.   This appart special effects are outstanding. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are outstanding. Poe is the only character which seems right in it. Part of Rey and Kylo are ok. But only parts and that's not ok.  I'm mad and I'm sad.","true":true}
