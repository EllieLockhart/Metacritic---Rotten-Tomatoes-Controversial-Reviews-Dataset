Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No back story for a lot of new characters\\, came across as over excited chaos most of the movie\\, weird dynamics between core characters that had no credibility and saddest of all the kids wanted to go after 20 minutes.","true":true}
