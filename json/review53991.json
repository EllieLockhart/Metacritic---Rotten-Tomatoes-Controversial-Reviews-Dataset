Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so incredibly disappointed in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I wanted to see a dark and disturbing film where our villains (Kylo Ren and Snoke) delve into the dark side deeper than we have seen. Instead\\, we got a wishy washy\\, silly\\, illogical\\, childish\\, and unreasonable movie. Star Wars: The Force Awakens had the perfect exposition for this movie. However\\, The Last Jedi introduced so much more completely unnecessary exposition and left the audience with huge questions about plots in The Force Awakens. There were too many subplots that took away huge amounts of screen time from the true dark vs. light conflict. Speaking of the dark side\\, Kylo Ren's endless internal conflict is exhausting at times. This was supposed to be the movie where he faces self doubt\\, but pushes through it with the tough guidance of Snoke. Kylo Ren was to be a horrible\\, monsterous\\, villain. He killed his father\\, he should have killed his mother\\, and finally\\, he should have killed Luke. He should have severed every tie to the light side so he can descend into a truly dark\\, twisted\\, apprentice. We need to see things become incredibly dark and hopeless before the resolution of the next film. I still like Kylo Ren as a character\\, and I believe Adam Driver does a fantastic job in the role\\, I am just disappointed with how much potential for his character went unused. Also about the dark side\\, there were two evil characters that were killed which turned out to be a complete waste of their potential. I believe Rian Johnson is more concerned about making the movie family friendly and light hearted so he lost sight of what makes Star Wars good. There are countless other issues about the film\\, but in all\\, I am immensely disappointed in The Last Jedi.","true":true}
