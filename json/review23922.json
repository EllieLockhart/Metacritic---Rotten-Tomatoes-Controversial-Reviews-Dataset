Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Make up your mind people. you say you didn't like TFA because it was too much like ANH. and then you say you hate this movie because it's too different? what has the star wars world come to? Anyways\\, I admire the risks Johnson took. overall solid movie. The audience score is just unbelievable. Well what can I say? haters gonna hate.","true":true}
