Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie started with a blast\\, flowed into conflict\\, and ended with heartbreak. Gorgeous visuals and unique writing keep you on the edge of your seat. Personally\\, when Lucas was removed from the director\/writer's seat\\, and it was announced that this would be Star Wars for \\\"a new generation\\\" I thought that The Force Awakens story was going to be much closer in tone with this movie. Instead they played it safe to introduce the characters in the afore-mentioned movie\\, and instead\\, this movie is where the new stuff really comes into play. I can't wait to see where the next adventure takes us as the story narrows in on it's direction towards the end. I will leave my review at that\\, as there are plenty of other extremely lengthy ones already written for this incredible movie\\, and hopefully those whom have yet to see it\\, notice these same wonderfully crafted moments and story-eddies that move through this feature from beginning to end.","true":true}
