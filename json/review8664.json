Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First watch\\, enjoyed it. Then I started to hate it\\, then learned about cinema\\, filmmaking and writing\\, that combined with my vast SW knowledge\\, I loved it. As a movie\\, I just see 2 flaws\\, the way it handles it's politics\\, and the fact that it is not as easy to digest as other SW movies","true":true}
