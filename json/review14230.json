Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it one star for the visuals. It looks great visually. I give it half a star for a couple of scenes that were good.....and that's it. The story generally was not good. The humor was mostly awful and didn't fit the movie.  The new characters were not needed and got in the way of developing the existing ones from the last movie.  As a sequel to episode 7\\, it is miserable. It basically threw away several major developments that 7 was building toward.   I guess you can call those 'surprising twists'\\, in the same way your normally housebroken dog decides to take a huge dump on your living room floor. I think the critics were afraid to be critical because they don't want  to risk being left off the invite list for future  previews\\, gala events\\, etc by Disney.  Extremely disappointing movie given the material they had to work with going in.","true":true}
