Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked this even better than the first in this trilogy! Great battles\\, individual fights\\, lots of good backstories and a wonderful visit to a casino--this delivers!","true":true}
