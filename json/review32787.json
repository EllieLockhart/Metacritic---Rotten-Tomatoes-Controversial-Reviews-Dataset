Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an enjoyable movie to watch. Not only did it keep my attention throughout\\, it kept me glued to the end of my seat. Sure it's not the best Star Wars movie\\, and some scenes were questionable\\, such as the scene where Leia flies through the air like superman\\, but other than that it was a well made movie. I would strongly recommend you to watch it.","true":true}
