Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took my teenaged son to see it\\, and we both loved it. People need to chill and let the screenwriters and directors do their creative jobs instead of vomiting out what viewers think should have happened in SW movies. These new movies are for the new generation. Stop being like Old Luke--curmudgeonly and narrow-minded-- and be a little more like Rey. I really like the direction of these movies. The audience clapped several times\\, so I'm certainly not alone!","true":true}
