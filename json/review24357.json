Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Miserable. Just thinking of this movie makes me angry. I had so much hope going in too. I though The Force Awakens was actually ok\\, but this movie is so bad it even ruins that one as well. If you love Star Wars then for the love of God stay away.","true":true}
