Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was absolutely the worst Star Wars movie.  I thought TFA was bad..  this goes beyond that. So many pointless scenes\\, horrible plots and what they did to Luke Skywalker is pretty painful for 30 to 50 year olds that helped keep this franchise so popular through the decades. Absolutely a punch in the stomach.  Good riddance Disney and Star Wars. Don't care anymore.","true":true}
