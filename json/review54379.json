Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say\\, The Last Jedi is with beyond a doubt the biggest movie let down I've ever experienced. I was really looking forward to a Star Wars movie directed by someone who had worked on some great episodes of Breaking Bad. But from the terrible pacing (1\/3 of the movie could have been cut) to the rehashed story (despite people saying this movie is different\\, it somehow repeats so many beats of Empire down to more evil big empire vs small outnumbered rebellion\\, again) this movie is an uninspired disappointment. This is especially sad in light of Kylo Ren and Poe who push the envelope for new\\, interesting characters in this setting.\\n\\nBut by far what disappoints me\\, even disgusts me about this movie is how it is a huge disservice to the character of Luke Skywalker. If you're looking for the Luke who was unboundlessly optimistic\\, who would never desert his friends\\, and who believed unconditionally in the redemptive power of love\\, you're not going to find him here.\\n\\nLuke and his story have affected me a lot\\, even changed me as a person. And it will always be with me no matter what new movies come out. Too bad Disney didn't think it deserved a worthy continuation.","true":true}
