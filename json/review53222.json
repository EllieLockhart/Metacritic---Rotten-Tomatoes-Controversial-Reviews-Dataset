Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Blame spam bots for low audience score\\, yet they won't blame Dissssney on the tomatometer...Another year\\, another disappointment. Another dragging the characters we loved through the mudd just to kill one off one movie at a time. Plenty of awesome pc stuff checked off\\, so if you don't like this movie you are a racist\\, sexist\\, probably white pleb. The series has basically become the Call of duty for movies....Well actually there are a few others\\, but this one has to be the biggest. The formula for Disney is pretty simple with this... Copy and paste the old movies\\, slap on star wars\\, and the force will be strong with the fanboys... Plenty of boredom\\, plenty of pointless plots. More characters that die off for no good reason. One that goes absolute mary poppins\/jimmy neutron in space status... Oh dont forget our fan favorite MA-REY-SUEEEEE\\, and don't you dare try mansplaining her.","true":true}
