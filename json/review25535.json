Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS: The Last Jedi does not follow the usual Star Wars plot of \\\"blow up the big thing.\\\" There are plenty of unexpected twists and turns that make this story really unique. I was shoveling popcorn in my face at full speed because I was so focused on what was going to happen next. It all leads up to an epic showdown that will leave you talking about it for days.","true":true}
