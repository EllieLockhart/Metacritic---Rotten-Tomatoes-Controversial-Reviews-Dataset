Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined starwars for me. I think of The last jedi and any after it alot like all the bad Terminator movies after the 2nd. I refuse to acknowledge these as in the same universe as the originals\\, or even episode 1-3","true":true}
