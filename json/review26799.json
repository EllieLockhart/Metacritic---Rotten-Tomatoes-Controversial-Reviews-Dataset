Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One and a half stars for the overall amazing visuals. Unfortunately there was nothing else to the movie. Very pointless plot with no cohesion. Subplots that go no where. Focus on characters that serve no purpose. No sense of world building. Corny moments and tone deaf humor. I could go on but I'd rather forget I ever watched this \\\"Star Wars\\\" film. Play KOTOR 1 and 2\\, much better plot\\, characters\\, world building\\, and story telling.","true":true}
