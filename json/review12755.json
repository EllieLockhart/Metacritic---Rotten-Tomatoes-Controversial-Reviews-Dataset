Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created a RT account just to post a bad review for this film. \\n\\n-Tone is completely off. The movie begins with Dameron making a prank call to Hux (seriously).\\n\\n-Who is Rey? Who is Snoke? These are literally the biggest questions of TFA. We know less about Snoke from this film than TFA. Rey is a nobody.\\n\\n-Luke Skywalker ends TFA staring\\, terrified\\, at Rey. This movie begins with him tossing Anakin's saber over his shoulder like he doesn't care\\, and basically drinking blue milk from a teat.\\n\\n-The \\\"save the animals\\\" scene at the casino is ridiculous.\\n\\n-Why didn't the First Order send one ship ahead at light speed and turn around to blast the Resistance cruiser?\\n\\n-Why did Luke not just meet Kylo in person if he was going to die anyway?\\n\\n-Rey is a Jedi after failing one training session.\\n\\nI could go on and on.","true":true}
