Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie\\, and not because it challenged long-standing and deep-rooted Star Wars lore. It was overly silly\\, and wasted 40 minutes on a subplot that amounted to nothing. (Why exactly did Rose and Finn try to dismantle the First Order\u2019s ability to track ships in hyper drive?). It also left too many unexplained transitions between scenes: Rey suddenly finding herself back on the Millennium Falcon (and in good spirits) with Chewy\u2014saving the day with glee\u2014after experiencing an incredibly intense confrontation with Kylo Ren (how did she get out of there and back to support the Rebels?); the First Order\u2019s ability to mount a massive land assault against the Rebels immediately after their fleet was crushed by a Rebel ship in hyper drive; et al. Perhaps most significantly\\, I find myself completely uninterested in the characters and situation they face. No character development\\, no plot advances to speak of\u2014a genuine waste of time. Very\\, very disappointed. ","true":true}
