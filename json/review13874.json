Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If we look at The Last Jedi detached from our feelings on Star Wars and the characters\\, we are still left with a bad movie. It is a poorly executed film on all levels. The plot is rushed and jumbled and there were multiple occurrences where the movie felt that it was at its climax\\, but it kept pushing on. In many ways\\, I felt like I was watching three or four movies hastily pushed into one. The timeline of the movie is confusing as we have the plot with the Resistance fighters and the First Order occurring in the span of 18 hours\\, but these scenes are intercut with Rey and Luke's interactions\\, which clearly take place over several days. When we take into account Rey and Ren's force communications\\, the timeline does not line up. Rey has much more time in her story than the Resistance fighters do\\, but the movie tries to make it appear like the events are occurring simultaneously.  Moreover\\, The Last Jedi takes place practically immediately after the events of The Force Awakens\\, but there is no explanation as to how the First Order regrouped so quickly after the destruction of the Starkiller Base or how Hux\\, Phasma\\, and Kylo Ren managed to survive the destruction of the base\\, as the audience never saw them leave the base in The Force Awakens. While Empire Strikes Back places years in between the events of the preceding movie and itself\\, The Last Jedi forgoes that and ends up leaving many loose ends left loose. \\nThe script is bad. The dialogue is forced and cheesy and feels genuinely out of place from what Star Wars movies have provided in the past. The editing borders on amateur. The special effects are a hot mess from hell. Characters move through the air in ways never shown before in Star Wars and it does not work. It looks cheap\\, it looks like a parody. \\nThe Last Jedi is bad as a movie\\, not just as a Star Wars movie. As a Star Wars fan\\, I felt physically ill watching the film. I nearly walked out several times\\, but stuck around hoping that I would find some small reward for my suffering. I did not. I was pushed to the ground and kicked repeatedly in the stomach by this movie as a fan. As a film student\\, I was shocked by how Disney and Lucasfilm could allow a movie to be so poorly executed.","true":true}
