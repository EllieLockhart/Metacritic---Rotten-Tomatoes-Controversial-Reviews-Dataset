Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie could have been brilliant but instead is complete rubbish.  I cannot believe that anyone involved in the production of this film\\, from the screenwriters to the director to the actors to the producer allowed this to see the light of day.  They must have never have seen a Star Wars film prior to this.  It really belongs in the bin.\\n\\nI did not appreciate the overt liberal tones.  I am as progressive as any millenial\\, but even I thought this was over the top.  It seemed to me that any male character was there only to be restrained and corrected by the females.  And the females were a bit too much too.  Leia can now come back from the dead\\, Rey needs no training in the ways of the Force\\, the new admiral cannot even conceive of sharing her plan with Poe and Finn's sidekick\\, Rose seems to only be there to lecture him on the evils of war and capitalism.  While I love Leia and Rey\\, they were not protrayed appropriately.  The new admiral\\, I was ambivalent about.  And Rose\\, poor Rose\\, she was dreadful...just a dreadful character and actress.\\n\\nI don't have much hope for this franchise.  So much potential wasted and I have lost interest in what is left.","true":true}
