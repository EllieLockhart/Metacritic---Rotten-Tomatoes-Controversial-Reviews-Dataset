Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably the most visually striking film in the canon.  The direction that Rian Johnson took the characters was believable and needed.  Unlike Rogue One where there was little character development\\, this movie spent a great deal of time explaining character motivations.  There were some moments that were unnecessary and some that could have been executed a bit better\\, but overall\\, the story took sharp unexpected turns and never became predictable.  While I understand some fans will dislike this movie\\, I firmly believe that is because they built their own stories in their heads and were disappointed when those theories did not pay off.  This is a great film.....but you will not leave happy.","true":true}
