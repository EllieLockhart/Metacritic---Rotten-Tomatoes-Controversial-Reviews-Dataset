Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie challenged me at several points. I was never sure which way the tide would turn. Being the middle entry in a third trilogy\\, it had to leave room for more. Honestly I hated The Force Awakens due to the way Luke\\, Han and Leia were written. Thankfully\\, this redeemed Luke and Leia!!! I am disappointed with the public reaction as I think this was going in a very interesting and fruitful direction. Sadly this director may not get a chance to guide the next installment. Here\u2019s hoping Disney sticks with him anyway!","true":true}
