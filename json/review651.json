Loved the depth of choice\\, the interesting characters\\, the interloping plot. Was constantly kept on my toes and was genuinely scared at certain points. The butterfly effect and involving the players fears was such a great concept that worked so well\\, when your characters can die from the wrong mistake then the story-line and your involvement mean 100% more than they did in a normal console game.\rThough\\, unfortunately\\, the game wasn't amazing as I thought it would be. (BEGIN SPOILER) the involvement of the supernatural element to the game just lost things for me - it just felt like such a cop out in terms of explaining the mysterious and complex plot. A real life killer is just so much more of a threat\/fear than a spooky mine demon. As soon as that plot point was shown I even found the game to stop being scary. Went from screaming my head off at jump scares and saw-like scenes to not caring about the plot and shrugging when a \\\"scary\\\" demon popped out. (END SPOILER) Was just super disappointed with the main plot-point of the game. If they'd gone with a better ending would have definitely given this a 10\/10\\, and it would have gone down as one of my favourite video games\\, unfortunately that wasn't the case.\r\rAgain\\, worth the buy just due to how amazing the first 80% is\\, the replay-ability\\, the graphics\/characters\/music\/etc. but just a bit a disappointing plot-twist and ending. Could have been amazing but I think it missed the mark\\, unfortunately.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
