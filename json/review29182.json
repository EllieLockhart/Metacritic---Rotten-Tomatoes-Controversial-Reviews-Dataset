Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Regardless of how disappointed I was in the other Star Wars trilogy. (Episode 1-3) I have never fell asleep on a Star Wars movie until this movie. It felt like 4play with no climax whatsoever. This franchise has become a money grabbing embarrassment. The book to any movie is usually better but this is just ridiculous. In fact disney or whoever has the control took some of the most interesting stories and took them out of the cannon. I think I'm done with this. Irritated beyond belief so I know real star wars heads are probably p\/o.","true":true}
