{"101487":197011,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WHY DOES ROTTEN TOMATOES ONLY SHOW POSITIVE AUDIENCE REVIEWS FOR THIS ON THEIR FRONT PAGE WHEN THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWS AFTER THAT ARE MOSTLY NEGATIVE?  Is it because Last Jedi has studio advertising on this site??  Anywat\\,  I think Carrie Fisher saw a rough cut of Last Jedi and died of a broken heart.   Jesus Christ that sucked.  Christmas is already a difficult time of the year and now this?  This is the film they show you while you're waiting in line for the ride at Disneyland.  They were this close to having a shootout at a Taco Bell.  Seriously\\, those sets were from Battlestar Galactica: The Movie\\, right?  With a couple Tempest machines worked in on the sides?  And a story that lurches forward like an episode of Herculoids?  Laura Dern in a her purple Toni?  Everything with the cute alien gophers\\, orphan kids and adorable robots?  So fucking depressing. I think I have a couple leftover Celexa pills in a drawer somewhere.  I now don't respect any of these fucking critics sucking corporate c*ck.  These are the times we are living in.  Everyday this country hits a new low\\, something like this comes along and no one even notices.","true":true}
