Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over all boring with little to no character development. it really seemed that they did try to hide that fact with CGI and effects but failed. At that the story is just the rebels ship very slowly getting away from the first orders ship which conveniently stays the exact right distance away so not to shot out of the sky FOR 18 HOURS. You know just long enough to convince Luke to get off his ass.","true":true}
