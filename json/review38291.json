Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst any fan of Star Wars could\u00e2(TM)ve asked. Pointless plot line for 2\/3 of the movie to attempt character development on uninteresting characters while at the same time disrespecting the characters that made Star Wars what it was. It\u00e2(TM)s clear the director did not give a hoot about world building and continuity even coming off the success of TFA. TFA might as well not even happened as there was literally nothing that ties the two together other than characters and the name Star Wars. This movie had so much potential that was missed entirely due to bad writing and directing. Now this abortion of a film is considered canon\\, great... pumped for episode 9 now \u00f0~'","true":true}
