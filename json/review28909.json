Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed after watching this shambles by Rian Johnson. Understand that the SW saga needs to step away from the Skywalker ethos but the director made a total has if this. After growing up with the original trilogy the ditector here has taken nothing from the previous film in terms of outstanding questions instead putting the middle finger up to the lot of it. Storyline was a joke\\, the jokes\/humour were cringeworthy\\, the characters built up in the TFA have been totally broken down and left devoid of any justice. It is no wonder that Mark Hamill was supposedly not happy with the direction that Luke was scripted.\\n\\nAll i will say is that thank god JJ Abrams is back on the f8nal seauel\\, but he has his work cut out trying to clear up this whole mess that a director such as Rian Johnson should never have been allowed near in the first place","true":true}
