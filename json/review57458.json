Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was perfect. Except for one thing. Total disrespect of Luke Skywalker's story arc. You couldn't have fucked it up more. I bought 25 tickets to this film and brought all my friends. I loved it all... except for the most important part - LUKE and REY training. Luke being who the fuck he really is. Rian Johnson is a brilliant director\\, but Rian Johnson doesn't know who Luke Skywalker is. The team did an amazing job. The film is beautiful. Shot well. New and cool ideas. So much awesome-sauce that is totally forgotten by Luke's story arc.... can we get a redo? This film could have been the best one yet... but I rank this one below the Prequels... cuz some how they are more Star Wars than this film... bc at least Anakin's arc is solid. Luke's arc in this film makes no sense\\, is out of character and turned my childhood hero into a whiny\\, whimpy old man who is committing passive suicide all by himself... who is portrayed as a murderer.... It's a sad day for the republic. Can we get a do over?","true":true}
