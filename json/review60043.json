The gameplay has barely changed in 7 years and I really expected something \\\"next gen\\\" or an evolution at least. It feels tired. I am sure there are people out there who will love it for whatever reasons they want to justify\\, but frankly I can't recommend this one\\, especially if you were a huge fan of the characters in the first game and don't want a story that wants to rub your face in contrivances. I would love to have seen what someone like Amy Hennig could have come up with\\, but it appears Naughty Dog is well past their glory days. Just such a disappointment.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
