Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I've seen the movie only once\\, but like most critics that's all I need to judge it. The major problem with the film\\, for a Star Wars fan like myself\\, is the utter disregard for the rules of the universe established in every other Star Wars movie. For example\\, The \\\"Sound in Space rule\\\" has long been established since the very first film\\, but in the last act of the Last Jedi they throw that simple rule out the window when a huge explosion happens in space. In this moment the film goes silent. Why? Because in real life no sound can travel through space\\, but in the Star Wars universe this is not the case. Never the less the filmmakers of the last Jedi ignore that rule to add the sense of epicenes to the scene. What they fail to realize is that completely contradicts every Star wars film that's come before and essentially belittles Star Wars fans who know this rule. The filmmakers in essence are saying \\\"we know better than you\\\". They know so much more in fact that the procced to add new force powers never before seen and a dead princess Leia\\, floating through space\\, comes back to life and flies back to safety in what is perhaps the biggest \\\"jump the shark\\\" moment in movie history. This would have worked if a prior movie established that the force creates a magical force field around everyone\\, but no such movie exists. A Jedi has no such powers\\, if they did you wouldn't be able to force push them or shoot them with a blaster because they have a magical force field. I could go on and on with the continuity errors in this overlong mess of a film\\, but I'll save you the trouble. Only see this movie from the comfort of home\\, and you should be very drunk while doing so\\, but that's just an opinion from a Star Wars fan. \\nIf you like the review check out my channel on YouTube \\\"Lantern 2814\\\"","true":true}
