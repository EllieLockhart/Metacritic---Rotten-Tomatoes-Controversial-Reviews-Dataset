Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had as many brilliant scenes as boring ones\\, made half of the time no send at all and reduced interesting character scenes from The Force Awakens to pawns on a chessboard. The second half of the movie was much better and the scene between Luke and Kylo was brilliant\\, but all in all something of a letdown.","true":true}
