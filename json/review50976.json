Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage tier movie that did no justice to the legendary start of the sequel movies... unbelievable move on the director's part. Way too much humor in places where it shouldn't be\\, riddled with plot inconsistencies\\, and zero character development. I would suggest not watching this movie\\, as we seem to be almost exactly where we started in the movie. The Disney\/Marvel influence pandering to foreign audiences is palpable\\, and quite detracting from the franchise. This physically pained me to watch one of my favorite take such a hit. Please fire whoever the hell you decided to direct this\\, and bring back the old franchise.","true":true}
