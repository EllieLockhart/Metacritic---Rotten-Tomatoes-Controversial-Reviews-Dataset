Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics were awfully generous with their 90%. In my opinion this is worst movie in the entire franchise. If the title is Star Wars\\, I will not be returning to the theater for anymore disappointment.","true":true}
