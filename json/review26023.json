Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not much of a plot or story line.  Killing off Luke was stupid\\, making him a pansy and not much of a Jedi.  Carrier Fisher was great\\, as always.  It was a bunch of worthless characters.  Next to Jar Jar Binks\\, this was one of the most disappointing Star Wars movies. No real Jedi action either.  Just -- horrible.","true":true}
