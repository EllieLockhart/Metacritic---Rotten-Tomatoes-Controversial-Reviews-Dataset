Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This the worst sequel I have seen to any game\\, and easily the worst Naughty Dog game to date. Whoever calls this game a masterpiece is either being bribed or has zero brain cells. They said most people wouldn\u2019t like this game before it released\\, so then what was the point in spending millions of dollars making a game that you knew would be hated by the fans. Naughty Dog has lost all my repsect and I hope they do not make an Uncharted 5\\, because they would ruin that franchise too. Do not trust people who claim that this is a great game. No wonder over 70% of Naughty Dog\u2019s staff left during development of this game. Do yourself a favor and save your money for games that don\u2019t spit in the faces of its fans. Joel dies 2 hours into the story\\, Ellie turns into an idiot for killing all of Abby\u2019s friends but not killing her just because she gets some irrelevant flashback to Joel playing a guitar\\, and the game tries to make Abby a likeable character even though she kills Joel and Jesse\\, and almost kills Tommy\\, Ellie\\, and Dina. Abby even gets saved by Joel but still kills him\\, and somehow this is a great story to Neil Druckmann\\, which proves that he should be fired.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
