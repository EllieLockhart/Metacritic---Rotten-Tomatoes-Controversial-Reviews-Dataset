Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As i am an evil old white male and i just signed up to this site to rate this movie might tell you it sucks!! Rotten tomatoes should be ashamed also when it is still at 50% when the true math puts it around 22%. Must be the new math to go along with the SJW movie i just watched.","true":true}
