Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Months later and I still can't fathom the absolute destruction of the Story and Trilogy I loved growing up.....in one foul swoop Rian has killed not only this movie but the franchise for me....I have no desire to see another Star Wars or spinoff or Trilogy in the future...Unreal.  This is the SJW PC culture at its best.  Take something great and make it crap because its what Hollywood has become.  A bunch of entitled\\, Rich\\, 1%\\, who point the fingers at other rich 1%.  Hypocrites.","true":true}
