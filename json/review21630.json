Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Joyless film with no understanding of the characters or the universe. Plotholes all over a ridiculous overlong story that wastes so much time with  segments that go no where while not taking any time to resolve any expectations set from the first movie. Heart breakingly bad.","true":true}
