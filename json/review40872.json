Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie could have been so much better. The characters were difficult for me to care about and there were so many unnecessary additions including Rose and the camel-dog-horses arc of the story. It felt like the movie was trying really hard to inject today's politics into the movie. I just wanted to see lightsabers\\, space battles\\, and learn how the Jedi would carry on. To me\\, Rogue One was 10X better in just about every way. See that one instead.","true":true}
