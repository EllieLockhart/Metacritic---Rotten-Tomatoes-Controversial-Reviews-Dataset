Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry but this movie has so much wrong with it that I don't think I cover it all. First of all\\, what they do to the character of Luke Skywalker is outrageous. The whole casino sub plot is a complete waste of time that goes nowhere. Rey defeats a fully trained Jedi Master as well as a force user trained by him without almost any training at all. It makes no sense\\, and neither does the whole rest of the movie. As much as I love Star Wars\\, I'm strongly considering boycotting the future movies until this is fixed if it's fixed at all. So many childhood memories ruined in one foul swoop.","true":true}
