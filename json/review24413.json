Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More challenging than most of the other movies\\, but it's entertaining throughout and it explores concepts and themes that Star Wars hasn't tackled before. Don't believe the angry nerds\\, this is an amazing addition to the series. ","true":true}
