Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was not fully developed for my liking. It seemed that the film was attempting to combine so many undeveloped ideas into the storyline\\, which made the film unenjoyable. Overall this film had potential to be great\\, hopefully the next Star Wars film will have a fully developed plot.","true":true}
