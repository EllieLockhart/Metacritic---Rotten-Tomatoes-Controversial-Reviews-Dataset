Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! Especially on the second view. It's bold\\, takes chances\\, and tried to deliver new tones and views of the force and its users\\, and should be taken as a work of art by an artist\\, not tying to fit into a \\\"Star Wars\\\" style as to rehash old movies again and again. The humor is fun\\, and mostly lands head on\\, and I liked the light hearted fun without going overboard on the \\\"seriousness\\\" but still delivering a ton of things to think about.","true":true}
