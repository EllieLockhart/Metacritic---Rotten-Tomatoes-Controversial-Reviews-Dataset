Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is simply just an all round fun film! It has beutiful action sequencenses and deep character moments. But it does go on too long and the middle of the film drags. Even with that though this is one of my best movie going experiences ever. HIGHLY Recomend","true":true}
