Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor\\, lazy writing. Inconsistent\\, contradictory\\, and ruins the legacy built by the films before it in a weak attempt to be different. This is a movie for small children. It's essentially a 2 1\/2 hour marketing ploy to sell toys. Star Wars is dead to me\\, probably won't even see episode IX","true":true}
