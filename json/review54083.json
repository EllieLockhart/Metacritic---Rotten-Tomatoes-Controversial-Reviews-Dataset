Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd like to say one specific thing\\, do not look at the 'Audience reviews'. My theory is this the hardcore fanboys who have been there since the beginning dreaming to be a Jedi or Sith are unhappy because their theory that they conjured up for the last (2) years to how The Last Jedi should have occurred didn't happen\\, it's not their movie it's those who made Star Wars to begin with\\, it's merely an interpretation of what material they have\\, I'm getting a vibe that they (fanboys) wanted something original but new at the same time but when they got that new thing they aren't happy about it... if we continued with original all the time we'd land up with remakes and nothing to expand the universe\\, people need to understand that these are fantasy movies set in space with only a shred of sci-fi. One person has related this movie to being as bad as the ''Phantom Menace\\\" I did not see Jaja Binks at any stage in The Last Jedi\\, to put it simply the views typed negatively are all considerably biased with very little intelligence expressed as to why the movie was bad.\\n\\nNow that my rant is over\\, I am quite fond of this movie I found it intelligent\\, the way people were connected to others in different universes how it also affected these characters\\, humorous it was indeed\\, the audience erupted with laughter many times and they did so again on my second screening there were some sub-plots that may have been drawn out a bit\\, and a scene that may have pulled on the reality strings a little\\, an epic battle with light sabers not against each other but against unfavourable odds\\, expect twist and turns that have your jaw hit the floor\\, over all an enjoyable experience that pays homage to the originals but also has created foot holds for future developments the wonders of the force are expanding as with this new universe and I welcome the change it is necessity\\, this is my favourite Star Wars\\, I could watch the originals but never understood the hype surrounding them. However with the performances\\, the onset chemistry Daisy Ridley & Adam Driver have is actually quite spectacular these are my favourites in this film & because of them it has lit a spark that has revitalised the whole franchise for me. I recommend you go see it\\, it was worth the wait.\\nTo the fan boys \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" the actors who were originals are old and are passing on the mantle you should probably let that happen also. And it's  the force that chooses you not a Name.","true":true}
