Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly neuters Luke Skywalker and makes everything that came before useless. Seriously\\, he always believed there was good in Vader and finally helped to save his father's soul... but now we find he tried to murder his apprentice because of a bad dream!!! Do what?! Add to that how weak and grumpy and just worthless he is as a Jedi and I'm finally done giving Disney constant passes because I'm a die-hard fan. Someone please buy the rights from Disney and fix this crap like it never existed. Hey\\, if they're going to replace that horrible all-woman\\, man-hating\\, pretend like the originals never existed Ghostbusters film like it itself never existed\\, they MUST do it with this too.","true":true}
