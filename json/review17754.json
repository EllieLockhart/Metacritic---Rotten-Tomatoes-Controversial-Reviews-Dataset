Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u2639\ufe0f. It didn't have to be like this. None of it. So many weird choices. Watch the documentary The Director and the Jedi. It's in the bonus features when you buy it. It's better than the movie. It's beautifully shot and paints a picture of a director that wasn't ready. I feel bad for Rain Johnson. But he should have had help. Being a big fan of the series and a director wasn't enough.","true":true}
