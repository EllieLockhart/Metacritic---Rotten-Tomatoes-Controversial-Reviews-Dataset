Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has had a place in my heart since I first saw the original trilogy. When I was around four or five\\, my dad first introduced me to the Galaxy\\, far\\, far away. Growing up\\, the prequel trilogy was just wrapping up\\, so most of my childhood memories are filled with clone troopers\\, and my endless fantasies of being some sort of commander of the GAR. \\n\\nWell\\, here I am today\\, 19 years old and witnessing a new trilogy\\, one that I may share with my kids someday\\, saying \\\"yeah\\, I lived through that\\,\\\" or something to that effect. As someone who understands nostalgia\\, I understand the varying reactions this film has received up to this point. There are those who believe that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is \\\"not Star Wars\\,\\\" which is totally understandable. It is not. It is not meant to be anyone's Star Wars but its own. If that makes no sense\\, have no fear. I shall further explain it.\\n\\nStar Wars is all about telling a story. Many people find it hard to believe that said story can focus on anything outside of the Skywalker family. That is exactly what The Last Jedi does\\, though. Instead of a continuation of our favorite characters (Luke\\, Han\\, Leia\\, etc.)\\, many ties are cut from the original trilogy\\, which allows a greater understanding of the massive galaxy we learn exists in the prequel trilogy. This is what Star Wars is about\\, in my opinion: exploring the vastness of a Galaxy far\\, far away\\, which The Last Jedi does perfectly.","true":true}
