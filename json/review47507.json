Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What Kathleen Kennedy\/Rian Johnson did to Luke Skywalker was horrible.  That\\, combined with their utter disdain\/derision\/scorn for the LARGE part of the fan base which helped to grow Star Wars into the monster that it has become has\\, in large part\\, caused my decision to not give another penny of my money to the LucasFilm division of Disney until Kathleen Kennedy is no longer involved.  You don't insult me and then expect me to spend any money on your product.","true":true}
