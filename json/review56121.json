Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Speaking as an OG Star Wars fan (I saw it 14 times in 1977)\\, this is a good movie. Characters do unexpected things\\, plans go wrong; it does not end the way you think it will.\\n\\nIt's not a perfect movie; it meanders at points and some scenes go on too long\\, but at no point was my childhood ruined. Pay no attention to the sad fanboys who tender such complaints; these aren't the nerds you're looking for. \\n\\nHonestly\\, I love Star Wars. I've never NOT seen a Star Wars movie in the theater. After a lifetime of 'safe' Star Wars films that took few chances\\, TLJ is a window thrown open in a room full of stale air. Take a deep breath and let the past die.","true":true}
