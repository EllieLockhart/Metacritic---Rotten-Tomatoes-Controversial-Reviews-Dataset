Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers) It has to be one of my least favorite Star Wars films. Yes\\, the visuals\\, acting\\, and music were phenomenal but the story and character actions failed to reach anything close to the Star Wars we knew to love. I\u2019ll just shoot straight: 1) Rey has gone head to head with Kylo Ren twice. WHY IS THIS AN EVEN MATCH?! Kylo has been trained his whole life by THE LUKE SKYWALKER and Ray sold trash\\, but yet she is kicking his butt and crazy strong in the force with 0 training. 2) Vader is the greatest villain of all time\\, and now all we have is Kylo because Snoke was easily slayed.. and he is supposed to be the big villain in episode 9? Of course Rey will win\\, she has already shown she is a million times stronger. 3) Star Wars fans across the globe went to the theater knowing that Luke was going to have an amazing force moment where he kicks butt. And? Yeah\\, he was a ghost.... and literally the force was used to just move some lightsabers and rocks... that\u2019s it... no epic moments whatsoever... 4) Captain Phasma? The most marketed toy literally does nothing... for both movies she is in... I really really wanted this film to be amazing. I love Star Wars and it was difficult to come out of a film unhappy. Hoping for big things on the next one.","true":true}
