Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie in existence. Without spoiling anything: 1.) legacy characters are disrespected\\, 2.) the new characters are totally forgettable and horribly written\\, 3.) the movie is thematically inconsistent\\, 4.) it contradicts the greater Star Wars mythos\\, and 5.) it neuters any hype for the final chapter of the trilogy. Garbage.","true":true}
