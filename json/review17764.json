Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does not \\\"honor\\\" the legacy\\, it mocks and destroys it. Yoda shows up\\, tells Luke to train Rey\\, he agrees\\, then commits suicide? If he went there to die why not \\\"release himself to the force\\\" years ago? Rey's parents are junk traders? Snook was a supreme leader? Where are the other 6 jedi? It's like it was written by a 10 year old","true":true}
