Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. This was bad. Very bad. Have lost faith in Rotten Tomatoes. 90% from Top Critics!!!! You useless sell outs. Am I missing some irony in this? It must be tongue in cheek. Nobody could seriously put their reputation as a critic at such risk and say this is a good film. Did I read the title wrong? Was this actually a new Spaceballs film? Did Luke really milk that big breasted ocean monster?  Did Chewy actually have a novelty fake rubber chicken on a skewer and Penguin owls manning the M Falcon? Hans would be shitting in his grave. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry so I shat myself too. I think they then used that to write and make the rest of the film while I went out to buy some \u00a310 popcorn. WTF were those strange frog creatures on Lukes island? The offspring of Toad of Toad Hall and Mother Teresa. Yoda - what a disgrace. Luke - Bigger let down to the Jedi than this film was to the franchise. Rose - Glad you died. Snoke - Voldermort's now branching out. Kylo - What a lame sulky teenager. Needs a good spanking and bed without dinner. Rey - About the only thing that holds this shit together. Going to send Disney my newborns 200 shitty nappies as ideas for the next film. Perhaps they can make even more of a joke of it. I will still go see it though\\, just like everyone else. FFS","true":true}
