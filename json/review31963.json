Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead. Could've benefited from a more concise story. The Luke scenes were fantastic\\, but Rey hardly developed past what we knew about her in Force Awakens. The Last Jedi seems to have very intentionally reversed key plot points from Force Awakens. Instead of revealing who Snoke is\\, he's killed off in a ridiculous scene. We're now told Rey's parents are \\\"nobodies\\\"\\, after being teased about her parentage throughout the first film. In the first film\\, the central plan was to seek out Luke Skywalker. He dies here\\, contributing little. This film subtracts key storylines and adds virtually nothing.","true":true}
