Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waited 30 years to see again Luke\\, forgivier and savior of Vador and finally we found a poor and foul old man who could have killed his nephew on a single presomption of his possible future deeds... What ?! Are you kidding us? I could have run out of the theatre\\, angered as i was. In Fine\\, The Industrie takes avenge of Lucas' free mind\\, his children abused and degraded by the white slavers. I hoped not less after the masquerade of TFA because i've understood one thing : Abrams\\, Kasdan\\, Iger (the three \\\"white slavers\\\" as George himself called them) don't really love SW and they hate Lucas for sure. They've portrayed Unkarr Plutt the scrap merchant with a goitre like Lucas. He sends nerdy Rey to toil in the desert to collect pieces of four-leggeds\\, star destroyer\\, dreaming of Luke and flying xwings. He retains Millennium Falcon to fly. He is played by Simon Pegg compadre of Abrams\\, an actor who can't help shout his hate of Lucas. Unkarr Plutt is sort of slave owner in a way that mirrors the so-called antisemitic character of Watto in episode 1. If you look at their biographies (of the 3 \\\"white slavers\\\") you will understand what i mean.\\nI don't think Lucas as an antisemitic but i'm almost sure they think so. \\nIn my opinon\\, they intentionnaly defiled SW.\\nStar wars 7&8 are not star wars movies\\, not even movies : they are fucking invocation of Nyarlathotep\\, Destroyer of Worlds","true":true}
