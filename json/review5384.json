Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite a few weak moments and forced jokes\\, The Last Jedi contains some stunning moments that will definitely be remembered as iconic. The film really pushes mythology and character development\\, although the plot suffers as a result. Definitely better on the second watch. Luke\\, Leia\\, Kylo\\, and Rey were all fantastic\\, and the action was incredible.","true":true}
