Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Edit: One Star just in case rumors are true about not counting half stars... Help us JJ you're our only hope... This was an okay (at best) movie that would not survive the test of time with out a Star Wars skin on it. The SJW stuff doesn't penetrate me\\, as a white dude I'm content with other colors and gender prospering\\, but at least they could prosper in a well thought out and scripted movie. The only way Disney can salvage this series now is by turning this into a four part series.","true":true}
