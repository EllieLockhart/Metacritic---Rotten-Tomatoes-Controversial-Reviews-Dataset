This is NOT your story. You have the right to tell you dont like but that doesnt make the game what you say it is. Grow up.\r\rIn my opinion\\, what makes the first entry so good was the breaking of stereotypes and the deep care for its characters. This game does that as good or even better. It makes you feel desperated and anxious at first just to make the player feel disorientated\\, without knowing what to do or to think or what to expect. Then everything changes and you enter in a storm of emotions just to realize everything has a reason\\, even though we may not like it.\r\rWas this game worth it? YES\\, every minute I've played it (around 30h just in one playthrough) and every cent I've spent. If you are searching for a stroy that makes you THINK and an appeling but brutal and cruel world\\, this is your game. If you want a game with the story you already have in your mind\\, go for another one\\, this is not for you.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
