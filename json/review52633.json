Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All in all a good movie but it definitely had some unnecessary corny parts. It does seem like many scenes didn't exactly move the narrative along\\, but at the same time I don't think it necessarily made those scenes overly flat. Of course\\, many of you would suggest my opinion doesn't count because I didn't dismiss the prequels immediately either. When people get overly fond of something\\, they often forget the origins\\, and this film sits nicely with the 'ole Star Wars feel.","true":true}
