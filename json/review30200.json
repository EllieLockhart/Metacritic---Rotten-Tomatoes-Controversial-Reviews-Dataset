Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it last weekend in IMAX 3D at my favorite theater AMC Del Amo 18\\, it was great & emotional also because the last time I & the world will ever see Carrie Fisher on the Silver Screen. I understand the whole story on how my favorite character Luke Skywalker had been hiding for years after failed his nephew in his New Jedi Temple & everything from Episode 7.","true":true}
