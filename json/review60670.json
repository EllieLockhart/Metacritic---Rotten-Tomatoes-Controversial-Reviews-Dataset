The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Personally\\, I absolutely loved this game but that\u2019s just my opinion. I can completely understand why it isn\u2019t for everyone\\, however. I think a lot of people have missed the point entirely when it came to Joel dying. The whole point was to be angry about it to put you in Ellie\u2019s shoes and feel what she\u2019s going through. This couldn\u2019t have had as much of an impact if it was anyone else who died so it was a huge sacrifice for the needed response. That being said\\, I realise why that would put a lot of fans off and all I can say is if you give this game a chance\\, you\u2019ll be greatly rewarded. With that out the way\\, I think the story was very well paced and had lots of interesting twists and turns. I was definitely resistant to play as Abby initially. I was convinced there was nothing Naughty Dog could do to make me like her\\, but by the end\\, she really grew on me. This is partially down to the great story telling\\, but also because the acting and level of detail in the facial animations really conveys the emotions of the characters. I think it goes without saying that the graphics are without a doubt\\, the best this console generation has ever seen. Naughty Dog never fail when it comes to the sheer level of detail fidelity and the result is outstanding. There were so many occasions I just had to stop and look around to really take in this amazingly well crafted world and I loved it. The gameplay\\, admittedly\\, is a little clunky and outdated. There\u2019s one scene where I was trying to ride a horse and sprint with it holding L1 and also aim a gun with L2 and that just isn\u2019t a comfortable way to play for me. That being said\\, the controls didn\u2019t bother me that much because the battles felt really incredible to play. So much raw explosive power accompanied with incredible animations\\, satisfying sound effects and really tense music made such an exciting game. For me\\, this is the best game I\u2019ve ever played and I\u2019d have massively missed out if I payed attention to the amount of hate this game has got. If you\u2019re on the fence about playing it\\, just get yourself a second hand copy when it\u2019s cheap and see for yourself\\, you won\u2019t be sorry you did.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
