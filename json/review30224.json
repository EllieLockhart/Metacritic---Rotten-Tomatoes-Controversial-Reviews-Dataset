Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it twice. Can definitely see why some people would be annoyed at some of the direction of the film. On my second viewing\\, I sat next to an older couple that kept asking if it was over yet.  Didn't affect me. I loved this movie. Suggestions for those who haven't seen it yet: Don't go in with any expectations. That's how I approached this one and for the first time ever\\, a Star Wars film didn't fall short of what I wanted.","true":true}
