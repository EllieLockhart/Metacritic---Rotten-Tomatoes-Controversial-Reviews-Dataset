As usual it\u2019s the real people playing the games that give the honest opinions. If you loved the original characters you will be seriously disappointed with this sequel. So called creative director Neil Druckmann has trolled loyal fans by delivering the complete opposite of what they wanted. Joel and Ellie might as well not be in this game. If you really cared about those characters (like I did) then give this a hard pass.  The level of narcissism shown by Druckmann is unfathomable. I cannot imagine how he was allowed to derail what could have become a billion dollar franchise. This game will be bought by many loyal fans and like me they will feel betrayed by the false advertising and the blatant lies that tricked them into parting with their money. Sure the game has pretty graphics and smooth game play but beyond that it is soulless. It desperately attempts to be clever by forcing you to commit acts of atrocity and then preaches to you about how awful this is... it\u2019s moronic\\, patronising and simply fails on every level. The female writer that delivered the brilliant original had no hand in this utter garbage and it shows. I will never buy anything remotely connected to Neil Druckmann ever again. I sincerely hope that his career is over. Don\u2019t waste your time or money\\, Ghost of Tsushima is coming out soon and then CyberPunk is following later on this year. My advice is to save your money for what are much more likely to be quality entertaining titles. Or if you really need an apocalypse fix and haven\u2019t yet played Days Gone\\, it\u2019s definitely worth a look\\, it\u2019s the entertaining sequel that this game should of been.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
