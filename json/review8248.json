Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic! What can I say\\, great acting and great plot to keep the story fresh and exciting. Solid acting by old and new characters and great balance of action\\, drama\\, and fun\\, as good as any previous Star Wars film. Can\u2019t wait for episode IX.","true":true}
