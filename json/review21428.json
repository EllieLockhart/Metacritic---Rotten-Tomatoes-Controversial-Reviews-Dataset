Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't put in any spoilers or reasons why\\,  but I have went to every single star wars movie since A New Hope.    The last Jedi is the first time I left the theatre trying to talk myself into loving the movie.  I just didn't. \\n\\nI wanted to sleep on it before I made up my mind.   It is alot to process.  But while there were moments I loved.   I mean loved.    This is the first star wars film I have ever left feeling deflated","true":true}
