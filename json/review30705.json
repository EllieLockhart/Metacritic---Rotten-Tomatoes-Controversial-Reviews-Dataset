Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJW propaganda on film.  No strong male characters\\, only cucked weaklings.  Rey is an ultra-powerful Mary Sue despite little to no training. \\n Bad guys are all white males.  Hux looks just like Eric Trump.  Yeah...this is blatant progressive brainwashing.","true":true}
