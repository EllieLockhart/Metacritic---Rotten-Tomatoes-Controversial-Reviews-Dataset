Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many jokes. Bad timing of some of the jokes. First hour just seemed a Mrs and jumped all over the place. The Leia force scene was too much her surviving in outer space. Finally seeing Luke after all these years and it was just a badly written character I felt. Could have been so much more for his part. I felt there was no continuity from Force Awakens heading. \\n\\nBest part of the story was the kids re-enacting Luke's scene finally fulfilling his prophecy of the New Hope and the boy using the force to grab the broom. \\n\\n\\nI will officially never see a Rien Johnson movie again.","true":true}
