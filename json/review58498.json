Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"My only gripes are that it's slightly too long\\, can still can be slightly repetitive\\, and AI can falter at times\\, but these are minor at worst. Otherwise\\, this is an absolute masterpiece of the medium. Incredible set pieces and boss fights\\, many of which will remind you of the best of the survival horror genre while standing head and shoulders above the rest. Much improved gameplay. The story is incredible\\, and the ending makes sense once you realize the only way Ellie can begin to forgive Joel is by ending the cycle of violence he and the Fireflies started. His death had to mean something different\\, as did Ellie's life. Characters are fantastic. Abby is great\\, and her entire arc makes sense once you understand her motivation. Joel was responsible for the deaths of millions. There are no heroes in this world\\, which is another theme that many missed. I cannot wait for the HBO show!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
