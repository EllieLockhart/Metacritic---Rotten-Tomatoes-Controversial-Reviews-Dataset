Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's been a long time that I felt completely in awe about a Star Wars movie. After Rogue One I had become disgusted with the franchise. The Last Jedi sparked a new hope and gave me the feeling that I had so many years ago when I was a kid.  This movie is a must see for those both new to the Star Wars universe and the hard core fans.  Do yourself a favor and watch it in 3D IMAX\\, you will not be disappointed.","true":true}
