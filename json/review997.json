{"101487":103954,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another candy-colored\\, popcorn spectacle from Hollywood that I nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed. While it fails to capture the sense of wonder and feeling of epic\\, galactic scale that defined the original trilogy\\, The Last Jedi was still a good Star Wars film. I thought it had genuine emotional heft\\, several tightly-knitted battle scenes (I particularly enjoyed the opening sequence)\\, and good performances from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. I also found the central Luke-Rey-Kylo triangle to be compelling. I did not like Finn's plot-line or the Porgs or take much interest in Carrie Fischer's bland\\, kindly-grandma performance. Nor did I care for the lengthy run-time. I also felt that the movie climaxed too early: emotionally and with respect to plot\\, Kylo and Rey's slaughterfest in Snoke's throne room was\\, for me\\, the peak of the film and the movie fizzled thereafter. All that said\\, though\\, it was a net positive for me. It's too bad the audience's reception has been so divided. Then again\\, expectations were ridiculously high. Personally\\, I'm sure as hell glad that Rian Johnson deviated from Abrams' film-making blueprint\\, which copied A New Hope stroke for stroke. This film\\, at least\\, allowed for some directorial creativity and inspiration while still\\, mostly\\, staying true to the spirit of the original films.","true":true}
