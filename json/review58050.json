Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a few exceptions\\, this movie was satisfying\\, more so than TFA\\, in my opinion.\\n\\nSPOILERS:\\n\\nPros:  Strong women characters\\, visually stunning\\, elements of the Force that are unprecedented but could make sense\\, seeing Rey and Kylo connect\\, even if briefly\\n\\nCons:  Certain details that defy explanation (e.g.\\, Leia's near-death experience\\, Yoda's ability to use the Force from beyond the grave); Poe's rogue behaviors and his lack of appropriate remorse; the awkward humor\\n\\nSpecial mention for nostalgia's sake goes to the puppet Yoda (not CGI\\, yay!) \/ Luke interaction and the Luke \/ Leia scene... a bit of an emotional one for me since I know it's the last time the two of them will ever share the screen.\\n\\nFor the haters who say this movie is man-hating\\, politically correct drivel:  Get over it.  Yes\\, most of the men in this movie were a little Homer-Simpsonish\\, but you know what?  Women have put up with second-citizen representation in film for decades.  Sorry your feewings are hurt.  Also:  Yeah\\, Luke is bitter and cynical.  A lot can happen in forty years.  No one scoffed at Obi Wan for becoming a hermit later in life.\\n\\nAlthough I am a big SW franchise fan\\, I'm not going to let myself get worked up over a few flaws in a movie.  I'm ready for the franchise to end (hopefully satisfyingly)\\, though.","true":true}
