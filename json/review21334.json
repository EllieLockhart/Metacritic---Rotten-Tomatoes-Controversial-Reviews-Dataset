Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i went to watch the last jedi excited.  walked out disappointed.  make no mistake\\, the movie was made great.  but the story\\, i didn't like it.  it didn't feel like it was a star wars story.  i didn't like that snoke's story wasn't expounded.  and worst\\, i didn't like what they did to luke.  so i guess\\, i prefer force awakens than this one.  at least that movie felt like a star wars movie.","true":true}
