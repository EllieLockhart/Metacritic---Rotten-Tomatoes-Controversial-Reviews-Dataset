Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was too long. I like Finn\\, but all of his scenes seemed to be useless. Also\\, I cant say anything about luke that hasnt already been said\\, but who leaves an elaberate map to a place that he went to die\\, and on top of that why didnt he just kill himself. lastly\\, everything build up in the force awakens is completely disregarded in this movie.","true":true}
