Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some really bad scenes hurt this film (which ironically contains some of the best scenes in any Star Wars movie). I was uncomfortable with some of the liberties taken with the use of the Force by some characters - Han's line from TFA echoed in my head throughout the movie: \\\"That's not how the Force works!\\\"","true":true}
