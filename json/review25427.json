Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No one in my theater applauded. I know I didn't want to after that. She's too old to begin the training but somehow doesn't need books because she's born knowing everything about the Force even though she can't define it. (Spoilers) Crystal foxes mean nothing. Somehow they have magic bombers from nowhere during an evacuation. For some reason Star Destroyers aren't able to move or shoot even though they were faster than Rebel ships in episode IV. There's dice for some reason. Naz is shooting at Union workers? Why do they save the dogs and not the kids\\, just giving them rings? Kylo can't sense that Luke isn't there? How does Snoke link Kylo and Rey? Even Vader couldn't talk to Luke unless he was nearby. The Force isn't the internet. So Kylo is Supreme Leader now? How come three fighters shoot Leia into space but they don't send any more fighters after? Do we have a Rose\/Finn\/Rey thing happening now? I guess the real evil people are the rich and famous\\, which would be Hollywood in real life. A guy in jail betrayed you? Not a plot twist; it's twisted plot. There's so much that just doesn't make any sense. Obviously no one involved with this movie knows how the Force works! ","true":true}
