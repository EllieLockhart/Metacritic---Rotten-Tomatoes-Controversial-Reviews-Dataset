Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent. For Star Wars fans who love film rather than those obsessed with the mythology. The film has a different rhythm and more humour than other Star Wars films but it is still very much a Star Wars movie. The plot may not be what the fanboys wanted\\, but this is a film happy to challenge what we thought we knew and where we thought the story was going. A great movie in its own right but also injecting something new into a franchise so close to my heart. Thank heavens for freshening up the Star Wars galaxy and setting it up for another few decades and a new generation. My 8 year old son loved it too.","true":true}
