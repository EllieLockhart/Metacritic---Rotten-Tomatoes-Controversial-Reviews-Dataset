{"101487":121842,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"for some reason I cannot get this out of caps....mind you i feel a bit shouty anyway.....I FINALLY MANAGED TO CATCH THE MOVIE THIS EVENING. wOW WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.tHE SCRIPT WAS POOR\\, SOME OF THE ACTING WAS AWFUL\\, THE COMEDY WAS BADLY MIS-TIMED AND VERY POORLY IMPLEMENTED AND THE CHARACTER ARCS WERE IN THE MAIN NON EXISTENT. i WILL ELABORATE IF YOU BEAR WITH ME. wHERE TO START\\, ....hUX\\, NOW DOMHNALL gLEESON IS AN ABSOLUTELY SUPERB ACTOR\\, GOOD GUY OR VILLAIN \\, he can handle it all with ease but the dialogue in this film is so poor\\, particularly in its use of humour that the scene with Poe in the x wing facing down the ship with hux is awful to the point of embarassing. Mr gleeson looked uncomfortable delivering the cheesy dialogue. a joke about holding the line in star wars....really. these moments of awful humour continued throughout the film and were totally misplaced. Princess leia flying through space\\,...awful. Bombs falling from a ship in space \\, awful\\, the fear of ships running out of fuel while moving in space...awful. so many things were just badly presented and poorly written\\, however one of the biggest problems is the lack of character arc for new characters and the shameful way older characters were treated. admiral holdo\\, could have been great but was a one dimensional character that was basically a bit rubbish at her job.phasma\\, should be a legendary character in star wars but was wasted by a writer who has no clue what to do with her. Finn \\, had no growth in this movie at all\\, rey is somehow amazing at everything\\, which is fine but doesnt make me like her as she has not had to work or suffer for anything. rose.....a complete and utter non character that to be fair was a complete waste of time in the film\\, she did one thing in the entire movie and that was the wrong thing. the sub plot of rose and finn added so much time to the movie but absolutely nothing else\\, it was completely pointless\\, the film could have been cut by 40 minutes and no one would have noticed. Rey and kylo are not interesting at this stage\\, rey is a magical force wizard and kylo is neither one thing or the other. the thing that i found the most odd was the treatment of the luke skywalker character. the character that had so much faith in others that he was willing to sacrifice himself for a belief that his father \\, the evil lord vader\\, had some goodness and was in fact proved right in this. yet in this movie he is willing to consider murdering his sister and best friends child because he thinks he may be bad.....really and the way the character ends is the epitome of lazy writing. now many people may think i am a star wars fanboy\\, i am not ....in fact i walked out of the cinema while watching the original star wars in the 70s\\, when i was about 12 .i only started to appreciate the franchise in my later years. i do not collect the movies\\, or toys but do enjoy a good movie. i enjoyed < the force awakens\\, despite it being drivative\\, i enjoyed rogue one\\, i really did not enjoy the last jedi and the fault is not with the actors\\, or the special effects crew\\, or those who invested their cash to make the movie. no the faults in this movie lie squarely with the writers and the director. this was not just a bad star wars movie but is actually bad movie fullstop.","true":true}
