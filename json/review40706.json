Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest installment of the SW saga was more of the same to us\\, mostly introducing new ethnic and gender diverse generation of the rebellion fighting against the old white guys of the first order. Nothing new from a story standpoint\\, perfect for those who need their fix of more stuff exploding.","true":true}
