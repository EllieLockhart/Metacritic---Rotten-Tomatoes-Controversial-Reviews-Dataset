Here it goes. I went into this game very excited I mean I even managed to avoided all spoilers like crazy and went into the game blind AF.  That being said after playing and beating the game I can see how much of a negative impact it would have been to have had the plot ruined by leaks. The story left me feeling all sorts of ways. INever actually written a review before but anyways... Here it goes. I went into this game very excited I mean I even managed to avoided all spoilers like crazy and went into the game blind AF.  That being said after playing and beating the game I can see how much of a negative impact it would have been to have had the plot ruined by leaks. The story left me feeling all sorts of ways. I mean... It's an emotional rollercoaster! One second you're up then next you're like \\\"OMG why?!?!\\\" then you're back to fearing for your life. It just leaves you feeling... like a hodgepodge of feelings and that's a good thing in my eyes. The game is also very pretty. Like play this game at night with the volume up on 4k. It's breathtaking. It's also surprisingly long. Like near the end the game has so many cuts to black that I was like \\\"is this the end? No wait maybe this is the end\\\" I'm jumping around here but yeah I enjoyed it. The only reason I couldn't give it a perfect score is because.. Well...Where's the multiplayer? The first game had such a bad ass online mode that I loved and would have loved to experienced here. But... It's nowhere to be found. But hey new game + is a thing soo... Yeah. That's my review\u2026 Expand","true":true}
