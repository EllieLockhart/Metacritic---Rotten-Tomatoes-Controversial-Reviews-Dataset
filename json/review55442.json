Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. Del Toro is miscast\\, and Dern is REALLY miscast. The last movie was a lot better\\, episode 7. This reminded me of the JarJar Binks Star Wars movie\\, trying to be cutesy poo. Had a couple moments but mostly crash and burn. ","true":true}
