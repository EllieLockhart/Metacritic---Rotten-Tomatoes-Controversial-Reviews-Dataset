Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A deliberate somber tone makes it harder to love than TFA\\, but a very worthy addition to the story and a very good movie.  New cast was great\\, and I am completely sold on the Rey\/Finn\/Poe story and can't wait to see where it goes from here.  I enjoyed the pacing\\, and story.","true":true}
