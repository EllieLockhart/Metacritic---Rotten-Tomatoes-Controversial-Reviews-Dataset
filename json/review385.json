I'm still experimenting with it's \\\"butterfly effect\\\" system and what I like about it is how you can go to it at any time to see what effect your actions and decisions have so far in the story. Game looks good and it feels right and definitely has some replay value.\rThis genre lacks enough quality games and with UD you have something unique and surprisingly fun.
