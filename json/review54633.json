Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly disappointing Star Wars entry and I can\u2019t believe it is rating in the 90% range from critics. SPOILERS I really wanted to love this film and I am a huge Star Wars fan but there are things about it that can\u2019t be overlooked. All of the Rebel Resistance scenes seem like a waste of time. The writing is really poor on this film. The \u2018big reveal\u2019 of Rey\u2019s parents is completely anti-climatic and meaningless. Leia\u2019s survival in space due to the force just seemed stupid. And Luke...we don\u2019t get the Jedi mature Luke\\, but the whiny Star Wars Luke for most of the movie. Rey also seemed to get lost in this movie...and Chewie is barely in the movie for just a couple of jokey things. Even Yoda\u2019s cameo was a wasted opportunity. It just seemed poorly written\\, and almost forced - like\\, it was going to be a Star Wars movie whether you liked it or not. The \u2018adventure\u2019 aspect was actually kind of boring and the stupid casino scene was really dumb. There were a lot of dumb things and poor plot choices\\, like killing off Snoke as if he is just a meaningless stormtrooper. I did like Kylo for the most part but as a whole I thought this movie was a real let down\\, which is really too bad.","true":true}
