Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it has some great action scenes and visuals\\, TLJ stumbles where TFA  was strongest- its characters.  Nearly every character aside from Rey and Kylo Ren got the short end of the stick in this movie.","true":true}
