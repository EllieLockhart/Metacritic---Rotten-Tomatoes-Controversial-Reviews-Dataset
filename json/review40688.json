Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This just might be the greatest Star Wars film in the entire saga. Rian Johnson takes so many bold choices that I thoroughly enjoy all of them. The last 40 minutes is arguably the best Star Wars to ever Star Wars.","true":true}
