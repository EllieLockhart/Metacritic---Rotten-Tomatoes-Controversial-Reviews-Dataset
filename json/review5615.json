Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't enjoy this movie at all. While there were some cool moments\\, many of them felt entirely unearned and almost seemed to operate outside of the pre-established tone and universe. Gone is the even-handed plodding towards good and balance in the universe. Instead it seemed like a lot of petulant children in scenes\\, and the one character who seemed to operate with weight and lend gravitas to scenes was almost immediately take. Out of commission. \\n\\nNot going to be much of a rewatch.","true":true}
