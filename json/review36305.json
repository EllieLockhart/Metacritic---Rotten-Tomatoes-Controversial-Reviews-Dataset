Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Luke Skywalker character was totally ruined by Ryan Johnson and Disney!! I have been a fan of Star Wars and the expanded universe all my life\\, but this one movie Is garbage. The worst of all the Saga. I love the idea of a female Jedi\\, but aside from that\\, the writers did not even try to come up with a decent story.","true":true}
