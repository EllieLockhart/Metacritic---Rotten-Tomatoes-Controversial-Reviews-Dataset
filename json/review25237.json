Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No answers to any of the key questions asked in The Force Awakens. No backstory to Snoke\\, Kylo or Ren. Skywalker killed off along with his character being severely dented. Really badly written comedy moments that just don't sit right in the film\\, at some points it felt like I was watching Spaceballs by Mel Brooks. Mary Poppins makes an appearance. Chewbacca turns Vegan\\, the list goes on. Not sure how they're going to rectify any of this in Episode 9. Good luck!","true":true}
