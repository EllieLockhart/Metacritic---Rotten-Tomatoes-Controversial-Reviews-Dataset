Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It looked like a great Star Wars film but the story is a terrible mess. None of the major questions about Rey and Snoke are really answered. Major Characters (Luke\\, Snoke) are wasted plus now Leia will have to be killed-off off screen. I can't see how they are going to fix this debacle.","true":true}
