Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible movie.  I am a fan of 40 years and this\\, hands down\\, was the worse thing I have ever seen.  I am sooooo glad I got my money back after this garbage.  Garbage.  And Rian Johnson\\, how are you so f**ked in the head you think this is good?   How can Disney defend this?  I have to stop here...im getting pissed.  RIan Johnson\\, you sir are a hack...and I hope....I PRAY\\, you lose the new trilogy you were handed and this can be striked from canon...\\nGarbage.....","true":true}
