Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is..... It's just a migraine. You truly feel the runtime trudge you along to such a terrible extent that you hate yourself for watching it. It's a truly terribly written mess that oddly prioritizes cool visuals and ideas over the integrity of the storytelling. There are too many dropped plot points from The Force Awakens\\, making it feel as if it isn't a sequel at all\\, and the characters are just terrible. There's no investment to be had in any of their storylines\\, and even one of the most iconic characters in history\\, Luke Skywalker\\, is just completely butchered through unfathomable inconsistencies for the purpose of advancing the theme of the movie and its tragically written narrative. In conclusion: as a long time star wars fan\\, this movie hurts. As a viewer who watches movies critically and takes  importance with storytelling: it's a headache. For the average thoughtless popcorn viewer: Entertaining\\, visually stunning\\, and high level production. \\nBut\\, sadly\\, that's just where it ends. \\nThis movie\\, or rather now\\, this franchise\\, is a beautiful disaster. \\nTime to set the reset button. \\\"Better luck next time?\\\"","true":true}
