Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never walked out of a Star Wars movie with so much to unpack and chew on.  Surprising in the best ways possible.  There's very little I didn't like about this film - apart from a few jokes and drawn out scenes\\, this is as close to perfect as you can get without actually being perfect","true":true}
