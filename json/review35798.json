Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is not a bad movie. But what critics don't seem to understand is that a good movie is not by any means a good Star Wars movie. I am a long time fan of the franchise and after seeing TLJ I just felt underwhelmed and shocked. The director wanted to surprise the audience by his new and bold direction but at what cost? Is surprising the audience really worth disappointing the fans that have kept this franchise alive for the past 40 years?","true":true}
