Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how to rate this movie lower. I was so dissapointed. Rarely do I watch a movie\\, and think how boring it is. Had it not been for my son being with me\\, I would have walked out. The stupid references\\, creatres and comedic moments\\, plus so many totally inexplcable or excusable scenes. Nothing was epic. Things were done simply \\\"because reasons\\\" Rian Johnson obviously hate Star Wars and should be kept away from cinema in general after this. Go back to Karaoke\\, your better at that.","true":true}
