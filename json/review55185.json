Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I never saw this abomination. Watch it at your own risk. Everything you hold dear from the old trilogy is pissed on. It takes a great deal of effort to ruin an awesome franchise like star wars...... But Rian Johnson did. I hope you realize you created the worst imaginable rendition of a star wars film imaginable. Thanks for ruining childhood memories and Luke Skywalkers characteter. Who? Who wanted to see him milk a space alien instead of using his force and Saber skills? Please find me that person.... Oh wait that's Ryan Johnson. You should be ashamed of yourself. ","true":true}
