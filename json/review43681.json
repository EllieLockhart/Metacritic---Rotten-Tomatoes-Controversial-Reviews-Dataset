Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was so good\\, the reviews had been bad so I had low expectations but I didn't stop smiling the whole movie. Finally a plot where I didn't see what was coming every moment. They stayed away from the stupid nostalgia that has been ruining everything lately\\, and were able to incorporate those lighthearted moments and jokes naturally instead of in a \\\"oh aren't we so Star Wars witty\\\" way. I loved it\\, my favorite so far\\, I can't wait to see the new trilogy from this director in the future. ??????","true":true}
