Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED this movie. I grew up with the originals and was obsessed with Luke Skywalker's hero's journey\\, and yet I found the turn of events for his character totally believable. I thought that the movie understood and respected the originals and created something new. 30 years later the arcs and growth of the characters and for the star wars universe makes sense. It is time for a feminist understanding of leadership and organized resistance. I found the film engaging\\, thrilling\\, and surprising\\, and true to the heart of Star Wars. It is the rightful next step in the series.","true":true}
