Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi defies all expectations in the worst possible way. Whilst there are some interesting scenes\\, and some great lightsaber duels\\, the majority of the movie is made up of uninspired garbage that fails to be creative or entertaining\\, whilst simultaneously grinding the story to a halt. Old characters are done a disservice in order to pass the baton onto the new\\, whether they are ready or not. Unanswered questions from TFA are either completely ignored\\, or resolved in an extremely underwhelming way. And characters introduced in this film fail to be interesting\\, causing some problems toward the end when the film asks you to care\\, but you can't. However\\, I didn't have a problem with the humour in this movie\\, as mentioned by some others. It seems to work more often than not\\, aside from a couple of moment which I thought to be character-breaking in the moment. Overall\\, this movie will disappoint compared to the one you've pictured in your mind\\, which makes me think that to enjoy this film you must enter with a completely clean slate.","true":true}
