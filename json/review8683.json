Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flat and unimaginative. Undoes the interest of episode vii tfa. Slapstick comedy\\, talking head shots\\, big nonsensical plot points. The actors tried hard but there's so much working against this one. The worst Star Wars of all time. I mean\\, you might like it if you're into The Fast and The Furious for the dialogue.","true":true}
