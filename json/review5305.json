Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely not what I was expecting. Good story but with an unsatisfactory ending. I\u2019m a fan of the \u201ccomic book\u201d movies that are part of the movie landscape. I expect more character development than I see in this movie. ","true":true}
