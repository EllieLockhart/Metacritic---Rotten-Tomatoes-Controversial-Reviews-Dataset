Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics appear to have been paid. I\u00b4m a Star Wars fanatic. And this movie BLEW worse than the prequels. It does leave space for the last movie to be good\\, but I have no desire to see a Star Wars trilogy made by this one\u00b4s writer\/director.","true":true}
