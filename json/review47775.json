Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When trying to be the darkest starwars film while simultaneously trying to be the funniest\\, a lot of the humor takes away from serious and emotionality engaging scenes. Pair that with the up and down pacing and an entire plot line that goes absolutely nowhere. What you are left with is a Star Wars movie that is confused with what it wants to be and fans leaving the theater conflicted on how they should feel.","true":true}
