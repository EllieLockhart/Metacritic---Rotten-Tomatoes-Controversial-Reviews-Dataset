Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time i watched this movie i enjoyed it\\, apart from the first half of the film. But the more i thought about it the less i liked it. The way they portrayed Luke was completely different to how most fans viewed him\\, and the way they killed of Snoke was preposterous\\, surely a being with his power would of had a premenision off danger. Also all the best parts of the movie were undermined by poorer parts of the movie\\, For example The fight scene of Kylo and Rey against the guards was very good but it is impossible for Rey to be That good with a lightsaber Because Luke \\,for some reason didn't want to train her. This links back to my earlier point of how luke wasn't depicted as most fans viewed him. Luke and Kilos duel was good\\, It had me and the edge of my seat and i loved it how luke was force projecting himself across the galaxy\\, But again this scene was undermined in the next scene when we see luke sat on his island and everyone  is thinking he's going to train Rey in the next film and have the awesome fight with Snoke everyone been waiting for. OH WAIT luke dies for no reason and smoke dies in a pathetic way aswell. Having said all this i have to congratulate Rian Johnson for somehow killing the star wars movies and also creating a worse character then jar jar binks\\, I am of course referring to Rose","true":true}
