Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a little rushed\\, as was episode seven but I suppose that's the Disney factor. The story is good\\, well written with good amount of humor but not too much. Luke Skywalkers development was the biggest draw back. I think it took risks and that earned it a place among the best installments. For carries fishers final performance it highlighted her very well. Visually it is the best looking in the series with vibrant colors and exotic locations. In my opinion not having enough time to train wit Luke\\, Rey should not be just discovering the force like she is. It seems to me she is just winging it and that is a crucial part of character development that has been missing from this trilogy so far. It was good\\, could have been better but did top its predecessor.","true":true}
