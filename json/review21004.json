Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was not entirely pleased with this movie. My biggest complaint was that Luke seemed completely out of character based on what we know of him from the original trilogy.\\n\\nIts unfortunate as I had high hopes for this movie but I was thoroughly disappointed.\\n\\nHaving said that I still think its better than episodes I and II.","true":true}
