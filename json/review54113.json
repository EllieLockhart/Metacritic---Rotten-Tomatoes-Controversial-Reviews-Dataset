Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't really understand the hate that this movie was given\\, as the general plot was interesting and it felt exciting throughout the movie. Personally\\, I felt that there wasn't a dull or boring moment in the film. Even when the action isn't going on\\, we felt tension in ideas and conflicting sides inside the resistance which was a nice touch to add as a sub-plot. Though the casino sub-plot didn't feel as powerful as I thought it was\\, it was still interesting enough for me\\, in the beginning of the Casino scene we feel like something big is going to happen\\, or at least something will change. However\\, at the end\\, there was no character development\\, no achievement\\, just a random sub-plot to fill in time. I understand that the movie wants to slowly shift away from the original trilogy and start introducing new characters as it did in the past few Star Wars films\\, they have been slowly taking away screen time of the original actors. However\\, I feel it won't do as successful if the new characters lacked an emotional connection or relationship with the audience\\, this could be simply achieved by having us follow along with them on a character arc and grow with these characters. This would make the audience feel much closer and connected to the ideas\\, characters and conflict of the movies.","true":true}
