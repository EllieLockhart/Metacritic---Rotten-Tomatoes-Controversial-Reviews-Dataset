Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This and FA are on par with Clone Wars. Disney\\, please stop ruining these films. Studios continue to betray audiences with this swill\\, which will hurt the future of cinema\/theater-going. Someone at Disney\\, please\\, for the love of storytelling\\, go back and reread Jospeh Campbell\u2019s Heroes Journey and get back on track. It worked for Lucas\u2019 original trio. That or hire Christopher Nolan to get on to something better. Half a star for poor acting\\, lazy storytelling\\, bad\/awkward timing for comedy\\, and an overall handling of character and plot that\u2019s just embarrassing. Total disloyalty toward fans to lure meat into seats and sell toys. We need the Force back the way it was. Help us (any other studio)\\, you\u2019re our only hope.","true":true}
