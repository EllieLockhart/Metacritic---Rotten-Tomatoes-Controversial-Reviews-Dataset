Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie since phantom menace\\, full of so much Disney bologna. How many cutesy animals can they shove down our throats? Also what's with all the wtf moments they felt they needed to add. If this was all that was going to happen in this trilogy is to fall back to all the stupid stuff we hated about the prequels then they should've gotten everyone killed and ruined right in the first movie. Force Awakens and Rogue One are Star Wars movies\\, the last jedi is not.","true":true}
