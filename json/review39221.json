Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had it's flaws for sure but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a blast watching it! Finn's arc felt a bit shoehorned and random and some of the reveals felt a bit lackluster\\, but some\\, I feel\\, are acting as set up for episode 9\\, and if I'm wrong\\, I still thoroughly enjoyed the direction they took the franchise and I had a blast!","true":true}
