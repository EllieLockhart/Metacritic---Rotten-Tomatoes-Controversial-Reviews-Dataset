Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I needed a break with the usual Star Wars stories which can become repetitive. I enjoyed this film and thought Rian came with fresh ideas and huge potential. There has never been a more action packed Star Wars save for RoTS. TFA was an incredible film\\, however it was a rehash of the original which was its biggest flaw.  Rian came to do something completely different and to open up Star Wars by combining old Star Wars characters and known places with new places and ledgends based material which is great to see being used. This film is being panned because it doesn't adhere to typical Star Wars\\, yet it would be being  personally I'd give this a clear 4slated if it was a r same people. This film deserves far more credit than it has been given by the fans\\, I enjoyed it and hold it as one of my favourite in the series. I didn't think it was a good idea to bring back JJ for IX before I went to see TLJ but now I feel he is the right person to bro g in and complete his story. As he was the principle creator of the characters. I think when episode IX comes out people will appreciate this film more as it may make more sense to the people who just don't seem to get what Rian was going for\\, or the people who genuinely just didn't like it. But it doesn't deserve 49%. I'd say it deserves a clean 85% .","true":true}
