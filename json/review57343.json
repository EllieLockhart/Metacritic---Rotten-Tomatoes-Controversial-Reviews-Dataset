Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the best Star Wars movie of all time. The story was great\\, the plot twists were awesome! Kyle Ren's character was developed greatly and his conflict with Rey is one of the best in the series because of the layers of depth and emotion and unpredictability. I love that some of Kyle ren's actions could have multiple motivations and we do not truly know which motive lead him. Also it was a face passed movie full of great action scenes and was visually stunning. Most of the negative comments on this movie are just nit picking. Although some sub plots were not entirely interesting most other negative reviews are dumb complaints like \\\"the force doesn't work like that\\\" or \\\"how did this person get so powerful\\\" my question is who cares? The movie was great\\,don't nitpick the little things","true":true}
