Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson tried too hard to make the \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" into a proper disney movie\\, focusing heavily on humor which appears to be directet at a younger audience then befor.\\nThe general theme of \\\"let the past die\\\" was taken quite literal and resulted sadly more then once in a character end which seemed either rushed or just plain lazy.\\nI still enjoy it as an addition to the Starwars sage\\, but sadly it was not the sequel I was looking for.","true":true}
