Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was disappointed in the story and bad character development. Almost everything that was set up from TFA was thrown out the window\\, it's like this movie was made to be a stand alone film. The cinematography was great as we're most of the special effects\\, but other than that.....meh. This is the first Star Wars film that I will not be buying.","true":true}
