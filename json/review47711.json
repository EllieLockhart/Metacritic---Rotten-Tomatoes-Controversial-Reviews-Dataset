Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the theatre I was extremely disappointed.\\nKylo Ren is the only good part of this movie.\\nLuke's storyline was horrible out of character.\\nLeia flying like superman made me cringe.\\nStory was really badly written and uninteresting\\, was actually bored in the cinema as a star wars fan.","true":true}
