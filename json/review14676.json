Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been more excited about the state of this franchise than I am right now. And as much shit as people give Disney... I think you have to applaud them. Rewriting Rogue One's ending to one in which everyone dies was bold and decidedly un-disney. Allowing Rian to think outside the box of \\\"wish fulfillment\\\" is incredibly un-Disneylike. I mean\\, one of their freakin' major tag lines for the last zillion years is \\\"When you wish upon a star\\\". Hats off to you Disney for not just throwing up some bubble gum crap... Star Wars is in good hands. The universe is wide the f*** open.","true":true}
