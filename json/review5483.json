Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed Luke Skywalker's character and meaningfulness of the OT.  Crafting a future for the franchise did not require annihilating and obviating the heart and soul of the past.  Johnson stabbed a knife into the hearts of many of the original generation of viewers - and then twisted it deep and hard to gut us. He utterly destroyed that which drew many us into the Star Wars Universe in the first place and made us want to keep playing in this universe.  Congratulations Disney and Johnson\\, your success in \\\"killing the past\\\"  has killed the future of Star Wars for many of us.","true":true}
