Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**UPDATE: After finding out that 1\/2 start is not counted...I'm changing to 1 star** \\n\\nIf this movie was property weighted\\, it would be less than 25%.\\n\\nRian Johnson has insulted the most loyal and loving Star Wars fans. Luke Skywalker would never do half that. Chases don't make sense. So many plot holes. Ruined snoke. Ruined Rey's parents. The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson will go down in history for ruining the the Star Wars saga that could have been a modern day myth that instead had our beloved hero drinking out of water walrus utters and going against everything a Jedi stands for.","true":true}
