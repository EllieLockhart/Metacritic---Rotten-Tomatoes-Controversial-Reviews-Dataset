Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why make Snoke to kill him with no explanation?\\nWhy not use Akbar in the suicide run? Where were the other knights of Ren? We're they the guards? Bummer about a Rey's heritage. Absolutely no reveals in this movie\\, where is the world building? Loved the fight scene in the throne room.","true":true}
