Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If seeing Leia rise from the dead\\, take on a superman pose\\, and fly through space weren't enough to convince you that Rian Johnson had no idea what he was doing\\, then the parts where Luke Skywalker is reduced to backup-gag-machine and the Rebels blow up the latest Imperial uber-ship by turning a transport ship into a lightspeed-ram (inadvertently making every ship battle in the future SW universe quickly devolve to who can launch lightspeed missiles first) certainly will.\\n\\nAfter the success of The Force Awakens\\, this feels like a jarring return to the dark ages of the prequels.","true":true}
