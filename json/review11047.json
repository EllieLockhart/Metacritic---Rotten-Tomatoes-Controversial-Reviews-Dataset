Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here are only few things out of many  i didnt like about the movie:\\n\\n-Finn and Rose's Side story \\n-Snoke was wasted potential.\\n-Luke's charatcer development\\n- pacing issues\\, certain parts felt boring\\n-disjointed scenes. like 3-4 sub plots\\, with only one plot i found interesting","true":true}
