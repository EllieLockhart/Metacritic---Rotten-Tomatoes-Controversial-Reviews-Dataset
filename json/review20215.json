Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok to good in some respects but they didn't do Luke any justice at all and did whatever they wanted with the force. Nothing was consistent with the either prior trilogies\\, and again no fight that comes close the the prequel's Lightsaber fights. Very disappointing. ","true":true}
