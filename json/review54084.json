Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do enjoy a great standalone action flick from time to time in which a new foundation is established and from which new concepts are spring boarded. However\\, Star Wars is not a new concept\\, its root system or foundation is well established. To remove the foundation from something by changing many of its fundamental characteristics and load bearing walls\\, one will quickly find a new construction. In cases in which load bearing walls\\, key characteristics of the franchise such as but not limited to Luke Skywalker\\, must be treated with respect as they are removed to ensure that the structure does not implode. In that same vein\\, they must be replaced with a load bearing wall that is equally robust if not more robust in the process if one does not intend for the structure to fail at the point of alteration. It is my fear that the load bearing walls that are being removed (Luke\\, Han Solo\\, etc.) are not being replaced with much more than sticks and drywall and as a result the structure\\, in time\\, inevitably fail. Although\\, I can appreciate the dynamic between Kylo and Rey\\, I feel their innate abilities to have such command over the nature of the force despite a lack of training (struggle) seems to gut some of the prestige for me. \\nSuch a counter intuitive deviation from the trajectory within the physical tapestry of the Star Wars Universe seems to rattle the foundation of what constitutes the realm known as \\\"Star Wars.\\\" To slap the name of Star Wars onto that which is only a mere reflection of what was previously known as Star Wars supplants the series' uniqueness with ambiguity and shallow attempts at balancing character introductions without first fleshing them out. Many missed opportunities to set this adventure upon new heights followed from the method in which the movie was approached. Instead of remodeling a building and adding another story to its current foundation\\, the foundation was demolished\\, and entirely new building was constructed in which only the outside appearance retains some semblance to the buildings previous greatness. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with trying something innovative with this series\\, however in doing such\\, it is necessary to first establish plot shifts that evolve out of a catalyst that is birthed within a plot that is consistent with and logically follows from the foundation. That is to say\\, innovation does not have to come with disregard to the past\\, it only need to logically follow\\, or be backed with a sufficient reason\\, as to why the story line is shifting the way it is. Ultimately\\, without a robust reason for changes in a system while simply interjecting them\\, removes the core feel that is Star Wars with something that is seemingly artificial with a hollow shell claiming to be Star Wars whilst being something altogether different.","true":true}
