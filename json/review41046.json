Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie forgot where it came from and is leaving this fan worried about where it intends to go.  Rian Johnson gave the big ol middle finger to everything JJ Abrams set up in episode 7.  The pieces for a beautiful story were all there\\, Rian just shit on them.  \\n\\nEverything that TFA got you wondering about is just oblierated in this movie.  I no longer care because this movie did not progress any characters or storylines.  Instead we followed the pointless Rose around to hear her preach on inequality.  Dumb.\\n\\nAnd\\, My Goodness was it written solely to propel a leftist agenda???  It sure seemed so.","true":true}
