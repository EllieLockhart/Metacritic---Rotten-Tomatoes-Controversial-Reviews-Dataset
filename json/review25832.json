{"101487":157308,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Note: The following is my personal opinion and I fully realize many people can watch the same movie and have very different opinions. I have only seen the movie once\\, so I may have missed things and my thoughts could evolve after multiple viewings. If my opinion changes over time after watching again I will update accordingly. I almost never write movie reviews\\, to the extent I cannot remember the last time I wrote one.\\n\\nBeing a fan of Star Wars is so ingrained into my personality you might think it was imprinted into my DNA. The return of Star Wars to the theaters with The Force Awakens (TFA) was truly an experience I never thought I would get again\\, and while the movie was not perfect it was better than anything I was personally looking for. I ended up watching the film six times in theaters. My complaints for the film were few and I genuinely felt that whatever the next installment had it could fill in those gripes I had\\, mainly character development and obviously the real return of Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nWith a shocking title\\, The Last Jedi (TLJ)\\, I could not wait to see the new movie in theaters. The movie trailers were fantastic with incredible music (as always). My minor gripe was the Porgs\\, but a silly alien animal was not going to get in the way of my enjoyment (I love RotJ\\, regardless of how unbelievable an Ewok victory over the Empire was). When Disney went so far as to give Rian Johnson a trilogy before this movie was even released\\, it eliminated any doubt in my mind that I would not fully enjoy The Last Jedi and be completely satisfied with the experience.\\n\\nGoing into any movie there are things you hope to see\\, but I never go into a movie expecting to get the story exactly the way I want with the ending I desire. There would be nothing enjoyable if that was the case and the mystery and wonder of Star Wars are some of the many reasons I enjoy this franchise. I expected to love this film\\, and as a lifelong Star Wars fan I was prepared to look past any minor faults so long as the overall experience was there. \\n\\nUnfortunately\\, The Last Jedi is nothing short of an absolute mess with miss after miss along the way. Johnson's script drastically alters the story arc in ways that are impossible to recover from. Existing characters are fundamentally altered\\, some are left stagnant with nearly no progression of their development\\, and others completely and irrevocably discarded; all while new characters are added... some of which are near pointless and unnecessary. I can see what Johnson was trying to do\\, and I truly appreciate the risks he tried to take\\, but I personally felt each was executed poorly leading to a film with a meandering plot where everything is left feeling half baked.\\n\\nThere was way too much effort to induce humor. Star Wars has always had a few well-placed lines in the movies for maximum effect without distracting from the film. In The Last Jedi\\, you are constantly smacked with humor that feels forced\\, poorly timed\\, or just plain unnecessary. The attempt at adding humor every chance there is overshadows the few great times the humor hits perfectly.\\n\\nThe movie drags on slowly\\, as one of the main plot points is literally an event slowly dragging along over the course of the film. The solution to that plot point feels recycled (granted with a much more explosive result) that could have happened much sooner with little to no apparent reason for keeping it hidden. This plot point was dragged out in excruciating slow motion solely to give time for other characters to go off and do things\\, all while missing next to nothing from the main group.\\n\\nThe main ending to the film is somewhat satisfying\\, only in the context of the rest of the film being a missed opportunity or letdown. The actual ending of the film is the equivalent of a post credits scene from a superhero film\\, providing a nugget of information that is definitely intriguing- but it is hard to see how this fits into the trilogy. I saw this as a hint to the future in the Star Wars universe\\, but a hint that seems to be too far in the future to truly impact the final film.\\n\\nOverall\\, leaving the film and processing it the last few days\\, I haven't been able to shake this feeling of total disappointment. This is not a disappointment from not getting the plot I wanted to see\\, but a disappointment of feeling like this movie just simply has a poor story\\, is poorly implemented\\, and poorly fits into not only the current trilogy but the entire story arc of all the films. I am devastated\\, and actually quite angry with myself for not liking the film. I hope my opinion changes as I see it more\\, or I at least find a way to accept the movie for what it is. I wish I felt the same as the many five-star perfect score reviews I am seeing.\\n\\nThe task for JJ Abrams to close out the trilogy seems nearly impossible considering what's left. Additionally\\, the difference in storytelling styles between Abrams and Johnson is jarring. You might have a feeling of whiplash after how far the gears changed between TFA and TLJ\\, and it will almost certainly be experienced again with Episode 9 transitioning between the two again. I am left with a feeling of hesitation towards seeing whatever Episode 9 will be\\, and literally no excitement (maybe even contempt if it means no Kenobi film) for whatever trilogy comes next from Johnson.\\n-----\\nTL DR: Unfortunately\\, The Last Jedi is nothing short of an absolute mess with miss after miss along the way.
