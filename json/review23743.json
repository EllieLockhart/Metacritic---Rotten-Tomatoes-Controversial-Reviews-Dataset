Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker deserved better than what this nonsensical mess did to him.  Snoke deserved better than what this nonsensical mess did to him.  Rey deserved better than what this nonsensical mess did to her.  The audience deserved better than what this nonsensical mess gave it.  Star Wars fans everywhere deserve better than what this nonsensical mess delivers.\\n\\nDisney ruined every character they touched and this story should be thrown out of Star Wars canon before it finishes its theatrical run.","true":true}
