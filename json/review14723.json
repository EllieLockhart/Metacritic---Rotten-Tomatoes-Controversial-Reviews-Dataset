Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how\\, as a fan of previous Star War movies\\, you wouldn't like this Star War. It does all kinds of Star War stuff from front to back. The characters are great\\, and the action completely revolves around their decisions and their arcs\\, the battles are spectacular\\, the visuals are stunning\\, the production design is excellent\\, and the porgs are cute\\, dammit. Loved it\\, can't wait to see how this story finishes!","true":true}
