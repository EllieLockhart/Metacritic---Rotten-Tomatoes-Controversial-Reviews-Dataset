Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was amazing! I loved what they did with the characters and the twists in the movie are genuine. The film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and although the movie was amazing there were some flaws. Especially with Finn and Rose's story arc. Overall the film was exciting enjoyable and lives up to the rest of the films in the franchise.","true":true}
