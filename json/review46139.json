Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waited 6 months to rewatch\\, what an utter waste of potential. Thru the lense of a stand-alone film\\, this would be fine. However\\, as part of a larger story\\, with such a deep deep mythos\\, it fails on nearly every level. Director should have been given a Star Wars take ala rogue one or solo. IMO","true":true}
