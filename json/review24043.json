Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill tried to warn us... never left a Star Wars movie feeling this disappointed and not interested in the next instalment. The Star Wars brand has taken a battering in the last two months and this will not help.","true":true}
