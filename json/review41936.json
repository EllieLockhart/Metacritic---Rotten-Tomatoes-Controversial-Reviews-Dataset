Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie just doesn't hold up. Too many dropped subplots\\, pointless side plots\\, and literally the slowest spaceship chase in all of movies. They're literally crawling through space as all of the \\\"Leaders\\\" in the movie make the worst possible decisions they can. Luke teaches Rey nothing and Snoke just is gone. And I don't even want to get started on Phasma. I actually thought this movie was alright the first time I saw it. Now I'm seeing that it's subpar. Disney and Lucasfilm\\, this is the greatest most influential movie franchise in history. Do better.","true":true}
