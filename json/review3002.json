Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad mix-copy of TROTJ and TESB\\, the all story has no credibility nor logic. Most of the characters are irrelevant\\, useless\\, political just like the arcs that put together with no sens\\, conducting the story nowhere. The force users are super heroes\\, the humour is more than out of place\\, luke isn't what he should be (i can't kill my father... but my nephew while asleep and in the back... yes we can!). \\nThe \u00ab\u00a0lost\u00a0\u00bb generation (yes the old tv show sensless) has destroyed every series they have touch\\, proving each Time that they are unable to write a coherent plot or saga (you don't creat stories as they come through inspiration of the moment!?). My Childs went to the cinema for the first time\\, waiting for the Next episode of a long love saga... they where bored to death during the show\\, and didn't recognize they universe. Thanx for the money saving on the rest of the saga\\, and other products.","true":true}
