Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with plot holes\\, inconsistent character behavior and pointless as well as boring action scenes the movie was a pain to watch. \\nIt hurts to see the character we love and waited 2 year for to show no development througthout the hole movie. The force awakens left us with an interessting scenario (Finn in coma\\, Ray finds luke)\\, open question (Ray parents\\, What's up with Luke)\\, mysterious characters (Snoke)... The last jedi ignores some of does\\, destroys others and creates nothing new thats of any interest.\\nTonaly the movie doesn`t know where its at. Humor is horroblly missplaced in every dramatic scene.\\nI was exited to see this movie\\, buz it left me shocked and I have no intresst what will happen next. I will only watch episode 9 because J.J. Abrahams is back and TFA was a good movie.\\n\\nPerhaps it's worse than thr prequals\\, not sure if it is quite as bad as episode 2.\\n\\nHave a star is too good of a rating\\, but I dont know how to make it zero stars. I only created this account to make this review. #iAmALittleBitUpset","true":true}
