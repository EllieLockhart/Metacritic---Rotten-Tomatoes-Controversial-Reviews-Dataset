Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Criticism 1 - the characters. It's true\\, the main heroes are too perfect. They're either too good at everything\\, or too idealized\\, or a combination of both. It makes them feel more like caricatures than actual characters\\, and therefore hard to get invested in. Like\\, look at how the movie treats - as a random example - Rose\\, in comparison to Han in the old films. It's obvious the filmmaker loves Rose too much and really\\, really wants us to like her too; and it paradoxically makes it harder to like her because it feels like the movie is trying too hard to make her likable.\\n\\nCriticism 2 - the Plot. It is full of plotholes.\\n\\nThe entire premise of the main part of the film is that the Resistance ships are low on fuel\\, and the First Order is going to chase them until they can catch up. The First Order could simply hyper-jump ahead\\, turn around\\, and catch the Resistance on the way back. There\\, now I've broken that part of the plot.\\n\\nOne sub-plot is that Poe sends Finn and Rose on a mission and blah blah blah\\, none of that matters\\, because it could have been avoided if Admiral Holdo simply told her forces what they were doing\\, which she obviously did at some point\\, because they started doing it. Now I've broken this part of the plot as well.\\n\\nMeanwhile\\, Rey is trying to get trained by Luke\\, who refuses to help her. Why does he refuse to help her\\, when the entire previous movie was about finding the map HE LEFT BEHIND in case the galaxy needed him to find him so he could help? There\\, now that part of the plot is broken... or did I break the previous movie? I don't know.\\n\\nThe point is\\, each and every part of the plot was terrible.\\n\\nCould say more but this movie was so terrible that I don't want to think about it. I will never watch any new Star Wars and will consider the old EU canon.","true":true}
