Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst movie in the franchise.  Most reviews cover the fact that bombs dont fall in space\\, lasers are not shot an an arc\\, the asinine Leia space-death-resurrection\\, and all the other plot holes.  However\\, most atrocious to me is the huge missed opportunity of Rey not joining with Ben to rule the world... or at least try to.  A epic civil war could have ensued with thousands of plot possibilities.  Instead Rey decides to leave the most powerful army and military in the hands of Kylo and General Hux... 2 madmen.  That is like leaving Hitler and Himmler in charge of Germany in 1939 when you had opportunity to diffuse the situation.  She doesnt even kill them or arrest them!  Just hands the keys back over to the death star and walks away.\\n\\nThis movie is a joke.  Intellectually stunting.  Disney has made its position clear... ESPN and Star Wars are dead.","true":true}
