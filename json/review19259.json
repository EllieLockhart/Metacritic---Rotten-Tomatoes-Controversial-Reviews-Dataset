Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s not as good as the original 3 but it\u2019s not as bad as the 2nd 3 either. It takes some liberties with the Force that are entertaining and expand it a bit which was interesting. All in all an enjoyable time. ","true":true}
