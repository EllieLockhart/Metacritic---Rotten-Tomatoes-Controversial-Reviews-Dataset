Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"they definitely burned it to the ground as advertised... evil you are a fan of the original films\\, rebels\\, clone wars\\, the books... if you are a fan of sith or jedi\\, yep just forget everything you know\\, because apparently no one cares about anything related to the universe of star wars and just want one dimensional characters who do things like commit treason on a whim twice\\, or try to run away afraid\\, or consider murdering children... everything you've ever loved is wrong and pointless now... thanks Disney.   at least we got a lot of pointless battles that made zero sense and contributed nothing to the story and a few new totally unlikable characters while they destroyed the ones we used to love... and made everything \\\"wrong\\\" for the sake of... a lot of unnecessary long as hell pointless moments.  If this isn't an attempt at creating stockholm syndrome in your fan base\\, I am going to just pretend star wars ended before these films.","true":true}
