Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie!! Laughed and grinned all the way through. Great character development. Disappointed in all the fanboys who idolised a kind of saint-like Luke and found that his character is actually three dimensional and beautifully flawed. Twists and turns and epic scenes.  Wonderfully crafted addition to the Star Wars journey exploring the force and balance and the never ending cycle.  Bring on episode viii.","true":true}
