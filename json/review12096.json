Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am 32 years old\\, I grew up watching the original trilogy. I stood in line for 8 hours when the first prequil came out\\, the prequils were underwhelming but they still felt like star wars. This movie failed\\, and i mean failed bad. If it was just one movie ot failed i could live with that but it ruined the entire franchise. Let me be clear. If you can get past the plot holes and someone flying through space. It isnt a terrible movie. But to be one of the main movies in star wars and not a spin off like rouge 1 is beyon dissapointing. It took a part of my childhood that i loved and it killed it. I don't care what happens now nor do i want to see anything else about dtarwars. Congratulations rian you are the killer of a franchise.","true":true}
