Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved Star Wars when I was a kid. I wasn't big on the previous film but I figured I'd go check this one out anyways when it hit theaters. After the film ended\\, I told myself this is the last piece of Star Wars media I will ever consume. 2 years later\\, I haven't looked back and I haven't regretted it.","true":true}
