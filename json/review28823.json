Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rather than reiterate what countless others have said are faults with the movie (I agree with almost all of them)\\, let me digress and say what I think is the most fundamental flaw of not just this but the entire trilogy.  Its ok to have different directors for some or all of the films. The problem lies in that they have been given creative license to write the story on the fly. Most film \\\"trilogies\\\" are based off of books\\, stories\\, or some sort of pre-planned framework with how the story is supposed to go.  This is not Fast and the Furious when each film can be something on its own.  If the major plot twists ad character arcs in TLJ where what were planned\\, fine.  Then TFA could have been written more to set these points up. But that is not what has happened here. In fact\\, the worst possible thing has happened\\, which is the 2nd director wrote a new story\\, with new plot points that negated everything set up in the first film\\, and now we have the first film's director coming back to do #3.  He has a huge dilemma--ignore film #2 (like #2 director did with #1) and go back to the film #1 themes\\, or pretend his first film never happened and pick up the story where #2 leaves off? This is what happens when the story is made on the fly\\, folks. In a Trilogy\\, you expect pre-planned continuity of some sort.   The formula doesn't have to be the same with prior Star Wars Trilogies\\, but there needs to be a formula\/script that you stick by. I think perhaps that is what frustrates me the most with this film.  That\\, and the fact that the characters and story are not memorable\\, they are nothing close to the memorable characters and dialogue from the first Star Wars trilogy.","true":true}
