Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was a slow and overall boring movie that was missing that Star Wars luster. It was obvious Rian Johnson has more in common with George Lucas than we all thought with his love of CGI and unnecessary comedy. What hurt this movie most was the blatant disregard for the plots and story lines set up by the previous movie. Hopefully JJ Abrams can come back and redeem the franchise and come full circle with the next film.","true":true}
