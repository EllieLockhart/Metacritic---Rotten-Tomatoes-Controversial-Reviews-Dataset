They spent years building it to that degree and their is always risks with strangers\\, but there is HAS to be some form of vulnerability to allow a camp to grow that large. There has to be some form of trust. Joel had a moment of vulnerability\\, it's a human mistake.For anyone that actually completed the game the whole theme was about how cruel life can be and how one decision stretches to affect everything around them. Decisions made by all characters which were masterfully portrayed and the very real threat that life could end at any moment. This is a MUST PLAY.
