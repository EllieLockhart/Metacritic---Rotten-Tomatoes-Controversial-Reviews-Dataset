Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson had the bravery to take Star Wars in new directions and it pays off. Not everything is as you would expect or want\\, but that is what is great about the film. It takes you on an emotional journey that hits you when you are not looking.","true":true}
