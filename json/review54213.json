Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are under the age of 7 years old you will love this movie.\\nit's a silly\\, unrealistic even by hollywood standards train wreck.\\ni will let the social engineering aspect of this movie slide with out comment.\\nit really insults the iq of fans & frankly reveals what hollywood thinks of its audience.\\ndisney i thought would improve on SW after lucas.  now Sw has slid even farther into the dustbin of history.","true":true}
