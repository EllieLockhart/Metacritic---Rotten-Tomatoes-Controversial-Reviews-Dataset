Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Felt like a slap in the face tob Star Wars fans. Filled with leftist political ideals\\, terrible jokes\\, and character defimation. Dont even get me started on the plotholes! This is the worst Star Wars movie\\, I eould much rather watch The Room on repeat.","true":true}
