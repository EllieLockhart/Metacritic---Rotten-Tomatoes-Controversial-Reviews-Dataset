Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge SW fan\\, I enjoyed this film while I was watching it. The visuals\\, the music\\, all were the typical top-notch quality we've come to expect. It's the story and the direction that are poor. While I did appreciate some of the jokes as I watched it\\, I felt they went a little overboard with the humor. Not every movie has to be Marvel-tier quips and snarky one-liners. Kylo was great\\, Poe and Finn wasted\\, Rey completely wooden and shallow. Snoke was interesting before his unceremonious demise. Luke was pretty great as funny Mark Hammil\\, but overall so much wasted opportunity. After such a long wait since 1983\\, this is all they could come up with for him to do? Also\\, the political pandering was really unfortunate. I won't even take my kids to see this because of it. One viewing from me\\, and that's only because my friend bought the tickets ahead of time and we always go together on opening night. Again\\, I enjoyed the spectacle as I watched it\\, but it left me with an empty feeling upon reflection. I actually felt insulted when Luke tossed the saber over his shoulder. To me it signaled that the whole movie was basically a parody of Star Wars\\, which is later confirmed with the hilarious ironing scene later on. All in all\\, a huge misstep from Disney\/LFL and one I'm not sure they'll be able to recover from. Hopefully the progressives on the left will decide to start having kids and buying the merchandise for them\\, because I sure as hell won't be. After two years of trying to coerce my kids to get into Star Wars\\, I am officially throwing in the towel. Rogue One was good though\\, but could have been so much better without all the studio interference. At least it felt like Star Wars. I don't know what these new episodic editions are\\, but they're certainly not geared toward my demographic.","true":true}
