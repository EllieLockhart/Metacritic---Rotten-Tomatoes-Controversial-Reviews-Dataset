Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yikes.  Did Rian Johnson ever see a Star Wars movie before piloting this steamy pile of crap?  No closure on the new characters from TFA\\, totally underused them to give us Rose\\, the most useless character since Jar Jar Binks.  I actually like Benecio del Toro\\, but his part was very minor...maybe we'll see him in episode 9?\\n\\nComedy was forced and unfunny.  Dialogue was weak and what they did to Luke was a travesty.  He was going to kill his nephew in his sleep?  The same Luke who refused to kill Vader?  Ok.\\n\\nI'll see episode 9 as long as Rian Johnson isn't at the helm and the annyoing Rose is not in it.  Otherwise\\, thank you Star Wars for the decades of entertainment but I'm out.","true":true}
