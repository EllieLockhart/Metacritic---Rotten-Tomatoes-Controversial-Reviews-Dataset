Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With a strong direction and plenty of risk that shake up star wars whole saga the last jedi proves to be a great ride. The show is stolen like the original movies by mark hamill as the beyond broken luke skywalker who's first words in this movie are of a tired old man saying\\,\\\" GO AWAY.\\\" Never thought we'd here luke say that did we? The overall movie follows heros who find out what its like to lose and overcome it and it puts the final film of the saga in a place to go where we never have. a rehash of revenge of the sith or return of the jedi seem out of the question. Though the film sometimes doesn't feel like a star wars film and dismisses some fans by throwing around some side plots that did not need to be there\\, the last jedi still thrills as after the mediocre phantom menace and bad Attack of the clones we have gotten 4 good to great star wars films in a row and the franchise has never been more alive.","true":true}
