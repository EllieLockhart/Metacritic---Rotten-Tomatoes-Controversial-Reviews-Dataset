Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rose crashing into Finn was amazingly bad. How did Disney not see all the flaws in this script. Dozens of story plot holes. How\\, why did this happen to Star Wars. Movie looked good visually\\, although story was a mess. : ( I actually cried after seeing it\\, Star Wars has been ruined.","true":true}
