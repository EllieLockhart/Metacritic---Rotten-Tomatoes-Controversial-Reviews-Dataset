Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What???  Who paid \\\"fans\\\" for the 5 star reviews? No character arcs\\, no theme\\, subplots that went nowhere\\, and they essentially destroyed characters (good and bad) for no good reason. All rules of good storytelling were totally ignored - don't show us stuff that does not contribute to the story or advance the plot or characters. They absolutely wasted Luke and Leia. Not only that but they actually made me NOT care about characters that were once likable. That is truly an accomplishment. Way to go.  J.J. Abrams will truly prove he is a genius if he can reverse the damage done here with Episode 9...if there are any fans left to watch it","true":true}
