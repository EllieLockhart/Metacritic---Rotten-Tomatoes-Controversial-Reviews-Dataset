Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may be the longest Star Wars movie in the saga\\, and 2.5 hours sounds like a long time on paper. But in actuality\\, the time sure flew by.\\nFrom beginning to end\\, my dad - who has only watched the original trilogy and is a casual fan at best - and I - who have watched both the prequels and the sequels and avidly followed the Expanded-Universe\/Legends before it was retired - were glued to our seats. The film managed to strike a fine balance between character development and propulsive action\\, and in a rare feat\\, also managed to honor the saga's past while forging new paths forward. While I enjoyed the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" two years ago\\, it is only now that I am truly excited about seeing the future of \\\"Star Wars.\\\"","true":true}
