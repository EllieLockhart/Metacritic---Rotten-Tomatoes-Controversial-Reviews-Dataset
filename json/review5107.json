Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics Consensus: Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for...\\n\\nThis is what is posted on this very website in regards to the critics consensus to the movie. Okay\\, maybe if this was a standalone movie\\, but it is not. It is part of a saga\\, that has been created a long time ago and has a rich lore. This story does no honor to Star Wars; it craps all over it and wipes it all away.\\n\\nI always made a big deal about Star Wars with my children. The Force Awakens was okay\\, I was willing to wait and see what they built into it because they had many possibilities with the plot points at the end of that movie: Rey's lineage\\, who is Snoke\\, what will happen with Luke\\, how will the galaxy fight the first order now that both sides are weakened\\, and more. Also\\, Rogue One was fantastic. But after this movie\\, unless I get my pants blown away by some magic\\, and with Rian Johnson at the helm I am not expecting it\\, the Star Wars series will be allowed to slide into a \\\"to watch on DVD\\, if at all\\\" movies.\\n\\nLet us simply start with the writing: Rian Johnson basically took all of the cool plot points from TFA and threw them out the window: Rey's mystery? Normal. Snoke? Powerful but easily defeated. Useless story arch about making a political point going to a casino planet? That absolutely had to be in there\\, why? Luke Skywalker basically being a non factor and then killed (Everyone wanted to be Luke\\, Han\\, or Leia when growing up\\, by the way). All the old characters are dead\\, and are now replaced with new characters that have little to no character development and depth. The coolest character is Kylo\\, but he is conflicted. There is no overwhelming\\, unstoppable bad guy (Vader and emperor types) because no matter what\\, Kylo gets beaten by Rey\\, who apparently can pick up training just by taking a crap. Also\\, all of a sudden\\, the first order took over everything because why? Didn't they just have their massive death weapon blown up at the end of TFA? So how did they go from that to all of a sudden they are everywhere? Also\\, Leia survives in space with some new Jedi power\\, when she has never been trained... how?!?! Would have worked well had they just let her die there since she is actually dead in real life! It was a powerful moment in the movie... but no. Shit all over you all.\\n\\nMark Hammill himself has stated it best: this movie is written by children. Lucas may had been flawed\\, but he had his vision and linearly made it happen\\, without crapping on all of the created history. There was so much that could have been done. I would have been okay with letting Luke die had he come out and actually put up some type of fight and be a martyr that lit the spark of the rebellion... but no.\\n\\nIf Rian Johnson is allowed to keep going\\, this series will turn into a farce.\\n\\nThere are cool visuals and battles. Rey and Kilo scene in the throne room was great. But again\\, right there\\, Snoke.... Snoke basically is a magnificent villain. He is tossing Rey around\\, who has so much raw power\\, like she is a rag doll. Snoke should have been the unstoppable\\, fearsome power that is oppressing the good guys. He was so powerful\\, yet could not detect that the old lightsaber\\, right BY HIS SIDE\\, was clanking around.... fine. You want to kill him off? Make it a struggle and breakthrough for Rey and Kilo having to surmount and defeat him.... bad\\, bad writing.","true":true}
