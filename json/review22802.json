Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loads of things wrong with it.\\n\\nLeia able to move herself back to ship when unconscious\\, frozen\\, not breathing. \\n\\nRyu able to lil Snoake just by turning a light sander next to him around and switching it on.   Then not using any force powers on the guards. \\n\\nShips have shields that block attacks only when suits the poor plug.  X wing just fly up to biggest ship no issue. \\n\\nPointless sub plot.\\n\\nPointless furbies.\\n\\nPoor acting\\, humour\\, and hippy sayings.\\n\\nI wouldn't watch again nor buy.","true":true}
