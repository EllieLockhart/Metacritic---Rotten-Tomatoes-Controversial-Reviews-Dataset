Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WORST STAR WARS EVER!  Ruined what little hope I have in the new movies. Force awakens I didn't like but this is AWFUL. Nothing redeeming about this pathetic piece of trash. THANKS DISNEY FOR KILLING STAR WARS","true":true}
