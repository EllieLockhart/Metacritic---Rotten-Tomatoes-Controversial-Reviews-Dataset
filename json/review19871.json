Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was better than the Force Awakens...but in my opinion that's a low bar. Also I don't understand what people are saying that it's SJW. It's not that SJW at all. My biggest problem with the new Star Wars movies is that they're boring and predictable and they try too hard to deliver fan service. It was a bit too long and some parts were anti-climatic. The whole casino planet arc could've been cut out. The fight scenes were mediocre at best. And I hate what they did to Luke's character. In conclusion it's a mediocre film.","true":true}
