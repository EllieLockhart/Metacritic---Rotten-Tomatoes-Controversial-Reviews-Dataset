Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney really dropped the creative ball on this movie. 2 hours and 30 minutes of spinning the wheel and destroying the characters episode 7 set up. Good at first but cannot stand up to any kind of scrutiny. Would recommend if you don't care about plot holes or lack of continuity with the previous movies. 1\/5.","true":true}
