Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst SW movie of the bunch.  What they did to Luke Skywalkers character is shameful.  One of the iconic hero's of cinema reduced to a weak\\, triggered\\, emo-jedi in need of an entire planet as a safe-space.  The did you wrong Marc\\, they did you wrong...\\n\\nThere was little character development overall-Finn and Rose story arc was superfluous\\, Rey story arc is a hot mess (parents? powers?)\\, all Kylo does is whinge\\, Poe is an idiot.  These characters are becoming unlikable(they did not start at that way)\\n\\nMovie got a too little political\/preachy for my tastes-if came of as dross and clique.\\n\\nFranchise truly jumped the shark with that Leia flying through space garbage-just horrible.\\n\\nI guess Chewy 3PO and R2 get killed off in VIIII?  I won't be watching...","true":true}
