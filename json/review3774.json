Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between killing the entire buildup from The Force Awakens to blatantly copying Empire and Return of the Jedi to ignoring classic Star Wars traditions to trying to turn this movie into a comedy\\, this movie was terrible and after it I felt like I am done with the entire series.  Only because JJ Abrams is coming back for Episode IX am I considering renting it after it comes out.  But no way am I paying to see the continuation of this story in theaters.  Only reason it's not a half star rating is that it had one or two good scenes\\, but that's about it.  I recommend NOT watching this movie if you love Star Wars.","true":true}
