Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will entertain the Star Wars aficionado\\, yes a big word I know\\, but no disappointment here great effects\\, and story. Just keep in mind the size of your drink-- movie is a bit long.","true":true}
