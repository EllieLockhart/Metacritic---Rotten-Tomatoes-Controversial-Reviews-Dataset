Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I think this is an okay movie. Obviously not great\\, but better than the prequel trilogy. I know a lot of fans are losing their minds over this\\, and I can definitely see where they're coming from. However\\, in my opinion\\, it's a decent attempt that is flawed\\, but not the utter travesty people are making it out to be.\\n     First of all\\, the visuals are amazing\\, and the plot is ambitious\\, if a bit all over the place. I can see some genuine attempts to mirror Episode V\\, and mostly that brought a smile to my face. The things a lot of people are raging about\\, I didn't mind. The Porgs and the jokes weren't too much of a problem to me\\, and helped to keep the film from getting too dark. The treatment of Luke is\\, yes\\, a disappointing addition\\, and perhaps the biggest mistake of the movie\\, though his final scene was lovely\\, and the shot of the twin suns on the horizon was a nice touch and helped to bookend his narrative.\\n     Holdo\\, I must admit\\, was an utter dumpster fire of a character. She is totally unlikable from start to finish\\, and as many other people have pointed out\\, her smarmy arrogance is the catalyst for almost all the tragedy that happens in the movie. If she had simply explained things to Poe like a mature adult\\, her plan would've gone off without a hitch\\, and half the rebellion would not have been slaughtered. Hell\\, Luke might've even survived\\, since without the base being under attack he wouldn't have had a reason to intervene.I Her death at the end is less of the heroic sacrifice the movie seems to want it to be\\, and more the film's real villain getting what she deserved.\\n     Other than that\\, the rest isn't too bad. The bombs seem to have been given a push by that rack descending\\, so them \\\"falling\\\" towards the dreadnought was more of them floating in the right direction. The scene with Leia was probably a bit camp\\, but I've got no issue with the physics. People can survive in vacuum for a minute or so\\, even without space magic\\, and her \\\"flying\\\" was clearly just Force-pulling the ship towards her\\, which propelled her instead because she has less mass. Overall\\, I think a lot of the fan rage is justified\\, but the rest is just grasping at straws. \\n     Then again\\, I didn't think the Justice League movie was that bad either\\, so take my opinion as you will.","true":true}
