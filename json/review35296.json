Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The hate for this movie is ridiculous. People hated TFA because its too safe\\, people hate this because its too different.\\nThis is on par with Empire Strikes Back in my opinion.\\nPeople forget even ESB got hate and the original trilogy has flaws. But they are forgivable flaws because we just except that stuff after 40 years.\\nIm just scared all this hate is gonna end up making episode 9 the safest peice shit mess ever.\\nI say lets see what they have for us.\\nI loved it","true":true}
