Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is fantastic. The graphics are insanely good\\, but the story is god awful. The developers tried to push an SJW political narrative and it falls flat on its face. When the majority of the fans complained about this\\, Neil Druckkman had the audacity to call the fans of his game sexist\\, homophobic and transphobic. It\u2019s insulting to the people who loved the first game and all of the amazing characters it had. Now the fans are stuck having to spend time with people like Lev and Abby. Nobody cares about these stupid ass characters. Dont buy this game\\, Naughty Dog does not deserve your money. If you really want to play this game\\, rent it or borrow it from a friend. Im sure gamestop will be selling their hundreds of used copies for like $5 anyway.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
