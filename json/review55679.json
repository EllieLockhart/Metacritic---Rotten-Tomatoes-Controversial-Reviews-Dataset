{"101487":159038,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-11-12","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ok. I enjoyed the superb visuals and the production design was as amazing as ever. perhaps even greater than ever. Some of the twists I very much enjoyed but overall the plotholes and lack of tension were the greatest downfalls of this movie. Considering a huge chunk of it is an extended chase sequence in space\\, I never really felt the pressure from the first order's attack. Also\\, the whole finn\/rose relationship seemed contrived and while I liked benicio del toro's presence\\, I feel like his character was just a stand in for lando calrissian essentially and the casino planet was like something out of the prequels. It also really ruins the supension of disbelief that they had to cross the entire galaxy to find the \\\"codebreaker\\\" and that maz durr would now exactly where he was and what he would be wearing\\, and then it just so haappens that they ened up in a cell with the tonly other person who could run this mission and then on topof it\\, he was just chilling in the cell by choice as he could've helped himself out of it at any moment? lols that whole subplot is like somethng out of a spoof. In much the same way that the force awakens (aka new hope reloaded) felt like a carbon copy of a new hope\\, this feels like a bit of a retread from the empire strikes back. I don't really appreciate what they did with leia and luke either\\, I feel their character's arc could've gone much differently. I did enjoy it and the visuals are certainly eye-catching\\, I just wish it had gone somewhere else I guess\\, still way better than the force awakens","true":true}
