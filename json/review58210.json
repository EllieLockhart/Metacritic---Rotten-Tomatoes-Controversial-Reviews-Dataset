Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zu viele unpassende Gags und Einblendungen von Albernheiten.\\nWER zur H\u00f6lle war SNOKE??\\nDer Casinoplanet so was von schlecht umgesetzt - Der Handlungsstrang war schlicht \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig!\\nAnspruchslose und Sinn freie Kommentare.\\nEine gro\u00dfe Entt\u00e4uschung.","true":false}
