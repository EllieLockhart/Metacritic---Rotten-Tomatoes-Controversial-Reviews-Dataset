Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well done Rian Johnson! I liked the storyline :) i love that it had its own tone and felt different to the other movies and showed me different things. Laura Dern\u2019s character\\, i liked :) i liked it a lot! (Trying not to say too much at this stage :)) ","true":true}
