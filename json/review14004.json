Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you just focus on the auteuristism of the direction and theming and over look the piss poor script\\, littered with a constant mood that betrays the mess of a plot conflated with MCU levels of pointless quips and oneliners\\, and the flanderization of all the characters; than sure\\, maybe you could come out thinking it was okay.","true":true}
