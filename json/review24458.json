Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More than 35 years ago\\, one of the most iconic brands in US history decided to change the formula for its success- literally. Coke had been dominate in the marketplace for nearly 100 years at the time. From its southern roots to the spread across the globe\\, Coke became one of the most prominent brands in US history. In fact\\, during WWII\\, despite the rationing of sugar\\, Coke was exempt due to its importance to American morale. \\\"Every man in uniform gets a coke\\\". By the 1980s\\, Coke's dominance appeared to diminish when taste tests revealed an approval rating of 12%\\, compared to Pepsi's 11%. Coke thought America preferred the less fizzy\\, sweeter taste of Pepsi\\, thus the change in formula. Coke did thousands of taste tests in various markets with the new formula\\, then rolled it out. It's now widely regarded as one of the biggest blunders in US corporate history. Fans revolted. There were boycotts\\, a spread of activism and media coverage\\, despite the existence of social media\\, a grassroots campaign was born. 79 days later\\, the CEO of Coke admitted their mistake and reversed course. And in the end\\, it all worked out of for Coke\\, but only because the original coke was brought back. \\n\\nEarlier this month\\, another iconic brand in the U.S attempted to change their formula. Much like Coke\\, Star Wars felt 40 years of success needed a new taste\\, a new formula\\, for a new generation\\, if we're still using cola analogies. Rian Johnson\\, the newest director of Star Wars sought to change this formula with his vision\\, doing away with 40 years of great success. With Luke Skywalker\\, he destroyed the most iconic cinematic hero for multiple generations\\, rewrote the rules of the force\\, eliminating the Sith and Jedi dynamic\\, and failed to explain characters that required explanation. The Force Awakens gave one of the easiest hand-offs to its next director\\, only requiring a custodian to continue where it left off. Instead\\, Rian Johnson appeared to make a movie independent of a trilogy\\, and the star wars universe as a whole. Like Mark Hamill said\\, \\\"Not my Luke Skywalker\\, maybe Jake Skywalker\\\". It should have been very clear with The Force Awakens and Rogue one\\, with the appearance of Luke and Vader in each\\, and how this changed each movie\\, how excited everyone was. \\n\\nOne thing Coke failed to measure in its quest for change\\, for a wider market share and more money was what this would do to the customers and fans of Coke original. Sure\\, new Coke may have tasted great in taste tests\\, just as Last Jedi tastes \\\"OK\\\". But if you take away the 40-year history of Star Wars\\, and give us The Last Jedi\\, it tastes awful. Coke became more than just a cola drink. It was part of the fabric of Americana. A coke and a hamburger. It was woven deeply into the fabric of society. Star Wars became more than a movie. Star Wars and a Coke\\, not a New star war and a New Coke\\, but Star Wars and Coke. Star Wars is on its way to a very disappointing box office in comparison to The Force Awakens. Reviews are scathing\\, fans have revolted\\, setting up a terrible box office for the 3rd installment\\, then the trilogy Rian will work on\\, hundreds and hundreds of million dollars gone. \\n\\nin 1985\\, coke had an easier fix by bringing back the original. Star Wars is in a much more precarious position because of what this director did\\, it won't be as easy to just bring back Star Wars\\, the original formula. In fact\\, it might be impossible. The next director\\, JJ Abrams\\, will need to be extremely creative to unravel the damage. In short\\, don't fiddle with success. If you do\\, be very\\, very careful.","true":true}
