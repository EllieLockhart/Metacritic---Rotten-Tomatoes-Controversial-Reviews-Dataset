Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is Not Star Wars to me ... after the new movies the expanded universe no longer exist and the meaning of what is the force and jedis are not presented properly in this movie... Seems that George Lucas is the only one who can do a movie of star wars because he is the only who understand the universe who created... the new movie in particular seems like a bad fanfic...","true":true}
