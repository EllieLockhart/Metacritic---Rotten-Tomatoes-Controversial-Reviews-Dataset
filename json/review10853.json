Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has some upsides\\, but mostly feels like another disappointing money-grab. More time spend planning merchandise than story. The film loses whatever promise \\\"force awakens\\\" left for it\\, and runs with its worst. what feels like a huge step in the wrong direction\\, sad to see something so big so poorly done..","true":true}
