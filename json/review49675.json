Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what a huge disappointment!!! How could you mess this up so badly? I am 50 years old and grew up on Star Wars. My kids are in college and high school and love the series as well. All of us were crushed by how bad this Star Wars movie was!!! The movie had no heart and every time there was a chance for a heavy or meaningful scene they would throw in so badly timed comedy that really felt awkward. The movie jumped all over the place with so many meaningless tasks and side stories. Main characters did things sooo out of character it was like they purposely tried to mess up the great vibe that Episode 7 set up for them. I could go on and on\\, but don't want to drop spoilers. What a sad sad day in the world of Star Wars!","true":true}
