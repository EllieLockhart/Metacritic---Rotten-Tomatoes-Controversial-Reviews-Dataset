Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gorgeous visuals\\, better choreography\\, same mediocre and predictible writing but nothing I didn't expect from a Disney movie. Also there are too many plot holes in this one.","true":true}
