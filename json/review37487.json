Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some good elements in this film but it's really overshadowed by the many inplausibilities. Why are there only 20 tie fighters for a huge new order fleet? They could outrun the resistance ships even if the cruisers couldn't. Luke dying at the end didn't make any sense and the slapstick kids comedy with the weird creatures was very reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks. The creatures would have added more to the film if they didn't exhibit so much emotion. Also Chewy would have eaten the hell out of that firby penguin. The film doesn't really answer any of the major questions from the force awakens. This is easily my least favorite Starwars Film. That said the lightsaber battles were dantastic and the new creatures all were cool in concept. Only the over cartoonification of the firby penguins made them suck.","true":true}
