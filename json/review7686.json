Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Example of a story-less movie made by tick-the-box social statement committee. Diverse actors are of value if you give them good stories and roles. Leia was an amazing female character who was good because you had strong male characters also - this one buries every guy into idiocy.  Plot contradictions and holes even a non-fan finds annoying.\\nEven from a franchise\/profit perspective the lack of character (vs socio-political) driven narrative and story means that they have created forgetful characters that means the $4bn franchise will slowly die only carried along by the fans of the original.. \\n\\nAnd LUKE!! the amazing naive farm boy who suffered and a trained his way to become a Jedi Master who redeemed his father.. suddenly becomes a milk-sucking idiot who unbelievably sees evil in in Kylo and draws his lightsabre? REALLY\\, 10 years of character driven development THROWN DOWN THE DRAIN.\\n \\nThis would have been one star if not for the amazing effects and sound. Rogue One shows what happens when you concentrate on Story and Character and guess what and strong female lead and strong male characters also -\\n\\n LOOK DISNEY YOU CAN HAVE BOTH STRONG FEMALES\\, STRONG MALES AND STRONG STORY.  KATHLEEN K - YOU SHOULD BE FIRED FOR DESTROYING A $4BN franchise by socio-political dull committee.","true":true}
