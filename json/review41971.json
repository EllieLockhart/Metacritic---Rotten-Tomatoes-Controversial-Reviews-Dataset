Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed the star wars myth.  Slapstick humor\\, plot holes beyond count\\, and just bad character development. What was even the point of this movie? it felt like a big slap in the face to actual star wars fans.  Pathetic","true":true}
