Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incoherent mess of bad pacing\\,  expository writing\\, forced jokes\\, one liners and beyond obvious sociopolitical messages. \\n\\nIt also destroys most of which TFA build towards to in the most anti-climatic ways and ignores defining character archs build in the previous trilogies. \\n\\nThis just may be the worst Star Wars film to date and makes me doubt the quality of the future Star Wars films to come. \\n\\nI wish i didn't spend over 20 bucks for a ticket to see this. Rian Johnson should be removed from Star Wars since it is obvious he doesn't understand what makes it special.","true":true}
