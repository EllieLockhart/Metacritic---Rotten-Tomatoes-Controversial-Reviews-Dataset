Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to see a movie that is basically a knock off of a previous version\\, go see this movie. While I was hopeful that there would be  original content in this movie\\, I was disappointed. \\n\\nWhy does Rotten Tomatoes ignore the audience review scores so blatantly?? That this movie has received any kind of award is horrible and makes me doubt the validity of this websites goals.","true":true}
