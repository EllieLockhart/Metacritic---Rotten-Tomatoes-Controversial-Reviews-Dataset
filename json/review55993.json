Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this in theaters and waited a few days to review just to make sure I wasn't knee jerk reacting. This movie is just awful and boring. There are some interesting visuals\\, but the plot makes no sense and completely takes you out of the story. Every time it gets to a decision point\\, it consistently picks the most boring direction to go in. It goes on really strange subplot tangents that don't really relate to the story at all and makes no sense. It destroyed a lot of the characters in The Force Awakens by making them really go in directions that don't make sense for how The Force Awakens built them up. They also failed to have any kind of a cliffhanger for IX and I'm left totally bummed and not at all excited for what happens next. It's not worth the watch unless you just want to confirm it's terrible for yourself. I really wish someone had spoiled it for me so that I wouldn't waste my time or money. I will not watch another Star Wars movie without carefully checking fan reviews to avoid making this mistake again.","true":true}
