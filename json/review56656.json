Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi tries so hard to tick every casting box that it forgot about plot or character development. Instead it feels like a bubble test where they skipped the first question: \\\"tell a story\\\" and now they've gotten a flat zero.\\n\\nI didn't like the previous movies\\, but they had their moments. I thought I would give the franchise one last shot. But this has turned me off it for good\\, and I won't be wasting my time and money watching a movie that took it's inspiration from a combination of Chinese government propaganda and tumbler posts.\\n\\nI can enjoy even the most poorly made movies\\, so long as they are sci-fi\\, but I found myself wanting to leave the theater halfway through this movie. This was a first for me\\, but there was genuinely nothing enjoyable about this movie.\\n\\n\\nThe pros:\\nThere are light sabers.\\nChewy shows up for a second.\\n\\n\\nThe cons:\\nCharacters are forgettable and make no sense\\nThere is no plot\\nAll Males are evil and all women are virtuous\\nWatching mold grow in the shower is more entertaining.","true":true}
