Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a phenomenal movie\\, with fantastic acting and new directions for the franchise to follow. Rian Johnson directed a bold and fresh movie\\, and I can\u2019t wait to see what comes in his spinoff trilogy","true":true}
