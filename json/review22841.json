Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long\\, complicated and changes rules of the universe to \\\"force\\\" an outcome. This film\\, Disney's first to introduce completely original content to the Star Wars saga (The Force Awakens being a re-boot of A New Hope and Rogue One being the prequel to ANH)\\, Rian Johnson and crew decide to confuse activity with progress. \\n\\nAs a 40-year loyal fan of the franchise\\, but not a fanatic\\, my new hope is that TLJ is not the mile marker that reflects the beginning of the end or\\, more likely\\, the George Clooney-led Batman & Robin of a series that must ultimately be completely overhauled.  \\n\\nWhile the film is not without its entertaining moments\\, my score reflects how far TLJ fell short of reasonable expectations after The Force Awakens.","true":true}
