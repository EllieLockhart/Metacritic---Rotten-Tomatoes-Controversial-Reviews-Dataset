Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel that all characters in the last Jedi have experienced no character development and are the exact same as they were at the beginning of the force awakens. They also killed off many characters with plenty of potential and they gave the fan favorite admiral ackbar a poor death.","true":true}
