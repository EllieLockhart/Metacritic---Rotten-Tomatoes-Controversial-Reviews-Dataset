Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. What a mess of a plot with gaping plot holes. The only way to explain the critics\u2019 higher ratings is that Disney paid them. Without getting into any spoilers\\, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like a Star Wars film. It\u2019s a hybrid between Marvel\u2019s Avengers and the recent Star Trek films. No questions are answered\\, and it adds nothing to the epic tale. Indeed\\, due to poor writing\\, it seems like some questions will never be answered. There\u2019s no soul and no sense of wonder to this film. There are story arcs and characters that are completely unnecessary. Given its 2 hour 31 minutes length\\, a much better story could easily have been fashioned by cutting 40 minutes of pointless characters and plot lines. I had hoped following Episode VII\\, bit this is the worst aberration of this great franchise. ","true":true}
