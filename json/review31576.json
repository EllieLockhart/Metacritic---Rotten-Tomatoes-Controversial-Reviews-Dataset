Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much of the criticism aimed at this movie misses the themes it's meant to convey. I loved that Rian subverted my expectations and what us fans thought was going to be a focus. Unlike its predecessor TFA\\, this was a fresh and innovative Star Wars film and in my opinion it was the better for it.","true":true}
