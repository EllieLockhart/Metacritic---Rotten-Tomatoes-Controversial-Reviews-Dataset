Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi really advances the newest trilogy forward. There are so many amazing moments that just make you want to clap\\, and also moments that make you want to shed a tear. The cast was fantastic and I really can't wait for the next chapter to see what else unfolds. Still so many questions\\, but yet some have been answered from The Force Awakens. I don't understand the negative ratings with this movie. Everyone really did a great job to say the very least.","true":true}
