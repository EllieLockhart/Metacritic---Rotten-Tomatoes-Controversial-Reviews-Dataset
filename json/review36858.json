Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was alright. I had high expectations for where Star Wars was going but this was not how I thought it would turn out. Lots of unnecessary parts that were boring. There were some exciting parts but they seemed to just hit a brick wall as soon as it reaches its peek.","true":true}
