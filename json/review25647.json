Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect film but very surprising\\, took every fan theory and shit on it. Enjoyed it very much for the risk it took with such a big IP. \\nMoreover I made some quick bucks for writing this shit on Rotten Tomatoes.","true":true}
