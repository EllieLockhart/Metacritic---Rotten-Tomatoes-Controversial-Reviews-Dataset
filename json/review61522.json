It's sad and disturbing to see this game getting so much hate for having certain messages. Claiming the game went \\\"political\\\" when really this game just contains a narrative that can't be found in many games. The story is breathtaking\\, every character has their own unique personality\\, and the character development is nearly perfect. I've seen many reviews ofAbsolutely fantastic game.

Claiming the game went \\\"political\\\" when really this game just contains a narrative that can't be found in many games. The story is breathtaking\\, every character has their own unique personality\\, and the character development is nearly perfect. I've seen many reviews of people saying that Neil Druckmann didn't stay true to the characters. This is wildly inaccurate.\r\rTrauma has shaped certain decisions of characters in the game and the writers make it feel very realistic. This Naughty Dog project was very ambitious and they took a risk on telling the story that they did. This is not a game that contains the same kind of story as the first one. We get the characters that we love but we play a brand new story. Yes\\, we lose some characters that we love\\, some sooner than most fans would have wanted. However\\, this is a plot based on revenge. How is the game supposed to start without a motive for this kind of plot?\r\rThe game stays true to the characters\\, the game has brilliant story telling that will keep you at the end of your seat and ensure that your controller is covered in sweat. The ending is controversial\\, that much is true. I was upset at first but after thinking of the characters involved and how their choices were influenced\\, the ending is justified.\r\rPlay this game if you love plots and characters that drive the story of this world forward. Play this game if you want to experience something that will grip you and touch your emotions. Don't play this game if you want a copy and paste of the first game\\, you'll be very disappointed. I apologize for the long review\\, I tried to cut it down as short as possible pertaining to all that I had to say.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
