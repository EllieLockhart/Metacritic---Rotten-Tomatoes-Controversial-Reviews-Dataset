Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the franchise! I'd put it right below Empire and A New Hope. I enjoyed nearly every scene in this movie\\, which is impressive given its length. My only real complaints is that it could have done with some more strict editing and there's a subplot in the second act that I thought was stretched out a bit too long. This isn't your dad's Star Wars movie. With The Force Awakens\\, J.J Abrams set to restore our hope in the franchise by hitting similar beats to the original trilogy\\, particularly A New Hope. With The Last Jedi\\, Rian Johnson steers the ship in a nearly opposite direction\\, striving for something new and fresh\\, unlike anything we've ever seen in the franchise. This is a bold\\, brave movie that takes a lot of risks. The ending left me thinking \\\"What the hell is going to happen next?\\\" and I love that. I have no idea what to expect from Episode IX.","true":true}
