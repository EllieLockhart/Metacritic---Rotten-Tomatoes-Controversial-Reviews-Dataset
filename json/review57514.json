Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good movie.  The most conversational dialogue of all the Star Wars films\\, with genuine reactions.  However\\, I understand the frustrations expressed by other reviewers.  You can not build up questions and theories for two years and then leave so many unanswered or unfulfilled.  Additionally\\, there were parts that could have been completely omitted (chunks of Vegas-like planet).   I think the broader messages of the film\\, along with it's originality in telling the story\\, are great...that's what brought up to 4 stars for me.  You can't squawk about the supposed rehashing of Force Awakens and then complain about this movie's format.  The old constructs of what Star Wars is needed to come down in order for it to survive going forward.  Watch it again with an open mind and I think you'll see what I'm talking about.  Thanks for reading and enjoy the ride!","true":true}
