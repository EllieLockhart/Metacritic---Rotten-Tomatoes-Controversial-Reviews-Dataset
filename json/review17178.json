Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked the movie\\nThe good action\\, an interesting and unexpected story\\, and the excellent game of Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.\\nThe film has problems like Finn and Rose's story that was pretty boring\\, and Rose and Snock's characters were not bad but rather boring.\\nBut I still enjoyed the film very much. The problems do not change for me because they are only a small part of the film but in general it's a very good movie.\\nAnd for my taste this is the best movie of Star Wars since the Empire\\nStrikes Back","true":true}
