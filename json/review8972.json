Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From ruining the best character in StarWars to having military blunders so massive they built a film on them lol.\\nThis movie is weak right out of the gate.\\nNot sure why Luke doesn't have some sort of scene where Rey bends him over to be honest\\, that seems to be all that's missing.\\nI don't know what they were thinking with this movie.\\nCrazy powerful Rey who is powerful just cuz decides what's right for the galaxy..... great.\\nWhere's the Republic during this entire movie?\\nI could go on for days about this movie and how horrible it is.\\nThis movie dose have something positive about it however\\, and that's the amazing visuals.\\nEach scene is shot beautify and has amazing visuals.\\nI just wish the movie made more sense in the starwars universe.","true":true}
