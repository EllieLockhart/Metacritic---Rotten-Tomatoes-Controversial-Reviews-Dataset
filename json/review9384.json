Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Given what the film had to work with leading in from The Force Awakens\\, I thought I wasn't going to like it. I love it when I'm proven wrong. The beginning had me think it was a rehash of the events on Hoth\\, but minutes in\\, the sequence of events became and remained unpredictable\\, keeping me on edge about what would happen\\, and the homages to the original trilogy were spot on. This movie more than made up for the shortcomings in The Force Awakens. They did a fantastic job.","true":true}
