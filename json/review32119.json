Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers. They ruined luke skywalker. The movie can be summed up as every decision a major character makes is wrong and gets people killed. I liked force awakens. This was depressing and a terrible end to characters we know and love. How quickly rey masters the force with a lesson and a half from luke is still lame as well. They had an amazing setup with intrigue and people wondering who rey and snoke really were and they squandered both fan amazements. Only reason it isn't 1 star is the acting is top notch.","true":true}
