{"101487":175535,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-10-30","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is tolerable if you just want to watch something to pass the time\\, beyond that its a huge failure\\, the story is inconsistent\\, a side plot that takes half the movie with no payoff\\, and actions by some characters that generally just make no sense and shows a lack of proper writing","true":true}
