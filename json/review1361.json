Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A ripoff of ESB and ROTJ and very disappointed to say the least.  Plot holes abound and the themes don't make sense and literally spit on George Lucas' movies and simply ignores EVERYTHING those movies did and created.  I am so sad and so shocked how depressed I was last night after watching it.  Just unbelievable","true":true}
