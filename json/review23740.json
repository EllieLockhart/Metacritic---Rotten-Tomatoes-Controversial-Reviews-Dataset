Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker declares\\, 'this is not going to go the way you think' and those words encapsulate the roller coaster ride The Last Jedi takes us on! An out-of-the-box Star Wars entry\\, which takes the story and characters to new heights\\, and sets up a highly anticipated climax! Is it perfect\\, no\\, but the movie is Epic\\, and will leave your head spinning\\, by throwing conventional wisdom into the trash compacter\\, and heading full-speed into hyperspace!","true":true}
