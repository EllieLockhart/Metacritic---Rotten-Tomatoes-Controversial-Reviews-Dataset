Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film is made beautifully\\, no doubt about it but man\\, so many plot holes and scenes (minutes actually) which easily could be skipped - just pointless really..\\nAnd the big things like what is happening with Luke and Snoke..   \\nI must also say that these \\\"funny\\\" parts are just sometimes not really funny and in many cases are interrupting.","true":true}
