Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined star wars. I hated so much about it\\, Other than the Kylo and rey story. This movie was bad bad bad. So many PLOT-HOLES and RIDICULOUS choices. Just such a DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE.","true":true}
