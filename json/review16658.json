Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly lack luster\\, I've never needed relief from such an overwhelming amount of \\\"comic relief\\\". Most scenes were illogical\\, and dry. They took out all suspense by making a joke every 7 minutes making scenarios that you were directed to be concerned about felt meaningless. The actor who plays Kylo Ren (Forgot his name sorry) makes Haden Christensen's Anakin look Grammy award winning. They took an immediate misdirection with the power of Snoke\\, (SPOILER ALERT: They Darth Mauled him) I could go on forever on the atrocities and disappointments I witnessed on the opening night of Star Wars the Last Jedi\\, but I'm afraid it'd make a better story than the movie itself.","true":true}
