Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Riddled with plotholes (Poe and Holdo). Too long due to unnecessary plot lines (Finn and Rose). Demolishes any mysteries leftover from previous movies (Rey and Snoke). Potentially worldbreaking mechanics (suicide hyperspace jumps). Completely abusing the force (Skype calls and holograms). Subversion of expectations used to undercut the audience's emotional response\\, rather than to genuinely surprise (Luke). Teleportation and time management problems (how did they get there so quickly?) And to top it all off\\, it's literally a slow motion car chase.\\nBut it does have spacecow milking and superman flying through space.","true":true}
