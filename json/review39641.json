Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This hyped up Movie \\\"Star Wars the Last Jedi\\\" was everything you didn't expect and didn't want to see.  If you enjoyed the past Star Wars you will most likely be \\ndisappointed in this one. There is also no true  Lightsaber Duels.","true":true}
