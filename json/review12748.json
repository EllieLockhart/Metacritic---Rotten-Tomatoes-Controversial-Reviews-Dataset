Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account to write this review. This movie was a huge disappointment. I would call myself a \\\"moderate\\\" Star Wars fan. Certainly watched and enjoyed all the movies\\, but haven't read the books or taken part in the video games that this franchise has cranked out. This movie is full of cringe-worthy dialogue\\, gaping plot holes\\, cute and irrelevant (and marketable) bambi-like animals\\, terrible in-your-face one liners\\, side stories that lead to nowhere\\, an unrecognizable and cowardly version of Luke Skywalker (arguably the most iconic action movie hero of the last century)\\, a complete disregard for all of the fans who spent two years debating questions posed by The Force Awakens (surprise\\, none of it matters!)\\, a complete departure from anything resembling a hero's journey\\, a surprise cameo by Marry Poppins\\, and an incredibly boring slow-motion space chase in a movie series where the amount of fuel a ship has available has never been a factor. I have no desire to see Episode IX. Disney and Rian Johnson\\, congratulations\\, you have killed this trilogy and the future of the franchise. I'm just gonna watch the new Bladerunner again instead; at least it's devoid of unnecessary cute animals and Disney one-liners. This movie is a joke\\, and I find the critical praise being heaped on it both dumfounding and suspicious.","true":true}
