Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"was truly a slap in the face to fans who were excited to see the Luke Skywalker we grew up to\\, who being on the cast made massive profits to everyone involved only to be told fuck the Luke Skywalker Hero arc\\, Fuck lightsabers\\, Fuck Jedi\\, and media is lapping it up like the dogs they are \\\"we needed this\\\" no we didnt the movie is ass anyways and you deliberately shit on fans. Yeah i wanted to see Luke be a badass and duel with a lightsaber and you shitheads needed me to feel that way for profit. Mark Hamill is never going to be in an A list role again\\, the man is in his 60s and he was so disgraced and mistreated\\, a titular character in the story an iconic figure in the fandom and yall just fed him to plot device in some shit that dont even make sense. Just remember Mark told you this wasnt gonna work and in your hubris you refused to listen. Shit the bed big time Disney","true":true}
