Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once more people see it the hype will die down. Not a terrible movie but my god does it have it flaws. Disney just gave a big f*** you to all your Star Wars questions. And I loved the forced awakens so I'm not some die hard original trilogy fan. It's like the they only wrote the story to throw people off instead of oh idk\\, telling a good story.","true":true}
