Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was sad to see Star Wars turned into a silly facsimile of itself. The visual effects were incredible though. Rey and Kylo Ren work very well together. Unfortunately it was a disaster for the Star Wars universe","true":true}
