Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great special effects and fight scenes.\\n\\nThe story is garbage and a big thumb in the eye to fans who follow\\, yes follow\\, the journey started 40+ years ago. Just way to dumb a script to be considered anything but a marketing ploy. Way to say f u to JJ Abrams and the story of the Skywalker's and their friends.","true":true}
