Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a fun intense grad experience. I really liked Rouge One and believed it was better than the The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi in my opinion is the best film since The Empire Strikes Back\\, i truly expected a cliff hanger and interestingly I thought the movie was over three times before the end. It was a long epic story with just the right amount of drama\\, comedy and story\\, excellent!!!","true":true}
