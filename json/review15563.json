Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the characters and story that the force awakens set up but this movie was full of plot holes and failed to capitalize on the good work set up by JJ Abrams installment. It feels like the studio decided to write the series in a new direction right after the force awakens was made. Full of elements that pulled you out of the story and felt completely disconnected from the rest of the series.","true":true}
