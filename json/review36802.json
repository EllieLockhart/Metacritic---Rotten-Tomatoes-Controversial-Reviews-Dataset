Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie sucks. But it's fine for kids. There are too many plot holes. Bad script and disrespectful lines for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Disney make a mess on this one. Watch it in tv but don't make them rich for doing just a merchandise and PC princess movie.","true":true}
