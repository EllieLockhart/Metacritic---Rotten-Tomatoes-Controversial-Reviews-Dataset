Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The storyline in this game was generic and repetitive especially in the second half of the game. The cycle of revenge between either side was pointless and what I mean by repetitive. Spoiler Abby killed Joel. Then Ellie wants revenge. She killed all the group of the Salt lake squad. Abby finds out and went to confront Ellie. She killed Jesse and let Ellie go. Few months\/Years\\, Ellie wants revenge again and asked Abby to fight her. After all\\, this happened\\, She let her go. So repetitive! Ellie killed a pregnant woman and all Abby's friend and she didn't kill Ellie? Because the scar child gave her a look? But she brutally killed Joel. We all know Joel was not a good guy. He was a smuggler and a murderer before he met Ellie. He didn't even want Ellie. However\\, there should be justice like Arthur Morgan in RD2. He is still a character we loved. I don't mind if he died really. All decision has consequences. Also\\, the fact that you are playing the person that killed one of the major characters that you love in the first game and tries you to feel bad for this person that you really don't care. I was on Ellie's side all the way. I get why she has to kill Joel but I really don't care about her which ruin half of the game. If Abby's story was a DLC then I probably wouldn't mind. I also like to point out that Ellie's storyline in Seattle was more of a generic video game story. Like you have to find and kill the other people of the group before you fight the main boss. That's a Basic storyline. What happened to the emotional storytelling for example when Joel fell from the balcony and got stab by a pipe or something. He nearly died. He was sick for a month and Ellie was captured by a paedophile and was about to get abuse. Joel has to save her but she's the one who killed the man. That was an emotional scene and a perfect example of great storytelling.\rI agree with the mechanics\\, graphics\\, AI\\, etc. It's impressive\\, beautiful and the fact that PS4 released 7 years ago\u2026 Expand","true":true}
