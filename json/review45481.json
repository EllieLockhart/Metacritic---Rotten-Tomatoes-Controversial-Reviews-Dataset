Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in the film. The Force Awakens was good as a reboot to the franchise (essentially a new Ep4)\\, but this films story was just terrible. Finn and Rose's parts were terrible\\, as was Benicio del Toros. That could've saved us 30 minutes\\, and could've been used to reinforce the plot. Without giving anything away\\, the two main things fans were looking forward to were a bust. And the added comic relief was too much. The film was good for what it was\\, another Star Wars movie....signed\\, A disappointed fan.","true":true}
