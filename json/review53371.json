Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't expect it to be a serious drama\\, but it had way too much campy humor.  The chase plot is weak.  The Casino sub plot was pointless in many ways and shoe horned in.  Luke was underutilized.  Don't even get me started on Leia.  I'm usually easily entertained and very forgiving of movies\\, I loved Force Awakens and Rogue One.  This was a major disappointment after waiting so long.  There are a couple redeeming factors\\, like some ship battles and light saber scenes\\, but overall I was underwhelmed.  I hope Episode 9 can get this back on track.","true":true}
