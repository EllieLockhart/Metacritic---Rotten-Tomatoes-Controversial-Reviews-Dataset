Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely abysmal. To start of spoilers. This movies gets everything wrong with Star Wars to start of the nonsensical killing off of Admiral Ackbar and doing it off screen\\, the man deserves a heroic death. He should have died with his ship when they went to light speed instead of that useless girl (whom I don't even care to recall her name that's how important she is). Leia going out in space then flying back was beyond cringe. The Finn and his supposed girlfriends plot was a waste of time to show off compassion for abused animals and to make a huge dis on capitalism but at the same time show how capitalism made the rebellion in the first place. The ray and Luke scenes were great although Luke was not Luke in this he wasn't at all himself and was written totally incorrectly. Would have love to have seen more time with them. Learned about who snoke was and not this bs about anyone can be the next greatest Jedi. (Don't get me started on how crazy powerful ray is without learning a single thing about the force.All around SQW movie that destroys the true meaning of Star Wars which shouldn't be for a political message but for the fans and no bias. All in all I hope to never see this movie again and or for a very long time. I don't think I'll be purchasing it until it's beyond dirt cheap. Fix this. Remove this movie from cannon and rewrite it all. Fire the director and things will be better. Thank you.","true":true}
