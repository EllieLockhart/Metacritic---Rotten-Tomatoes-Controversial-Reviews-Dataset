Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot stress how god-awful the direction\\, plot and character development is in this movie. Visually stunning\\, yet completely lacking in substance and heart. Rian Johnson does not know Star Wars and his middle finger towards the best fanbase in the world was clearly evident with this horrid excuse of a film.","true":true}
