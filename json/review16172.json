Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm having a hard time understanding some of rave reviews this is getting. I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, and this movie was too long\\, too muddled\\, too cold (I barely felt connected to any of the characters)\\, and was full of terrible dialog and not-so-great acting. And the furry bird things were an unwelcome harkening back to the Ewoks. There are some great moments but they are few in number\\, and the plot moves all over the place without skill. Poor writing abounds. Rogue One was massively superior to this installment.\\n\\nMark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (rest in peace) never were great actors\\, but it's particularly bad in The Last Jedi. The other actors do a passable job but the direction managed to leave us cold and disinterested. The music was fantastic\\, and of course the visuals were insanely great. But the rest of it was simply not up to the standard that was set with Rogue One.","true":true}
