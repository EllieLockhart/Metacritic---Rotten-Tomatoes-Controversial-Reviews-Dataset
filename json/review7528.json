Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is complaining Luke is not some all powerful Jedi Master that is God like. Really think about Yoda he had hundreds of years to master the force but was pretty much turned into Palpatine's beoch. Then he in turn was killed when Vader threw him over a railing where he fell to his death. These masters had years on Luke but were defeated\/killed rather easily. But some of you expected him to be a God with a fraction of the time to learn the force??? Guess what this isn't the comics you need to get over it.","true":true}
