So disappointing and disrespectful to everything that the first game accomplished. I really hope that everyone who is feeling like me can caste this game aside as the egotistical fantasy of the main developer and maintain the memory of the first game and all the amazing aspects that made it unbelievably good.\r\rApart from the incredible design\\, this was a betrayal not only of the fans\\, but of the actors and the original developers\\, many of whom were not apart of this game as a result of internal politics at Naughty Dog. No wonder it was horribly disconnected from the first game. It is not an incredible world that one can be immersed\\, lost in a riveting story and provoked to think about difficult aspects of human nature. It is rather a failed attempt at shocking the audience while including unnecessary contemporary politics\\, which are important in their own right\\, but feel totally out of place in this game.\r\rIt feels like they have tried to maliciously ruin everything good that players hold in memory. This is purposeful but I believe it is not justified and after 7 years\\, I highly doubt that they made any attempt to get input from the most important people: the hard core fans\\, high profile streamers and original creators of the game. As stated above\\, it feels like a betrayal and a fulfillment of an agenda that is disconnected from everything that could have made this game a worthy sequel.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
