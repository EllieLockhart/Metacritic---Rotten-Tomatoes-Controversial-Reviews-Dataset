Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The jokes are immersion breaking\\, cheesy and very out of character\\, very messy scene order and cuts\\, the most beloved characters of the franchise have been soiled by piss poor writing\\, the plot so far\\, which may have been somewhat worthy of the franchise\\, is executed horrendously\\, this is not the vision nor direction of George Lucas and it shows.","true":true}
