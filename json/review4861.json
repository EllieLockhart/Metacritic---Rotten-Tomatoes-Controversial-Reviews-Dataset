Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Congrats on hi-jacking Star Wars and destroying the main character. Childish at best....if you appreciate male's taking a secondary role\\, this beta male montage will suit you. Appreciate the anti-male sentiment and twists as females take control of \\\"the galaxy.\\\" Men = weak\\, stupid. Women = smart\\, strong. If you have an issue with this in 2017\\, you must be a sexist.... carry on crap craft-makers.","true":true}
