Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going to steer clear of some of the hyperbole around some people sharing their considered thoughts on this movie.  Apparently it's either the worst SW movie ever\\, worth half a star or it's the best thing ever at 4 and a bit or 5 stars.  For me it was a 'good' Star Wars movie.  Apparently there are franchise fans who are quite precious about how their Luke should be portrayed.  And now we have what we got and they somehow feel betrayed?  First world problems and all that I guess?  I am not precious\\, and kind of expected Rian Johnson (writer\/director) to actually do something to elicit some sort of response in fans\\, and a response he got.  This is not the Luke we've come to expect.  We had The Force Awakens that people complained about for being a New Hope remake\\, ignoring the fact that this was what so many fans crave\\, and yet here we are\\, 2 years later.  A SW movie throwing expectations all out the window\\, and somehow royally pissing off some entitled people.  Oh the betrayal of it all.. get a grip.  You know who you are. The worst Star Wars movie?  Worse than Attack of the Clones? really? Jar Jar?  Young Anakin? Old brat Anakin? hello?\\n\\nThe movie isn't all roses\\, I didn't think the Maz scene was necessary\\, and would have liked more Luke\/Rey as opposed the Finn\/Rose sub plot.  A sub plot that didn't really go anywhere except to set up a fail\\, and set up a little easter egg at the end of the movie.  However\\, I will give it that the fail was unexpected.  Likewise\\, Poe's constant cock-ups.  These are flawed heroes here\\, if not executed exactly right.  Why didn't Holdo just tell Poe her intentions and save all the hassle\\, etc. \\n\\nFor me it's a movie that deserves another watch\\, and I really believe that in spite of a few short comings\\, it is NOT the worst SW movie\\, it's bold\\, ballsy and for me\\, a welcome SW movie.","true":true}
