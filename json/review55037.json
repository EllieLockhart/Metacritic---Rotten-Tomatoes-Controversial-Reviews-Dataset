Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been interested to see a lot of the criticism of this movie\\, because I really do not agree. I'd start by saying this movie is at worst the fifth best Star Wars movie out of 9 (counting R1). Even if you have a problem with one arc\\, like some people do\\, or with another key moment\\, this movie gives you arguably three of the top four singular moments in the series - with the fourth being the reveal that Darth Vader was Luke's father (in Empire). The acting is phenomenal and gives you everything you could possibly want. A lot of the comments I've seen seem to indicate users are mad that Rian Johnson didn't make the exact movie they were predicting. Well\\, guess what? Sorry he didn't make your movie. He made a better one.","true":true}
