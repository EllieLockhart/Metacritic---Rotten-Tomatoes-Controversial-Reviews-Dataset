Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i dunno\\, i didnt feel the same excitement that i did leaving the last one...a lot of questionable scenes.Had its moments though.  The last 1\/3 of the movie picked up\\, I just dont really have the desire to watch it again either. Meh","true":true}
