Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film provides a new direction for star wars movie\\, straight to hell....It proves that they don't care about the fans that put their effort and time in analyzing\/attached to the plot.Characters are coming in and out of this film freely\\, this is worse than the grand central station.\\nThe film pay no respect to Fisher(Leia) by playing her death with our emotion.\\nYou can have new stuff in the new trilogy\\, but don't fundamentally change the star wars mythology\\, it shows that how are not you prepare for your trilogy","true":true}
