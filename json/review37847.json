Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some thrilling great parts to this film.  Adam Driver is the main star and steals the spotlight with another great performance\\, but some elements of this story just seem to be made up on the spot and don't tie into the Force Awakens or Star Wars as a whole.  The side story for Finn and Rose was a complete waste.  My theatre cheered when it looked like Rose died.  How do you waste an actor like Benciio Del Toro?  This film will show you how.","true":true}
