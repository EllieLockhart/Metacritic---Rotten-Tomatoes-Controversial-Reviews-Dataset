Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film felt like such an insult to the Saga. Much like Johnson didn't care about respecting the series instead pushing whatever agenda or story he wanted\\, often squeeze it in where it doesn't seem to fit making the overall movie feel amateurly put together. Overall summary is there was much that didn't need to be in the movie\\, and much that wasn't in the movie that needed to be. Very disappointing follow up\\, and I'm very hesitant about the follow up to this one.","true":true}
