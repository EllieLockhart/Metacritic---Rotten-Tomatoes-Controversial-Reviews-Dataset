Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who has grown up with the StarWars franchise and has always loved it\\, it pains me to say that this movie is just bad. The amount of plot holes needless themes that go nowhere and make no sense mods the plot immensely. Everyone I know who has been a fan of StarWars hated this movie. The SJW agenda in this movie is so blatant and poorly executed. Thank you Kathleen Kennedy and that idiot of a director Ryan Johnston for ruining the biggest and most loved franchise in history. I hope you're proud.","true":true}
