Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated the opening scene\\, we waited and waited with huge anticipation on what was going to happen and he throws it over his shoulder...come on...WTF...the whole movie sucked...all the jokes and comedy\\, this is Star Wars not the 3 stooges...there should be some comedy and one liners but Rian took it too far in TLJ....and totally and completely disrespected Luke Skywalker.......","true":true}
