Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly soulless and disgraceful\\, no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Did not remotely feel like a Star Wars movie whatsoever.  Terrible dialogue\\, weak story line\\, like a 2 & 1\/2 hour long toy commercial.  So disappointed - WHY did JJ Abrams not make this movie!?!??????","true":true}
