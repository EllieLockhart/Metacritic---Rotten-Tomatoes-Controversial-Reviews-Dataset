Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best looking SW movie ever\\, very well acted\\, awesome score\\, horrible unoriginal story and even worse character treatment. It has the tools and the pieces to be a masterpiece\\, but makes the worst and stupidest decisions at every turn. A clusterf**k of missed opportunities. My disappointment cannot be overstated.","true":true}
