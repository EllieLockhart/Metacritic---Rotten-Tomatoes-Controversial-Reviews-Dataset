Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie really killed Star Wars for me. I would have probably accepted it more if it wasn't called Star Wars. Just doesn't seem to fit into the entire Star Wars universe which I have come to know. Dissapointing. The original follow up books and story (eg with Mara Jade etc) is so much better. Effects are great though but sadly that is about it.","true":true}
