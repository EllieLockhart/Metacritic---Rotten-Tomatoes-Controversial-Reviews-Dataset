{"101487":152204,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie.  Reading through the negative reviews\\, I notice very few of them give any real reasons except for fanboys who are mad because their favorite theories from YouTube were tossed like Luke tossing his saber . . . to the garbage.  The same people nitpicking about every single flaw in this movie are the same people who gloss over the problems that existed in every Star Wars movie\\, like how highly-trained clone soldiers can't hit the broad side of a barn or how AT-ATs are the most inefficient ground deployment weapons ever.  Were there some things I didn't like?  Of course\\, but nothing of great substance.  The problem with some so-called \\\"fans\\\" is that when a movie set in the fashion and pace of movies from 1976-83 sets the standard\\, there will always be the nostalgic who can't embrace the future.  They want a slow movie with long drawn-out dialogue\\, like . . . .ding\\, ding\\, ding\\, most movies from 1980.  This movie had everything from great acting\\, script\\, conception\\, continuity\\, etc.  Some of the comments make me think people went into the movie WANTING to hate it.  Like how could Luke be that way?  Well\\, Luke pretty much explains to you throughout the movie\\, EXACTLY why he is how he is. SPOILER:  How did Snoke not see the betrayal coming?  Uh\\, you mean like how Palpatine was blinded by Vader?  The whole Jedi counsel was deceived by the Sith.  Maybe Snoke perhaps became too confident.  A flaw of all masters\\, Jedi and Sith alike.  Quit complaining\\, people.  Be happy that this universe lives on\\, builds and continues to expand.  It could have just as easily been done in 1983.","true":true}
