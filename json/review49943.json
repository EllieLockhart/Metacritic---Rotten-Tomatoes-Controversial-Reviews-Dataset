{"101487":200057,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know a movie is indefensible when its advocates defend it by slinging mud at its critics instead of making a valid case for the movie itself. Most of the people I see giving this thing five stars are insistent that anyone who disagrees with them hates change and just wants more of the same\\, or in some cases suggesting that they are anti-inclusivity. \\n\\nI\\, however\\, thought that the new direction they are taking things was really cool and admirable. I didn't mind Snoke being scrubbed from the story\\, or that there was no good vs. evil lightsaber fight. I don't even mind the sociopolitical pandering\\, which only strikes me as such because the female characters they use to do so are so phoned-in and forgettable that more than once I cringed with embarrassment for the wonderful actors I watched struggle to fill them out. Not to mention\\, the democratizing of the Force and the championing of society's underdogs rings a little hollow alongside their insistence that gay people do not exist. \\n\\nI really liked what the movie was trying to do\\, but it made a complete mess of itself trying to do it. The end result was a busy blur of completely disposable plot lines and cheap laughs. \\n\\nIt's a compliment to JJ Abrams that I was heartbroken over the disservice being done to his three new leads. Both Finn and Poe's plot lines could have been deleted from this movie entirely and the result would be a stronger\\, more compelling and more concise narrative-which is such a shame because Poe in episode VII is one of my all time favorite Star Wars characters. All three of Rian Johnson's new characters\\, however\\, were completely forgettable and did nothing but obstruct the film's already crippled momentum.\\n\\nI do not reject this movie's themes or intentions; I embrace them wholeheartedly. It is simply a bad\\, bloated\\, sloppy movie that squanders decades of buildup and potential. I realize that  it declares to do so nobly\\, while cramming its themes of \\\"letting the past die\\\" down our throats. But that doesn't make up for its incoherence. The Last Jedi is like a fat drunk guy at a bar\\, raving about how he's going to change things before falling asleep in his own vomit. I wholeheartedly agree with everything he's saying. But I still think he's an asshole.","true":true}
