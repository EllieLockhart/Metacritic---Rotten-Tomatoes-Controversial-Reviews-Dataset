Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waited a while to see if I felt better about this. I didn't. Lots of plot holes. Lots of build up for very Luke. They mistreat his character and the force.","true":true}
