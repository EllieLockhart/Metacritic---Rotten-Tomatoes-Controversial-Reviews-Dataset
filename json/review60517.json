Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is truly incredible. Using both gameplay and cutscenes to tell a heartfelt story of loss\\, revenge\\, and ultimately forgiveness. Since the first game ended I was interest in what would happen from Joel\u2019s choice ( a choice I agreed with). This game does a great of job of living in the results of that. I think once your realize you\u2019re playing through an incredible story and you (the player) are not part of the story\\, it becomes great. Once you invest in the characters journeys and not make it your own\\, you\u2019ll start to see what naughty dog was going for. My only real faults with the game were with mechanics\\, the dogs were extremely annoying and made those sections either avoid everyone or kill everyone\\, same with the stalkers later in the gameDon\u2019t read this part of you haven\u2019t played the game. It basically me going through the game saying parts I liked and parts I didn\u2019t. And as what happen to Joel happens and you go down Ellie spiral you start to see how Ellie is so different from Abby in her desire for gruesome murder. Then the switch to Abby feels foreign at first from the scene you just came from. But as you play and meet lev and it feels very similar to playing as Joel in the first game (a large imposing figure with a archer partner\\, craft shivs). The worse section of the games were near in the end where they made you control Abby in a fight with Ellie when you wanted Ellie to win. And having the game force you to control the enemy and have the computer use your tactics as Ellie was difficult to go through. I think it\u2019s a better game for it but this section was hard for me as a player. The following section on the farm\\, made it feel like the ending which at first I was upset that Ellie lost the big battle ( I really didn\u2019t want either character to die but I didn\u2019t want Ellie to lose). But after walking around the farm I became ok with this being the ending and was happy for Ellie and the life she had. Until the panic attack hits and she goes after Abby again. The ending section on the beach I think was the perfect way to end it\\, Ellie got her revenge but her killing Abby in that moment wouldn\u2019t have meant anything.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
