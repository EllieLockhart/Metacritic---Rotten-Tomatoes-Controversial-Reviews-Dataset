Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney finally destroyed what was left of a franchise that Lucas couldn\u2019t complete with episodes 1-3. The characters were a joke. The writing was terrible\\, i have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this garbage. I had high hopes after rouge one\\, but this was a complete waste of time and money. Not looking forward to the next installment. Everything was so forced it left nothing to be appreciated. I would not recommend this movie...new blood does not mean a better product\\, unfortunately the Mouse as killed this franchise as a pathetic attempt to capitalize on a new audience and ran off the old audience from such a great franchise ","true":true}
