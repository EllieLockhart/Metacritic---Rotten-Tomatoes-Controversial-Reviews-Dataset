Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no room for re-envisioning a nine part saga in its penultimate episode: both The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker manage to beautifully and elegantly show us within the narrative that female characters and POC characters have agency and status...this boring\\, bumbling heap of world-breaking only tells us about it\\, crudely and with little effect\\, placing characters in silly situations that only serve to provide ammunition to naysayers and hate-mongerers. Very poor showing.","true":true}
