Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was utter garbage and did not live up to any of the hype or promises made prior to its release. There are some who will blindly accept the continuity issues between the force awakens and last Jedi such as Hux and Kylo fleeing star killer base only to find hux chasing the rebels on a cruiser and kylo somehow healed from his massive wounds. Yet somehow Finn is still in a Bacta suit.  The Finn\/Rose subplot is completely useless and distracts from the entire money.","true":true}
