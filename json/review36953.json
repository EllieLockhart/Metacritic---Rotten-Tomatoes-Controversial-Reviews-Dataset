Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was mostly boring. Had storyline that didn't have a point. Didn't like how Luke acted in the movie. He didn't even show up for the final battle. That means out of the original heroes \\, only Han and Lei got a chance to get back together again.  Why have them at all? It just wasn't a very enjoyable experience for me.","true":true}
