Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sorry but this has a number of issues. No; I was never a Fan of any of original star wars movies bare in mind. The problem is the last Jedi was confusing with it's lack of sense beginning to end with how the characters take action. How the main character is a mary sue by easily learning everything and SURPASSING her master to the point of being jaw dropping annoying good. As well no aim of a goal for her character still besides not the plot at all cost. The three plots are annoying and bounce around too much. Honestly why are characters being inconsistent?","true":true}
