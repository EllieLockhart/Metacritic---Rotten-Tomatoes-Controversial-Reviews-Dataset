{"101487":153398,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"May the farce be with you...\\n\\nIt's not the \\\"divisive\\\" choices taken with Luke's character. It's not the terrible sub-plots with Finn\\, Rose and Po. It's not the disregard or wasted potential of Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, or Leia doing a Superman impression.\\n\\nIt's the insultingly placed humour that undercuts the emotional impact of every. fucking. scene. I mean seriously. The opening with Hux and Po on loudspeaker is really funny... if it was the Lego adaptation?! Hux is a wasted character\\, seemed a bit off the hook Hitler style in 7\\, now he's just that really angry guy who provides comic relief. Oh wait\\, EVERY character in this film provides comic relief! Yay!...   The jokes and gags weren't not funny\\, they were just so out of place and ultimately has ruined Star Wars. Wonderful. I love it when things become a parody of themselves.\\n\\nYes\\, everything I listed in the first paragraph absolutely grinds my gears. I'm all for taking Star Wars in new directions\\, exploring more aspects of the force\\, new characters taking the story forward. But not when the aforementioned is executed in such a way that it pillages\\, burns and rapes the entire canon back catalogue.\\n\\nCan I believe Luke would act the way he does? No. However\\, if that's the way Rian Johnson wants to take the character\\, cool - but justify it to me. Make me actually believe Luke could take the path he did. Of course he could act out of character\\, but he was written in such a way that the only thing he had in common with Luke is that Mark Hamill played him...\\n\\nHere's my luke-warm response to Rians decisions:\\n\\nFast foward to the end of TFA. The emotional weight and reward of finally seeing Luke\\, both Rey and Skywalker welling up as much as the John Williams score. Snap into TLJ\\, Rey gets the saber out again (wtf continuity rant for another time) and Luke just grimaces and throws it away like a comedy sketch? What the fuck?! The tone of this character is awful\\, there's just nothing in common with what we've seen previously. I must state again\\, I'm all for character development and seeing a new side\\, but this treatment was detrimental to not only everything that had come before\\, but to Luke as a standalone in the movie.\\n\\nI won't deliberate too long\\, can of worms and all... but the flashbacks of Luke and Kylo sleeping?\\n \\nCome on man\\, Luke could have felt Kylo's supposed conflicted feelings without physically waving over his head. The last time I checked\\, all Jedi (including Luke in early stages of force use) could sense presence and feelings from a distance. So now Luke is supposedly diminutive in his force sensing abilities compared to previous movies. Great. \\n\\nThe whole entering Ben Solo's room at night then whipping out his big green is also fucked up. Luke is now a coward for going in Ben Solo's bedroom to attempt murder while he sleeps and his guard is down\\, then he's just a straight up pussy because he doesn't follow through (enter Kylo sith fit wake up routine).\\n\\nRian could have done ANYTHING. But chose this? I cannot comprehend. Luke has seen a lot in the past\\, Dad Vader ring any bells? Guy who pretty much single handedly wiped out the Jedi. So if he sensed dark in Ben Solo\\, it would have been so much cooler if he faced up to him properly\\, fell out with Leia because he wanted to kill her son\\, Han stuck in the middle doing that shrugging thing like when the Ewoks come out of nowhere in ROTJ... there's some great family space opera shit right there! And because we have virtually no back story on the last 30 years\\, we're already robbed of emotional weight. Eurgh. I'm disgusted frankly.\\n\\nSwiftly moving on\\, now I've got the important shit out the way... Finn might as well have died in TFA. The one moment he had any purpose or gravitas\\, Rose (yawn) stops him from committing suicide. Great. What I wanna know is\\, how did Finn drag Rose all the way back from the first order front line into the abandoned Rebel base without getting shot down? Again\\, for another time...\\n\\nRose is shocking. \\n\\nPo \\\"intless\\\" Dameron. Thanks.\\n\\nLeia Superman... so many things wrong with that\\, but bottom line she can't be in Episode 9. Now she's gonna have an expected but underwhelming death in that film. Great. But you killed Luke instead\\, even though Mark Hamill is still alive. Great.\\nAnyway\\, I've gone off on one and missed out loads but hey! Nobody is reading this far anyway.","true":true}
