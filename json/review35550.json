Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a beautiful looking Star Wars movie with awesome action sequences. However\\, what they did with Luke Skywalker was disappointing\\, it was like watching Mark Hamill playing another character\\, and then dies in an unsatisfying way\\, he should have gone out in a blaze of glory. Who was Snoke\\, and what is his story? With all of these issues\\, I would still say it is well worth the price of admission for what the movie did right. Just don't expect hardly any resolution to The Force Awakens setup for this movie.","true":true}
