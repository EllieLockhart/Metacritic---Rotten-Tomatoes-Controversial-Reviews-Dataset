Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was fantastic! Yes Leah does fly through space...but she's got the force folks. She's a Skywalker! Really I'm not sure why many of the fans don't like this film. And they are all angrily coming here to leave their angry comments. Is it the \\\"Sad Puppies\\\" all over again?(Google it?) It does take some unexpected left turns\\, but I loved the breaking of the mold that this film does. If you are even a little bit open minded to the possibilities of other types of characters also being hero's then you will enjoy this film. The pacing was great\\, the characters were actually given depth...gasp! I know shocking for a modern tentpole. And there was humor\\, which I find was missing from some of the more overserious episodes recently. I've been a Star Wars fan since the original...I cried when it left the theaters as a child\\, and this to me was the best of the new films and reignited that spark I felt back then watching the original for the first time.","true":true}
