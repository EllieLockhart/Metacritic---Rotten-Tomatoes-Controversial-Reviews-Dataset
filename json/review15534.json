Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Yes\\, there were some kinda cringe (maybe even useless) moments\\, but man\\, I thought this was the most \\\"Star Wars\\\" style movie of the new trilogy. There were surprises in this movie actually. Originality. I think that compared to ep 7 and 9\\, TLJ will age much better.","true":true}
