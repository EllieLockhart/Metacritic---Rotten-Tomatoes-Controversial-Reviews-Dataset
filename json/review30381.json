Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seen it today. Did not really care for it. Did not hate it\\, but was hoping movie would try to stand on it's on feet without feeling like i was watching parts of the old trilogy.","true":true}
