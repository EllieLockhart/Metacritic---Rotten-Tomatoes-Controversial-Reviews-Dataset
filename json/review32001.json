Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(SPOILERS) At the root of all Star Wars is the Force. A quote from Snoke says \\\"Darkness rises and light to meet it.\\\" It is clear here he is talking about the Force. In every previous Star Wars Film\\, the main theme has been bringing balance to the Force. The Last Jedi finally does brings balance to the Force where every other film has not. If we see the Force as an equilibrium with the light side as positive and the dark side as negative. In the original trilogy\\, the negative dark side far outweighs the positive light side and is therefore out of balance. In the prequels\\, the issue is reversed and although the positive light side is far stronger with the Jedi in their prime it is still out of balance. This is something that Luke tries to tell Rey in this film\\, that the Jedi were not great because they upset the balance. Many people do not like this film because it is telling the audience that their heroes were wrong but Luke throwing away his lightsaber is a perfect replication of the moment in Return of the Jedi where Luke finds balance and overcomes the Emperor.  This\\, therefore\\, makes his character progression in this film the most realistic. He is teaching Rey\\, our new protagonist\\, that the Force needs to find equilibrium and it was out of balance in both the prequel era and the original trilogy. But there needs to be both light and darkness in equal amounts to create balance. In The Last Jedi\\, there is finally a balance in the force with Luke and Snoke are out of the way leaving a balance in the Force between Rey and Kylo Ren. A perfect starting point for a new era. This\\, however\\, is hard for fans because to reach this equilibrium they have to \\\"Let the past die.\\\" This is why through all of the imperfect action\\, side quests and character arcs that has frustrated fans but bulks up the story\\, the core of this film is quietly and beautifully brilliant.","true":true}
