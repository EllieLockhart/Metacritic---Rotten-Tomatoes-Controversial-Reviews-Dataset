Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man\\, I wish this movie were better.  There is good stuff between Rey and Kylo Ren\\, but that's all that I can say was really positive.  If they had given Luke another movie where he isn't a total jerk the whole time\\, maybe it would be more  forgivable.  A lot of the conflict of the movie could have been resolved by some simple communication between characters (Holdo not sharing the actual plan with anyone was ridiculous).  One thing I don't like about all the new movies is that they dramatically shrink the size of the galaxy.  Leave a fleeing ship\\, travel to another planet\\, get thrown in jail\\, break out\\, return to fleeing ship all in less than 18 hours?  Sure\\, no problem!  The idea that the resistance\/New Order is down to a couple dozen people?  Stupid.  Where is the rest of the republic?  I know that some books have supposedly explained away some of this\\, but these movies do not stand on their own.  And like TFA\\, this movie is derivative of the Empire Strikes Back.  Are there really no more stories to tell?  Lifelong fan\\, rather disappointed with Ep VIII.","true":true}
