Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a serious bust. It has a lot of moments to like but can't ignore the questions many are asking about from The Force Awakens. This film is just plot over plot and a boring storytelling that comes down short than what is expected. There were a few scenes that weren't necessary. There's a lot of wrong things in this film. It's for sure entertaining but your expectations for the best characters and pacing issues make this film completely empty. ","true":true}
