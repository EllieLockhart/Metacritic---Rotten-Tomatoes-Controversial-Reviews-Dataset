Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As with any star wars move\\, everyone was going to go see it. However\\, the plot just didn't sit right with me; and as a result\\, I kind of felt both disappointed and underwhelmed. It did have a good comedic dialogue which I found enjoyable. Yet\\, it just didn't make sense and some parts of it were completely unnecessary\\, if not confusing and convoluted.","true":true}
