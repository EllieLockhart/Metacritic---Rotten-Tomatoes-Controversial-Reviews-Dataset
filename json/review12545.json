Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe that I am saying this but the new Star Wars movie was the worst movie I have seen in years. So disappointing! A lot of built up and the worst climax of movie history. Not really any talk worthy light saber action. Everything that happened was just so predictable and has been done time and time before.... in one word: ROTTEN.","true":true}
