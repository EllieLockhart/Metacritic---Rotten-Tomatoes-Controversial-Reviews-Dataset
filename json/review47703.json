Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I left the cinema I felt like this was a great movie\\, I think the visuals hipnotised me somewhat. Having seen it again & had time to think\\, I've realised these Disney movies have diluted what it means to be a Jedi & be able to use the force & a lightsaber. Also the space chase is boring and is on one level as aposed to the 3-d epic space battles in the original & even prequel trilogy. Speaking of which\\, these new movies are making the prequels seem good. There I said it.\\nDisagree with me? Casino scene","true":true}
