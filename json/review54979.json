{"101487":144403,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was a trashy film. The Force Awakens had us introduced us new characters like Snoke and I wanted to know more but only to have them killed off. The Last Jedi is a rip off of  Empire Strike Back and some trances of Return of the Jedi. The character Rose TIco was a useless character that offered nothing to the film and was put into the film to more diverse. There were some funny points in the movie but some of it was in bad timing. Overall it just wasn't a great film. I can critic more but i don't see the point","true":true}
