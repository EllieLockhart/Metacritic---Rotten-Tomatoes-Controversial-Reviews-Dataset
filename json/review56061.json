Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many compelling set ups with so little payoff. After all the hard work that went into Ep 7 story and character development it's so dissappointing to see it all thrown away or just horribly mismanaged... with the exception of a couple of exciting cinematic moments this film was a huge let down for any true Star Wars fan.","true":true}
