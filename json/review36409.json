Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most disappointing film of the saga.\\nLucasfilm has to understand that a film fool of unexplained abilities of the heroes and with a bi-polar attitude that they are not consistent at all in their feelings and their actions is not interesting at all. It's not a problem about challenging the  order of the previews mythology that the funs loved so much. It's the inability to tell a meaningful and captivating story that reflects the reality that we live and experience.\\nThe great effects are not enough to achieve that.","true":true}
