Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately left me very disappointed as a Star Wars fan. Jokes didn't ring through properly and I didn't enjoy the new character that were introduced. Also a lot of scenes that reminded me of Eps: 1\\,2\\,3. Still an entertaining movie but disappointing if you were expecting it to be like The Force Awakens or Rogue One.","true":true}
