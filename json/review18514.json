Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is Star Warsish.  I recognize some of the people and ships\\, but the story just doesn't feel like Star Wars.  Good movies have good stories and compelling characters.  This movie has neither.  I thought Rogue One was good\\, so Disney is capable of making a good Star Wars film\\,  Maybe Rian and JJ  just are not the right people for this job.","true":true}
