Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie completely annihilated a beloved franchise in the most agonizing 2hr33min of my life\\, and without the use of JarJar Binks\\, a feat I previously thought impossible. The only comfort for me is that at least now people won't say episodes 1-3 were bad\\, because they now have episode 8 to compare them to. This movie has turned one of the greatest characters into an alien milking maniac\\, had Princess Leia magically fly through space like an X-Wing\\, and had the all powerful Snoke get killed by a teen who lost a light saber battle to someone with zero training. Imagine every fans worst fears about Disney taking over the franchise. Multiply this by 10. This is what materialized on screen. When Kylo said \\\"let it die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" he was talking about the Star Wars legacy\\, and this movie unquestioningly satisfies this objective.","true":true}
