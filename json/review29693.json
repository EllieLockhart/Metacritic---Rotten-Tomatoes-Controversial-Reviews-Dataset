Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took all the lore created in Force Awakens\\, crapped on it\\, then smeared it all over 2 and a half hours of film. This movie did not feel like star wars. It felt more like a guardians of the galaxy movie. The director gave no respect to the pacing or lore of any of the previous movies and sucked the life right out of the franchise. JJ Abrams really has his work cut out for him saving this mess. This movie ranks right down there with Phantom Menace. Help us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope! Updated from 2 stars to 1. The more I think about this movie the more I hate it. First star wars movie that I didn't see multiple times. May very well skip any future star wars movies.","true":true}
