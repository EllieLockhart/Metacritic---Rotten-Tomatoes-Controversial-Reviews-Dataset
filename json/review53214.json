Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than TFA. Audiovisualy amazing. Pretty good writing. One completely unnecessary plotline of Finn and Rose. Very strange main plotline as well. Not a huge deal. But having to burn fuel to keep the speed IN SPACE?! Ever heard something like: \\\"An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by another force.\\\"? They are in vacuum! WTF? Rey and Luke is interesting but little boring. Less unnecessary persuasion. You can get that done just as well under five minutes. More scenes with training. Snoke went out really early. I liked the way it was done\\, his arrogance killing him. Fine\\, but it could have been way more interesting. Luke shouldn\u00b4t have died. Just no. He should have distracted Kylo with projection and then lived to finish Rey\u00b4s training. And maybe start another Jedi academy with the restored hope and learned lessons. Also Yoda was pretty bad. Some people may have liked him\\, but it just seemed weird.  They tried to emulate that crazy Yoda from Empire before he revealed himself. But after that he wasn\u00b4t super joking semi insane frog. Some more cannon breaking with force ghosts being able to affect the physical world also didn\u00b4t help. Oh and he somehow looks worse than in ROTJ. Enjoyable but had so much more potential...","true":true}
