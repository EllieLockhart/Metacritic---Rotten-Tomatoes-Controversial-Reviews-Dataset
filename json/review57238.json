Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie doesn't deserve the hate it gets.  Don't get me wrong\\, it's not a great movie.  It has a lot of problems.  But being late to the party in watching it\\, I saw it without the hysteria that surrounded it when it was in theatres.  Ultimately\\, this was an uneven movie with a not-bad-but-not-good script that ran too long.  It was shot decently and the visuals are good\\, but not as good as they were in the last Star Wars movie.  The actors saved this movie and Rian Johnson should kiss their asses because without them\\, this movie would have been a clusterfuck.\\n\\nI'm going to get my main complaint done first.  Rose is a horrible character and I don't understand why she exists.  She was annoying and served no real purpose except to complicate the plot when needed.  Her lines were corny and I just didn't need her.  Finn would have been better off working without her.\\n\\nI think Luke Skywalker's character could have been treated so much better by Johnson\\, but Mark Hamill elevated the material to the point where if this was going to be the story given to Luke Skywalker in this movie\\, it wasn't bad.\\n\\nThe same can be said for Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver.  Both their performances were way better in this movie than the last one.  I see Kylo Ren as a real threat now.  Rey's character got better in some ways\\, more confident\\, and I could see her as a powerful Force user\\, but sometimes she was just making dumb decisions to push the plot along or to give the audience some kind of very weird romantic tension\\, especially where Kylo Ren was involved.\\n\\nThis movie did not kill the franchise but it isn't as revolutionary as people believe it to be.  It is a movie you have to pay attention to though.  Moreso than other Star Wars movies\\, the devil is in the details; all the things people claim make no sense (e.g. \\\"Rey can't do X without training\\,\\\" \\\"They changed the Force\\\")\\, do make sense if you pay attention to dialogue.  You might not like some of the choices Rian Johnson made\\, but they all make narrative sense within the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\nBut ultimately\\, the problems were with the story itself\\, not the storytelling.  Rian Johnson had a story he wanted to tell and he told it well.  I just thought it was a meh story.  Ultimately\\, The Last Jedi wasn't so much about killing the past as it was about learning from experience to move forward.  I don't think Luke Skywalker had to end up being a crazy hermit to do that\\, but I didn't write it and I think that hey\\, Luke Skywalker was a hero in the end so okay\\, fine\\, whatever.  The movie is worth seeing once if you're a fan\\, but it's only worth a second watch if you really have 2 and a half hours to kill or if you can't find your copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special; both have the same meh effect\\, but the Holiday Special is a lot more entertaining.","true":true}
