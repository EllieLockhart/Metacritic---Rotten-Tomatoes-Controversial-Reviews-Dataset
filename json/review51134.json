Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible! The worst star wars movie even made\\, i would rather watch episode 1 100 times then have to watch this movie even one more time. Anybody that really knows the star wars universe will hate everything about this movie. I guess Rey is just the strongest greatest jedi ever with zero training? Humm ok I guess so","true":true}
