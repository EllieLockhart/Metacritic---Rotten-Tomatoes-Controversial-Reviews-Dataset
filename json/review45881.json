Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very very very disappointing. Not everything has to be Marvel. They killed a character that could bring way more interesting lore. It tries to be bold but sometimes it just doesn't work. It's shot nicely though but that doesn't when the story is a sequel and they just kick you in the nuts just for speculating. Star Wars is dead. Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope are the only good Star Wars movies.","true":true}
