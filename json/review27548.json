Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall pretty good. The whole movie was too busy for me though. I don't mind some action scenes but it had way too many for my liking. I felt it had two major mistakes\\, which I won't state because they are spoilers. One is bad enough that I will not bother watching the next one- not out of spite\\, but because I have now lost interest. The biggest reason I liked Star Wars to Begin with is no longer a part of the series. I think many will feel the same.","true":true}
