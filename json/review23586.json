Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love everything there is about Star Wars and am even a fan of the Trilogy no one really likes. But The Last Jedi needed more build! The entire time I felt in the same place when I wanted to be taken for a ride. Regardless\\, Awesome\\, Beautiful and Intoxicating. It definitley pulled me more into the series and am looking forward for the rest of the story! Never forget Carrie Fisher","true":true}
