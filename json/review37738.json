Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was no plot. The entire movie was one chase scene. The video game side quest had no depth and took way too long. There were so many inconsistencies that it was distracting. TFA is made worse with the addition of this film because the few interesting questions that movie raised\\, this movie threw in the garbage. The few answers they bothered to give were awful. I hope you didn't like a lot of the main characters of TFA\\, because they're made to look like idiots in this. It looked nice except when it looked like a TV movie. Lastly\\, two things: 1. Why wasn't a single pilot wearing goggles as they were flying through salt clouds? and 2. Lando would've answered that call.","true":true}
