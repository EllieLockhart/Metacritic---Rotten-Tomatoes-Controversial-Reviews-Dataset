Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't get me wrong\\, this is a good movie\\, but there are two scenes missing from the movie.  I haven't seen the deleted scenes yet so they may be in there\\, but these scenes are needed:\\n\\nFirst\\, I believe Kathleen Kennedy (who I love and think is doing a great job with the franchise) asked why isn't Leia using the Force.  It's no surprise that she could use the Force because she seems to be Force sensitive.  Because her use of the Force to save herself was so alarming (she goes from no Force use to what seems like Master Force use)\\, there should have been a scene where Leia uses the Force before she was blasted into space.  Perhaps a scene where she is floating an object in her hand (perhaps a pair of dice) while nobody is watching.  Someone could walk up\\, not notice what she is doing\\, and she stops and we've established she can use the Force before being stunned that she can.  \\n\\nSecond\\, there should have been more scenes at the end of the movie showing that the purpose of Luke doing what he did was so he could provide Hope to the galaxy.  Frankly\\, I was confused here.  I couldn't understand what the purpose of Luke's sacrifice was and\\, as a director\\, I think the last thing you want your audience to be is confused.  So\\, perhaps a quick montage of scenes across the galaxy where the story of Luke's sacrifice is being told instead of just the one with the kids.  That way\\, you can establish that Hope is spreading.  I just didn't get that there was Hope from the one scene unless the slave kids are going to rise up themselves in the next movie and create a Rebellion.  Any way\\, I left confused as to why Luke did what he did.  I understand he was trying to spread Hope\\, but the mark was missed here.  \\n\\nAnyway\\, good movie.  Well done\\, but the message trying to get across was missed in a couple of places.","true":true}
