{"101487":136248,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made this account to add my 2 cents on this film\\, and the direction it has put star wars in.  At this point we all know Solo tanked at the box office because of the failure that was Episode VIII.  Rian Johnson has at least mortally wounded star wars\\, it was already in poor health due to the prequels\\, and Rian nearly killed this franchise\\, my favorite franchise.  Disney's many employees have called the true fans many names\\, labeled us overweight white males\\, racists\\, sexists\\, russian bots\\, you name it\\, but we're just fans\\, watching star wars die\\, like Obi-Wan watching as Qui Gon is slain in front of him\\, unable to do anything.  But all we ask is that these movies be made of quality\\, without ruining the characters like they brutally ruined LUKE SKYWALKER\\, the main original character that we've known and loved for 4 decades.  All we want is care put into a vision the fits with the original trilogy\\, that continued that\\, that respected the lore of this amazing universe\\, the rules that apply to it\\, and the general feel of it\\, the creativity of it.  The worst part is that Carrie is gone.  This trilogy was the last chance to get the 3 main original characters back together\\, but instead they killed Han Solo in the first one\\, then they go and kill Luke Skywalker but he commits suicide via astral projection...I don't even.....I just......I've had this conversation so many times\\, seen too many dozens of videos of people pointing out the exact same obvious and major flaws within the movie\\, in literally every scene...I'm not going to sit here and type 50 pages about it all\\, most of you know all of this already.  What is important is that everyone knows that your money is your vote!  I didn't see this movie until it was dumped onto Netflix like some broken\\, unwanted thing\\, I never gave it a penny\\, nor did I go to see Solo.  I almost walked out of the theater during Force Awakens because of Rey just automatically being able to resist and then reverse sith interrogation techniques\\, learning the jedi mind trick\\, and learning how to command the force well enough to grab a lightsaber while a trained force user is already retrieving it the same way\\, among many other stupid and wrong things in the film\\, but The Last Jedi is (and I say this as a hardcore\\, knowledgeable fan) the WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER MADE.  The 3rd film can only be garbage at this point.  Don't waste your money\\, they'll throw it on Netflix like they did with this film (only episodic star wars movie to be thrown on Netflix for a reason) and Rogue One (not a terrible movie actually) and Solo (utter garbage and only star wars film in HISTORY to lose money).  Star wars is on life support\\, but Disney is thriving as always.  They don't care about this franchise\\, they will milk it and dump it's carcass\\, then just continue to make money off their new star wars theme park\\, and find other ways to ride of the tail of the original trilogy.  Boycott Disney's star wars until it is in better hands\\, whether they sell off the rights or fire Kathleen Kennedy and don't allow Rian Johnson anywhere near any and all star wars productions.  Boycott this garbage trilogy\\, don't buy the tickets\\, don't buy the DVDs or the Blurays\\, the toy sales are already way down so go ahead and get yaself some star wars legos if ya really want.  These movies don't produce good toys though\\, which is why the sales are way down.","true":true}
