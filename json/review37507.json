Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are things I really dislike about this movie\\, and there are things I really like about this movie. Knowing what happened to Carrie Fisher I wish they would have done some cgi magic and had her be the hero that piloted the ship into the star destroyer. That would have been a great end for a beautiful person and character. Holdo's character was an unknown\\, thinly developed\\, and annoying. She keeps her people in the dark about what the plan is. Later after the Poe mutiny she says she really likes the guy. Wtf?\\n\\nI am an old school Star Wars fan that grew up with the originals. I don't like the idea that Luke would raise a saber to a student\\, and his nephew no less\\, however it does make for a great story arc for Kylo Ren's character. I really liked the interaction and development of both Kylo and Rey. I was also really impressed by Hamill's portrayal of the old surly Luke. He nailed it\\, and it was a good end for Luke. Overall\\, I went into the movie knowing that this is in a Disney Star Wars universe so I enjoyed it okay.","true":true}
