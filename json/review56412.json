Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The amount of people freaking out about this film is ridiculous. I have to seriously question the attachment some of you have over a story. \\n\\nThere are some things I didn't like about the moving (mutinous wild goose chase subplot that leads to the decimation of the resistance ugh). \\n\\nBut there are some objections that are absurd. You didn't like Rey's revealed heritage because it didn't fit your fan theories? Appreciate that it was unexpected\\, and cling to the hope that it will prove not true in the sequel (I for one thought it was a good move for various reasons). \\n\\nYou are upset how Luke turned out? He was never a full Jedi Master  because his training was never completed (and he started late anyway) and I'm not surprised that a weak moment that caused him to be responsible for his nephew's turn to the dark side would throw him. Besides\\, he's not the hero of this story guys\\, it's a new saga. \\n\\nAll the butt-hurt about Snoke dying? Good Lord! He was always a minor character who's role was his investment in Kylo. People who wasted time imagining a back story for him only to be disappointed have completely missed the focus of this movie which was the relationship between Rey & Kylo. I for one am excited to see where things go with the next installment.","true":true}
