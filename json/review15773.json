{"101487":135868,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love EVERYTHING Star Wars from the originals\\, the books\\, video games\\, cartoons\\, prequels(to a lesser extent)\\, and even TFA whilst acknowledging that it was just a reboot.  Rogue One was probably my 3rd fave behind ANH and ESB.  Last Jedi was the first Star Wars movie I have ever watched and NOT wanted to go see it again straight away. I was extremely underwhelmed with a movie that felt like they were trying Guardians of the Galaxy humor to reach this Marvel universe generation.(Love Marvel btw\\, for being Marvel\\, Not Star Wars) Poe was basically made into Star Lord from Guardians and Hux was just the butt of jokes.  Luke was relegated to being Jack Sparrow.(Replace him with Johnny Depp tossing the lightsaber\\, swinging across the pole\\, and milking that sea creature and you will get it).  I can see why Mark Hamill was bitter about the direction DIsney and Rian Johnson took with his character. The Leia in space bit felt so forced(pun intended) and was basically just Mary Poppins. The Canto Bight scene felt like it should be in a year 2087 James Bond movie and not in a galaxy far\\, far away. That whole subplot was pointless and makes you go\\, \\\"well if finn and rose can go hyperspace and make it back\\, why can't the first order just do that too)Wasted characters like Snoke and Phasma who we never got to learn more of. I mean really\\, Snoke has amassed this giant army and fleet\\, has strong dark side powers and he just gets wasted. The broom kid at the end felt like it was a commercial for a Disneyland ride or the new Disney Star Wars hotel. Benicio Del Toro's character had a lot of promise and probably one of the only bits I had interest in. Laura Dern is a fantastic actor who was wasted and looked more like she should be in Hunger Games. The part of her taking the cruiser into light speed to destroy the super Snoke destroyer was a good bit though. However\\, it would have served fanboys to have Ackbar pilot the cruiser and save Ms Dern for a more senior role in E9. I could go on and on but I am just getting more frustrated with how bad it was. I've never questioned whether or not I would watch the next episode or not.  Deconstructing this horrible mess of a movie has made me lean towards not.","true":true}
