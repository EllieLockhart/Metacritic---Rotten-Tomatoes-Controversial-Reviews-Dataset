Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it!! Very exciting\\, wonderfully acted\\, and beautifully shot. Days later I'm still enjoying taking apart the symbolism and thinking about the themes. Everybody fails\\, but it's important what you do NEXT! Look deeper at what's hiding under the surface. The old ways are broken\\, so let's build anew. <3 Luke is the sassiest and it's amazing.","true":true}
