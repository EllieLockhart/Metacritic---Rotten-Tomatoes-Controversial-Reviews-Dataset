Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"lol the whole time they could have just taken a small ship and jump it to light speed and crash it into a planet. 8 movies? about death stars and they never thought to do that. Acting is lower than Youtube quality\\, critics are bad at their jobs.","true":true}
