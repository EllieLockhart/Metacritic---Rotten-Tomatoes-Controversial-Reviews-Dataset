Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is now the 2nd time I've seen Star Wars: Episode 8 - The Last Jedi and I can say that it wasn't as bad as I remembered. \\n\\nStar Wars: Episode 8 - The Last Jedi is the 9th Star Wars film to be released in cinemas and is the 8th film in the series. The film was directed by Rian Johnson\\, who also directed Looper. The film stars Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nThe acting in my opinion wasn't bad\\, but at points the acting felt very off. I also felt that a lot of the actors didn't really fit their characters. \\n\\nThe characters I personally hate from Kylo Ren to Rose Tico. The characters in my opinion are annoying\\, boring\\, and even uninteresting. Even Luke Skywalker's character was annoying and betrayed. \\n\\nThe cinematography in my opinion was strong with some very good shots of the characters and scenery.\\n\\nThe settings were okay\\, but I felt that they were either rehashes from earlier films in the serise or were just there to make the runtime of the film hit the 2.30h mark.\\n\\nThe set designs\\, costume designs\\, and makeup were all done very well from the structure designs to the various weapons and machines.\\n\\nThe practical and special effects for the most part were very strong\\, but there were points within the film were some of the CGI either felt out of place or just looked plain stupid.\\n\\nThe action was steady from the direction to the cinematography\\, but a lot of the time the action scenes either felt lacking or just dragged on.\\n\\nThe music in my opinion was probably the greatest aspect of the film\\, but then again a lot of it takes from the original soundtrack.\\n\\nPersonally I didn't find the story compelling or enjoyable\\, but that could be because of my hate for the characters. \\n\\nThe comedy in my opinion could be one of the worst aspects of the film from the jokes at the expense of the originals trilogy to the really irritating comedic relief characters.\\n\\nThe film also had some strong atmosphere\\, but it constantly kept getting ruined by the sheer stupidity of some of the scenes.  \\n\\nI also want to point out that I have loads of complaints with the film from the timing mistakes to the cool ideas put to wast. The film in my opinion makes some really stupid decisions that ruin the experience of the film. One decision I really hated was the character change they gave to Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nThe film I also found boring and really uninteresting. \\n\\nOver all I give it a\\n3\/10\\n30%\\n1.5\/5\\n\\nYou may like the film\\, but I personally do not","true":true}
