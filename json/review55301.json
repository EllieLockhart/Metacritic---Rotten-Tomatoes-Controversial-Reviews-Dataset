Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Longtime fan\\, love all things Star Wars. That said\\, this movies story was utter trash. You could have just cut out the second act and made this movie way better. I mean it picks up literally right after TFA and the draw (which is horribly written) states the entire Rebublic has fallen to the First Order! WTF how? I miss the political intrigue of the prequels. \\n\\nThe visuals of this movie are stunning\\, I will give it that. However\\, we all know that visuals alone don't make a movie that we return to time and time again. Story is everything. Mark Hammels performance is really one of the redeeming performances of the film. I don't agree with he direction Disney too Luke\\, but Mark really should be at least nominated for best supporting actor. Kylo Ren's character was also interesting if a little predictable and cliche. \\n\\nI would say save your money and rent it when it comes out.","true":true}
