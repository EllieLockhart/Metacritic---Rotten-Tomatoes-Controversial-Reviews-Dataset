Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Jedi manages to emphasize boring new characters with minimal story arcs and diminish the heavyweight characters to bit parts. Important assets in previous films are tossed aside. Important questions raised in TFA are not only not answered\\, they are unimportant. It is a good thing this movie takes place in space because there is zero gravity to the story.","true":true}
