Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story stumbles along for three hours\\, and doesn\u2019t expand its universe or characters in any way they feels meaningful. It has a few flashes of brilliance\\, that are quickly snuffed out by poor attempts at comic relief\\, or eye rolling conveniences.","true":true}
