Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was twelve when I saw the phantom mennace. I'd watched 4 5 and 6 already but was blown away with child like wonderment at episode one's sprawling new galaxy filled with awesome jedi. I got to feel that again so many years later with the last jedi.","true":true}
