Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie with unexpected plot twists and new jedi tricks never before seen. Before you rate this movie think of all the movies that get high ratings. This movie is worthy of a 4-5 star range. Giving this movie 3 stars or below means you think you should have skipped it. Any true Star Wars fan would never give it such a low rating. Don't follow the crowd...think for yourself before you rate it.","true":true}
