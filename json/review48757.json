Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I've seen in theaters. I'm not going to waste my time explaining how terrible the movie was. The way they treated Luke was terrible. If he saw the good in Vader how couldn't he see the conflict in his own nephew? The humor was terrible. I'm not even going to get into the sjw crap they were trying to pull. All I'm going to say is to keep that bs out of Star Wars. The fight scenes made no sense at all and that Leia scene was terrible. It was just a horrible movie that was essentially just a money grabber because that's all the people care about. I guess the force connection scene between Rey and Jylo was pretty cool and the cgi was the best it's ever been but that's about it. This is just a disgrace to the Star Wars saga as a whole and they should honestly redo this movie","true":true}
