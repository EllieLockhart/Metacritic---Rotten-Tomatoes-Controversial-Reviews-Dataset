Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A hideous steaming pile of you-know-what. Rian Johnson nearly destroyed the legacy of star wars. It was so sloppy and poorly conceived\\, I am beside myself with disappointment and bewilderment at the critical acclaim this terrible movie received. I wil likely boycott Johnson from now on for his reckless destruction of a rich set of stories spanning 4 decades. His attempts to \\\"subvert expectations\\\" are neither clever nor well crafted.","true":true}
