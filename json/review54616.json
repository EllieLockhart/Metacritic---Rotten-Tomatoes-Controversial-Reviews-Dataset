Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m upset . Episode 8 totally sucked . They are forcing these new characters down your throat !! They just push the characters we fell in love with aside and kill them off like they are meaningless. These new characters are uncharismatic and difficult to fall in love with. This damaged the series as far as I\u2019m concerned . Thank goodness for the classics !!! These new episodes are just a knock off of the old story line only worse. The only relevant difference is that they were able to do much more for the legacy of Star Wars in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s with soooo much less technology !","true":true}
