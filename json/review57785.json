Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but the dialogue can be downright childish\\, at times\\, and\\, alot of the action\/battle scenes\\, as has been typical of the franchise\\, also seem to be conceived by a focus grp of 3rd graders.  Not only does \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" require u to check your disbelief at the dr\\, but\\, it rips it from your hands\\, whilst you're still deciding what to wear to the theater!  If u have a military\/ tactical mind\\, you're gonna be bombarded w\/silly scenes\\, whereby some hairbrained scheme\\, that ignores the laws of physics\\, and the weaponry\/technology involved\\, or relies upon some oddly-specific vehicles\\, which\\, simply would not've been procured\\, given the limited resources of the rebellion\\, and the fact that other craft could perform this mission\\, and many others!  But WHY?  We \\nare incredulous\\, and feel as though we're hemorrhaging IQ points\\, merely by being exposed to this childish dribble\\, but\\, would the kids be similarly outraged\\, if the storyline were abit more \\\"realistic\\\"?   I think it's time to for the gown-up Star Wars to divest itself of the \\\"shackles of pointless stupidity\\\"\\, and try to make sense.","true":true}
