Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was bad. Some really unbelievable things happen and maybe the editing department got lazy but more than one person is exposed to space with no force field separating them from the vacuum of space.","true":true}
