Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was terrible. The set up made from 7 were over looked and thrown away. Character development was disgusting\\, and new ones are added left and right. The story liine is beond confusing\\, and everything that happenes during the whole movie all most means nothing. The movie\\, had it not been for the success of all the others\\, would have been given a 1\/5 simply for the music. Just terrible.","true":true}
