Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I saw it\\, it kinda pissed me off.  But I could tell that it was well written\\, directed and acted....it was just the character development going in a different direction than I wanted that irked me.  But on a second viewing\\, and some reflection\\, I've drawn my own conclusion that this is one of the greatest Star Wars movies ever made.   In fact\\, I doubt they will ever make a Star Wars movie this good ever again\\, because it was such a good film that it challenged people's preconceived notions.  It wasn't a \\\"safe\\\" film.   It was a amazing and challenging film.  Disney probably will force future installments to pander to the narrow minded fanbase that can't let go.","true":true}
