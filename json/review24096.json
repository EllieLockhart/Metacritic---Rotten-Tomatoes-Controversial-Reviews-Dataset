Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive star wars fan and it's the only movie I go to the cinema for. It was a bad movie\\, but worse still it was a terrible star wars fans movie. \\nFirstly it was obviously diverse for the sake of being so. I'm surprised there wasn't an lgbt alien. I only make this point because I noticed it and if you read the wired review they give it 5 stars simply because it is. \\nLuke is wasted. Leia is dull. Kylo ren almost impossibly weaker than before. The acting is corny. The last fighter with the last bomb with the last drop of fuel with the last heart beat\\, everytime ... Oh please. \\nApparently all you have to do to outrun an imperial fleet... Is go fast and they can't catch you.  And if you want to take out all of the cannons on a destroyer surrounded by an imperial fleet is send one xwing and they can't do anything about it.","true":true}
