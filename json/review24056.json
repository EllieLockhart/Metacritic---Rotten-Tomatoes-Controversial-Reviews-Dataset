Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Marvel Movies in a galaxy far far away... it was worst than attack of the clone\\, at least that one had revolutionnary cgi for his time.","true":true}
