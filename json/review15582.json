Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the force awakens\\, I was really disappointed by this flick. There was so much more that could've been done with this movie I feel. Saw Too little of Snoke and Luke.  We could have been given a little something of Snoke and Reys' backstory.  It was teased and then never saw fruition.  The whole trip to the casino planet seemed like a waste of time. We could've seen more of Luke or Rey doing something meaningful.  What about Finns'  backstory?  We know nothing of him!   Luke would have never have attacked a young Ben\\, and would have definitely left his planet. There was a lot missing from Leah's  character as well. She obviously had some kind of training\\, but there was no mention of this at all. Rose was Underdeveloped and unneeded. What About Laura Derns' Character? Didn't like her character either. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they were women! Captain  Phasma was awesome\\, but again\\, no character development and overwhelmingly unused.  I see a trend of pushing Feminism and Staying away from the tried and true Star Wars formula","true":true}
