Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why so many people dislike Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi. People disliked the Force Awakens because it was too similar to the original Star Wars and now we get an original Star Wars film\\, and people complain that it is too different. It was a great film.
