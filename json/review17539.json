Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to give this movie a rating.  I am a fan of the originals\\, what the %$#.  This movie is so bad.  did not make sense\\, there was no story.  Ridiculous\\, what did they do to Star Wars.  What did they do to Luke !!!  BUL##&#.  I can't believe the critics have the rating so high. This is horrible.","true":true}
