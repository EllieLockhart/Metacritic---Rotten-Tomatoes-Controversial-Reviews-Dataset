Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, I don't know where to start. Okay I know\\, Rian Johnson basically said the hell with The Force Awakens. The plot and story is terrible\\, the characters with maybe the exception of Kylo are terrible\\, the Rose side story was garbage\\, Luke being a whiny b**** was a joke. How do you do that to a Skywalker? His heading should have been a glorious one. This is 40 years in the making and he goes out like a chump? Daisy Ridley phoned this one in. She said she doesn't want to do this much longer and it showed. Purple hair lady....do I need to explain? Admiral Akbar got treated to a crap ending. Leia in space? Enough said there. I wasn't a big fan of TFA but it was a beginning. I'm not sure JJ can save this. I have no hope for future Star Wars installments. Ron Howard doing the Solo movie? Rian Johnson doing another trilogy? Do yourself a favor and watch Star Wars Rebels and The Clone Wars. They are way better than this trash movie.","true":true}
