Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waste of time. Wish I had not wasted money on this. The movie made no sense. Nothing happened. There were no losses or gains or any sort of reason behind the movie. The biggest loss was a rebel ship. What a joke.","true":true}
