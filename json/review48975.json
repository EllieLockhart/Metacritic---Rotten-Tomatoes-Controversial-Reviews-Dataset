Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. Don't listen to the \\\"professional critics\\\"\\, they are liars and panderers. Looking for points so Disney can treat them right and get invited to premieres. The BEST reviews come from people who have nothing financial to gain from giving a film a good review.","true":true}
