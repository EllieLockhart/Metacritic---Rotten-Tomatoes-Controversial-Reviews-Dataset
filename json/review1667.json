Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it was very enjoyable. As a Star Wars movie\\, WTH?! I completely understand wanting to open up the franchise to new possible directions\\, but this was a terrible way to do it. Star Wars is still a phenomenon today BECAUSE OF its original storyline and characters. This movie attempts to tear that down in order to move in a different direction rather than build from it to do the same thing. Disney\\, why build a whole new theme park based on what we love\\, if you\u2019re just burning down what we love in order to move in a new direction?","true":true}
