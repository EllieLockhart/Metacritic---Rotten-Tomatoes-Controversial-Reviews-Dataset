Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After TFA - which I liked but essentially was A new hope 2.0 - the second installment of this trilogy dared to show us something new\\, which may not please every fan\\, but originality (I think) is something to be appreciated. Personally I loved it and can't wait for the next movie :)","true":true}
