Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love everything star wars... from the film's to the comics. But this.. this was a pile of Wampa shit. From Snoke to Phasma and to Luke.... Just WOW.  They could of done so much more. Super disappointed. \\n\\n\\n\\n I don't write reviews but I will in  hope to change the future.\\nAnd stop with the forced humor GEEZ","true":true}
