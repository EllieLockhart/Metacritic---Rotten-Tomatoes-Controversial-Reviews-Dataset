Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very different than any Star Wars movie before it. If you go in with an open mind you'll see that while not perfect (the middle gets a little slow) the overall movie is amazing and well worth multiple viewings.","true":true}
