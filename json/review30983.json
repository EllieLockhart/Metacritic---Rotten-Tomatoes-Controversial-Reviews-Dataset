Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing! It really upsets me the complete disregard to the legend that Luke Skywalker was. So many plot holes\\, it almost seems like the writers forgot to watch the Force Awakens or even the prequels and the originals. Getting rid of our beloved characters in meaningless ways. Just ruined the trilogy completely. Beautiful cinematography but story SUCKS! I will never watch this piece of crap again! ","true":true}
