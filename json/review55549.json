Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NON SPOILER REVIEW. - Well\\, there is no doubt\\, I haven't enjoyed a Star Wars film as much\\, since my favorite: Return of the Jedi. This movie is something completely new\\, bold\\, risky while holding on to familiar themes and ultimately\\, infinitely more rewarding then the Force Awakens was. I am tired of watching perfectly crafted blockbusters that on the surface deliver all you expected\\, or shamelessly play on nostalgia. It's a feeling of being spoon-fed while you are drooling like a mindless zombie. \\n\\nThe last Jedi is a work of cinematic art that I find is nearly extinct within the hero genre these days. All the leads and supporting characters deliver emotionally fulfilling performances. But I must say watching Carrie Fisher\\, as well as Mark\\, was heartwarming and kind of sad at the same time. I have never seen better from them. \\n\\nCarrie\\, I hope you are watching this with a smirk and heaving grand old time wherever you are!??\\n\\nRian Johnson made a masterpiece.\\nIt delivers an experience you didn't know you wanted instead of what's needed. It isn't perfect because it tears you up\\, it challenges your expectations\\, it questions assumptions\\, it makes you wait\\, but finally... It puts it all back together in a powerful display of deep feeling of love for this franchise and its archetypal meaning.","true":true}
