Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never in my life I left a review for a movie\\, but this one is so disrespectful to all episodes in the history that I have to comment on this movie. I grew up with the movies back in the 80's and know every storyline by heart. \\n\\nWhat I have seen now makes me very very sad  It manages to make all previous parts and saga of the force into a ridiculous believe (instead of adding a little bit of humor to the story).\\n\\nFurthermore I have never ever heard a political correct statement (casino\\, guns scene Benicio del Toro) in a Star Wars movie ! This is ridiculous and should never be allowed. And then I can write 2 more books about everything that is wrong about this movie. From the technical point of views as in the story line. A whole movie about chasing another ship ?? Really the most worse story you can come up with  \\n\\nI've waited two years for this movie.......you can even say 25 years after the return of the Jedi. I was so relieved to see the good start with the force awakens.......and now this crappy bad quality sequel. It made me really sad.\\n\\nI think its save the say this was my last movie after 30 years........Disrespectful bad","true":true}
