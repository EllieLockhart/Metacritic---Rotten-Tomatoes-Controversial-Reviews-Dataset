Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The music in the film is phenomenal\\, and there a a few moments with speculator effects\\, primarily involving a space battle\\, other than this I have nothing positive to say about this film. The scenes are acted well for the most part but the scrip and plot are very week. The protagonist seems extremely powerful and important yet there seems to be no reason why. She meets one of the greatest characters in film history and he doesn't train her...she is already powerful and his actions make him unrecognizable to the hero we once new. This is the longest Star Wars movie AND has the least content\\, not much actually happened in this film yet...all the best characters are dead. By itself this is a bad film\\, being a Star Wars films\\, I would say it's the worse yet. I'd rather watch Battle for Endor.
