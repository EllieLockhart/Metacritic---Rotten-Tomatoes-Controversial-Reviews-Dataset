Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the newest edition in the Star Wars franchise\\, I had to take a couple of days to let the first impressions soak in and listen to my friends' and colleagues' thoughts before I dove into reviewing \\\"Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi.\\\" I came to the conclusion that I felt bad for writer\/director of \\\"The Last Jedi\\,\\\" Rian Johnson\\, who has shown his masterful direction in \\\"Looper\\\" and Breaking Bad's best episode \\\"Ozymandias.\\\" Johnson was basically given the power to write and direct \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" with no storyline to help him push the film towards the ninth installment of the series. It definitely shows in \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\" While \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is not a bad movie\\, it is a poorly executed film due to a messy storyline and some confusing scenes.\\n\\n\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" takes place where \\\"Episode VII: The Force Awakens\\\" left off. The Rebels are trying to survive the onslaught from Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)\\, Supreme Emperor Snoak and the First Order while Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks training from Master Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)\\, who has been in hiding for years. Luke\\, who has turned his back on the force after Kylo Ren (then Ben Solo) turned to the dark side\\, has become a grumpy Obi Wan. After some pleas\\, Luke agrees to train Rey in the ways of the force\\, similar to the instances in \\\"Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\\,\\\" though not as memorable. When the film is not focused on Rey and Luke\\, it changes back to the Rebels fleeing from the First Order\\, who have the ability to track ships using hyper-speed.\\n\\n\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" truly shines between the two lead characters: Kylo Ren and Rey. Both characters believe they see something within the other and will join forces to tackle a common enemy. Kylo Ren\\, who now has the scar of a lightsaber burn from the hands of Rey in \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" believes Snoak is losing faith in him and wants to show that he has walked away from the light. On the other hand Rey\\, who is beginning to realize how powerful she is\\, is looking for some answers about her past and her connection to the force. Without going into full spoilers\\, at some point these two characters are able to interact with one another by using the force. It is through these fantastic sequences that the characters begin to realize the strengths and weaknesses in one another as well as what the future might entail for both of them. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" also shines through its portrayal of Luke Skywalker. While some may disagree\\, I found Luke to be one of the best parts of the movie. Both funny and serious\\, Mark Hamill's performance as Luke was very well done...even though the actor has come about a few times regarding his opinions on how Luke is portrayed in the film.\\n\\nWhere the film falters is within the poorly executed material throughout the entire film. As you may know (and with a 51% approval rating from the audience on Rotten Tomatoes)\\, the film has not sat well with most audiences. Without going into spoilers\\, this is because of some drastic and surprising twists that no one saw coming. I refer back to Rian Johnson\\, who was both the writer and director for the film. Johnson was put into an interesting predicament: while he was given full creativity\\, Johnson was not given a layout on how Episodes VII-IX were supposed to go. This is due to the fact that there was no plan put in place prior to the development of \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\" Therefore\\, Johnson came in with no plan and was told to make a Star Wars film...and what we got was \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\" The film basically took the basic layout of characters and storyline from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and shook it up\\, leaving fans - who created their own predictions and theories on certain characters and the storyline in general - to feel cheated. There is some merit to this point however. While this review will remain spoiler-free\\, as a movie goer who likes Star Wars (but does not characterize himself as a Star Wars fan\/fanatic)\\, I too felt confused and cheated when leaving the movie theater.\\n\\nOn paper\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" works. I can see the vision of Rian Johnson's story and love it. However\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" that has been released lacks the execution needed to make it one of the best Star Wars films to date. While the film is supported by its two leads\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" falters from an uneven script from a masterful director who was not given a layout of how the series was supposed to go. In the end\\, we were given a messy\\, confusing story that - unfortunately - leaves most of us not begging for more.\\n\\nGrade: C-","true":true}
