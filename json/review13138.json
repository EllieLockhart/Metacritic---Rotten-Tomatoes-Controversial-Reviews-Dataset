Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know why fans are bashing this film. Honestly it had such an amazing plot with a few quirks but the twists which thre all the fan theories out the window made up for it. I've been a fan of the original trilogy and watched since then and this has to be the best Star Wars sequel I've seen since Empire and it's clearly better than anything the prequel trilogy did","true":true}
