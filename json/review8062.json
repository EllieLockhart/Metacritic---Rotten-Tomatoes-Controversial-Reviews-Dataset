Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic and beautiful film! While the overall feel of the dialogue and characterization felt more modern\\, the action and heart of the film remained true to the feel of the original trilogy once again. The more modern dialogue and character-interaction moments made a it clear that we are dealing with a new generation of heroes\\, though their hearts are still the same as the originals we fell in love with. This is a generation bridging film that brings together much loved characters from the past as well as instant classic characters of the present. The new creatures introduced were fantastically animated and designed and the landscapes (both digitally crafted and live-shot) were breathtaking. People who are upset that this movie doesn't follow their strict ideas of how a Star Wars film should be done are clearly too dull and caught up with a idolized fan-made image of perfection to really value the masterpiece that this movie is. A fantastic follow up to The Force Awakens which leaves you eager for the final installment.","true":true}
