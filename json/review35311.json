Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The highs are some of the best\\, the lows are with episode 1-3. I got to a point in the movie where I was almost going to put this with episode 1-3. Luke milking alien\\, the casino scene\\, And Leia flying topped this. HOWEVER\\, the final 20 minutes\\, with Lukes scene with Kylo Ren\\, and his Binary sunset scene was up with the best scenes in all of star wars. I liked Rogue one as a movie more\\, but the highs in this one were some of the best. ","true":true}
