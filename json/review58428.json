Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great film especially with repeated views. Clever and well thought out on so many levels. Rian Johnson has moved the Star Wars universe on and provided surprises along the way. Gone are the predictable boss level set pieces; replaced with a fresh look at the Force and how it permeates everything in the Star Wars universe. Some questions are answered\\, but there\u2019s much to mull over until episode 9. Looking forward to to the Blu-ray and the reported masses of full scenes which were not added to the final cut. I don\u2019t understand the negative comments and placing it as the worst Star Wars film behind the prequels is inconceivable. Although I can see people\u2019s opinion changing when Ep9 comes out and the story is complete.","true":true}
