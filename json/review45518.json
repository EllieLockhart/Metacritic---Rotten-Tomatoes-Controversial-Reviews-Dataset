Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed. Was it so hard to write an original story without totally destroying the legacy of the most important Star Wars character of all time. The movie made the search for Luke and Rey's journey in the Force Awakes irrelevant. 34 for years to see Luke milk and Alien. The story was an insult to the character and to Mark Hamill. Surely a more dignified story could have been written. 334 year wait to see Luke milk an Alien. Id would of preferred a Green light saber. Worse Star Wars movie in the trilogy.","true":true}
