Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was great--Mark Hamill nailed it--and there were many scenes that were fun to watch\\, but I felt the ending was a failure on so many fronts that it magnified errors I may have otherwise overlooked. The humor felt shoehorned in for the most part\\, the porgs were merely glorified Disney ATMs\\, and the regression that was Finn and Rose's middle act--with its heavy-handed\\, too-short-to-be-poignant social commentary--felt excessive and ultimately pointless. Series consistency meant little to Johnson: things seemed to happen just because the writer-god deemed it so\\, and that may have been one of the more annoying aspects of the film. There's so much more to say\\, and most of it bad\\, but none of the rest is spoiler free. In my opinion\\, it seems like how much someone will enjoy this film depends on how much they can overlook.","true":true}
