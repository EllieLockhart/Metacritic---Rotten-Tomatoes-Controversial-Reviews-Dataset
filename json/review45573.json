Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. It's a film which is fairly well made\\, certainly beautiful to look at\\, and with some superb acting. There are some issues with tone\\, and has extremely major problems with the plot\\, but all that taken into account\\, if it was a new IP\\, it would be all-in-all... pretty good. However\\, this takes place in the 'Star Wars Universe'\\, and there are in-universe rules that should be followed... after all this is science fiction\\, not a superhero film. And that is where the film falls down. The film straight up craps on all the Star Wars lore and the character's we know and love. It's utterly appalling. The best bit of this film is Mark Hamill's performance\\, which was superb\\, especially considering he (as I found out later) is also on the record as agreeing with the criticisms the fans are making of the film.","true":true}
