Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fantastic movie that grapples with the implications behind the ideologies and moral questions of the Star Wars universe in a way that I found very compelling. Granted\\, it does not have the world-building charm of many of the other movies\\, but from a narrative- and character-centered perspective I thought it was a wonderful film\\, that at turns challenged and reconfirmed the spirit of preceding Star Wars films.","true":true}
