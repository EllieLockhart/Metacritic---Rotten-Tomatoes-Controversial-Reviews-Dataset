Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, I was very careful in my wording here. The best way to put it is Force Awakens felt like a remake\\, but it was a good remake and it left us with a lot of fun questions and speculations. The Last Jedi ruined much of what Force Awakens set up in a way that felt insulting to me. Added to that\\, the movie used far too much cheap humor at the expense of what could have been meaningful scenes. Finally\\, I hate when films rely on deus ex machina to solve problems\\, but since its a fantasy it can be expected. However\\, this movie used it very liberally and in ways that I couldn't justify. I felt embarrassed and kept having to cover my face and shake my head. I have never been so disappointed by something I was so excited about.","true":true}
