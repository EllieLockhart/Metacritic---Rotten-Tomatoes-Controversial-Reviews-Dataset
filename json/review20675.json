{"101487":146119,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've waited a long time to write this review and probably do not have anything to say that has not already been said. I'm terribly disappointed in this movie and in the critical response to it. Critics look at films for such things as relevance\\, plot\\, structure. We study critical theory and look closer at a film than the general audience\\, priding ourselves for understanding such things as narrative and context. Critics look at every scene for often ridiculous pieces of evidence to apply to ambiguous theories and this is why critics are so often out of touch with what an audience enjoys. When people are enjoying a great story\\, critics are delving into the subtext and looking for inapplicable symbols to express their theory; whether its an insane focus on phallic and yonic symbolism or Freudian stretches to an Oedipal complex\\, or forcing the characters into a Marxist clash that doesn't exist in the script. Then you have a trainwreck of a film like this which audiences are immediately turned off to and somehow critics jump to the other side and praise the film for all of its worst attributes. Suddenly narrative does not matter. That the majority of the film was wasted on a subplot that made no sense somehow escapes the notice of critics. Those of us who criticize the film are lambasted as disillusioned \\\"fan boys\\\" or heckled for wishing the film was just like Empire. This is nonsense. This whole film was nonsense but what is particularly upsetting about it was its missed potential. Johnson introduced a number of compelling ideas\\, gave us a taste of them\\, had us lean in for a second\\, and then snatched it away for no reason at all. People say that the fans who disliked the film are holding on to the Skywalker legacy or some other nostalgia\\, but that's not true. I wanted new Star Wars. Nothing would have made me happier than having something new and exciting\\, but that's not what this film did. It kept making itself look like it was going to do that and then just pulled away and killed itself...every chance it got. There is no way that anyone watching this film can make sense of it because if there is a theme to this movie\\, it is that nothing matters. Nothing that happened before matters\\, and everything will just work itself out in the end so nothing that happens now matters\\, either. SPOILERS AHEAD: This film builds on J.J. Abrams' Episode VII which\\, while there were some issues with the film\\, was in retrospect a fairly solid platform for this trilogy to build upon. Abrams introduced some very compelling characters and integrated the familiar faces from the original franchise very well. There were some plot holes and a few inconsistencies and errors of logic (such as Han looking up at the sky and seeing the republic capitol planets exploding when he should not have been able to) but some of these are to be expected in Star Wars. The original films are full of logical fallacies that we can easily ignore. Johnson\\, however\\, took logical inconsistency to a whole new place. One very large problem that maybe other people aren't bothered with\\, are the issues with time. Previous films have also taken some liberty with the concept of time. Empire has Luke running to Dagobah and spending what seems to be months in training with Yoda in the same time that Han and Leia are spending a few hours running from Vader's fleet (which can be accounted for with the amount of time it might have taken them at sublight speed to reach Bespin). Episode II had Yoda assemble and transport an entire army of clone troopers from the outer rim to Geonosis in the couple of hours that Anakin and Obi-wan were held captive. The fleet in Rogue One manages to respond nearly instantly to an air strike call and the large battle at the end of the film despite that the supported characters were several hours ahead of them. In Episode 8\\, however\\, we're made to believe that a fleeing capitol ship containing the remnants of the resistance is given 16 hours worth of fuel (worst ticking clock device ever)\\, and in that time\\, much of which is already consumed by Finn's recovery and attempted escape\\, Finn and Rose are able to flee the ship (which also made no sense with the device of the ship moving too fast for fighters to be able to attack it)\\, jump to another star system\\, search a casino city\\, get arrested\\, spend a night in a jail cell\\, flee from the police\\, be \\\"rescued\\\" by another person\\, and get back to the place where the resistance is being pursued. This is a minor problem when you consider that nothing they did on that planet made any sense or had any real purpose. They had to find \\\"code breaker\\\" (spend two weeks coming up with that name\\, Disney?\\\"\\, but they get arrested instead...but that's okay\\, we don't need code breaker anyway. He was the only person who could sneak them onto a star destroyer\\, but doesn't matter because there's another person in the jail cell with them who can do the same thing that he was the only possible person to do. Rey needs a teacher\\, but Luke won't do it...but that's okay\\, because she doesn't really need a teacher anyway. But then Yoda tells Luke that they can't lose Rey\\, so Luke does absolutely nothing to help her anyway. Luke dies\\, leaving no one to train Rey\\, but that's okay because the books that Yoda burned somehow made it onto the Falcon. The resistance is trapped in cave with only one way out and they lose the fight\\, but that's okay because there's another way out of the back that didn't exist before. Then you have Finn doing the one thing that gave his character real meaning. A decision that Finn made to put his fear aside to be the real hero and he commits himself and it's real and it's meaningful\\, but then Rose crashes into him and prevents it. And then somehow they make it from the middle of the plain surrounded by imperials with both of their vehicles completely destroyed\\, but somehow they beat the First Order back to the base and manage to escape with everyone else. Everything that was compelling and moving in this film was wasted with LAZY\\, LAZY\\, LAZY points of convenience. You can't throw that many \\\"coincidences\\\" into a film and expect anyone to find it meaningful. Everything that happened in this film cheapened the characters and their choices because nothing matters... some convenient coincidence will always be there to save the day. This is a mere fraction of the problems with this film.","true":true}
