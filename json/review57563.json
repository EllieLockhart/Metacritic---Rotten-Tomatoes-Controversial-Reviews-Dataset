Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the epitome of rotten tomatoes: the worst Star Wars  movie of all times!!\\ngood time.  The audience where I was warching it booed and many walked out!  And I almost fell asleep during some of the excruciatingly protracted scenes of pursuit in space\\, when I was not dispairing to have to listen to dumb dialogues or watch Leia slap one of her best heroes (27 takes for that scene: was Rian Johnson enjoying that?)\\, or having nothing better to tell Luke than \\\"I changed my hair style\\\". or fly in space without a suit\\, as if she suddenly became Superman and immortal\\, when she was dead  in real life\\, and this was how her image was used post-mortem : not to further the story\\, but to ridicule it!  The use of Mark Hamill was also particularly revolting\\, contrary to all that his character stood for\\, and killing him off in the end so offhandedly was an added insult.   I just hate that film more than any I've ever seen although I usually am quite broadminded about movies. But\\, I will definitely avoid in the future those which feature the name of Rian Johnson.","true":true}
