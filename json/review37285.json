Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot and subplots make no sense and lead nowhere. They could've skipped them and it wouldn't make much of a difference. Even if you are not a Star Wars fan\\, you can easily notice the plot holes and poor writing. By the end of it I just felt sad and disappointed.","true":true}
