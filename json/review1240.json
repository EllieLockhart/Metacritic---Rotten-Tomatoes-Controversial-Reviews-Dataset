Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apparently obvious that Rian Johnson neither cares or understands character development or the importance of characters like Luke to the Star Wars universe. Terribly unfunny\\, misses out on numerous opportunities to do something with the material provided by Abrams and Kasdan and ultimately leaves us with perhaps one of the most embarrassing scenes in Star Wars history. It's one thing to be a risky filmmaker but it's an entirely different thing when you squander two and a half hours of film to do nothing of interest. Throwing away interesting characters like they're disposable napkins is just stupid. Blatant incompetence. Watch the original trilogy and end it there.","true":true}
