Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the last Jedi is a great middle to a sweeping new trilogy. The movie has some minor flaws but also amazing moments. Overall it manages to present answers\\, questions\\, and challenges in equal parts. I look forward to seeing the conclusion of this turbulent middle chapter concluded in episode 9.","true":true}
