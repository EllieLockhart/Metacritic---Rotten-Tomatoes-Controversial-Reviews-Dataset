Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am saying this as a casual movie goer. Not as a mega fan of Star Wars\\, or someone who was heavily invested in the movie emotionally like some people. It is not a good movie. The acting in certain parts is bland\\, the Casino scene was unnecessary\\, the Leia scene was odd and did not fit with the rest of the movie. It could have been used as an emotional point in the movie that set the tone for how dire the situation was\\, instead it looked like a scene from Man of Steel when he flies to save Lois. Mark Hamil was good\\, but his character almost seemed wasted at points. I'm not sure why the critic rating is so high\\, but it was certainly a well below average movie.","true":true}
