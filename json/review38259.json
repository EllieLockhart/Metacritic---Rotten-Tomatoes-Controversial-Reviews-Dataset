Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The whole movie I felt punched in the face by Rian Johnsons decisions to screw everything up. The Story of Fin and Rey total garbage ... everything what JJ did to set up a huge potential for a story was dumped by him. Snoke\\, Leia\\, Chewbacca and Luke were a complete waste... these fucking Porgs are bullshit and the whole plot has so many holes... Huge disappointment","true":true}
