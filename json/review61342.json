The story has ruined just about everything that was good about the first game.  This was one of the worst stories I have ever had the misfortune of finding.  I'm not sure what they were thinking but this isn't it.  There was only one part I actually enjoyed and it was the museum flashback.  The gameplay is pretty good and so is the setting.  This isn't what I was looking for though\\, I wanted a good story and this did not deliver.  It seems like all the big gaming magazines and companies gave it a great review and it makes me wonder if we even played the same game.\r\rOne of my main complaints is that the first game had so much character development and this one had none.  Most of what happened in this game was a flashback and it jumped around so much you have to really pay attention.  It also seems like they try to force you to like a character in the game and it just doesn't work.\r\rGoogle and Amazon seem to be blocking reviews.  It was a bad game\\, let the gamers review it.  I bought the game and have completed it and my reviews are still being taken down or blocked.\r\rTo summarize\\, I would ignore Part 2 and just enjoy the first game.  I thought I wanted Part 2 but after seeing what they created\\, for the first time in my life\\, I wish it didn't exist.  If there is one thing I wish I could forget\\, it is this game.  This game was so terrible I do not recognize this as an actual sequel to the masterpiece that was the original.  As South Park would say this was an \\\"f you\\, you'll buy it\\\" product.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
