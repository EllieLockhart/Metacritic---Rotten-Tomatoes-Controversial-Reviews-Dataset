Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long\\, long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away.... The 8th Episode The Last Jedi NEVER EXISTED ... Aaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!! The offbeat comedy sucked and was displaced. It seemed like they were making fun of the previous episodes and characters. The story that Force Awakens set up was ignored as \\\"so what\\\" .. The Tinkerbell incident with Leia when she got blown out was stupid.. Snoke's death was the dumbest ending i could ever think of... YES\\, the Plagueis backstory would have been perfect... AND WFT with Luke?!?!? Crazy Yoda syndrome!!! Finn and Plasma .. too easy.. and Ffff'en Disney this is NOT a Mickey Mouse candy ass trip for kids!!! Ruin your next set of SW Trilogies\\, NOT the existing Skywalker story that is close to ending and Lucas-perfect as-is! We just want a perfect ending to the story\\, why is that so hard Disney\\, you make your money anyway... So get it right for future generations to come!!!!","true":true}
