Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker turned into a grumpy excruciatingly annoying old man\\, who dies out of excitement after turning himself into a space traveling ghost? Speaking of space traveling\\, Leia turned into a space traveling Superwoman? The blue hair Tumbrelina sacrifices herself by driving the rebel capital ship into the 1st. Order ship? How about using a droid for that? And this are just a few of the endless stream of nonsensical crap in this movie. The worse Star Wars up to date. You'll lose a few IQ points after watching this!","true":true}
