Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the trolls who are only here to make trouble. They were clearly unloved as children.\\n\\nThis is a fresh\\, well thought out take on SW that we have not seen on the big screen before (though we have seen much of it in the in-canon animated series).\\n\\nNothing here is truly out of step with any of the other eight movies (the seven episodes and ROGUE ONE) or the TV shows. In fact\\, this is probably the most thought provoking film in the universe to date and deserves repeated viewings.\\n\\nAs someone who has lived with SW for 40 years\\, I can state confidently this is an excellent entry in the series and something I've waited for since 1980.","true":true}
