Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is comically bad. It tries to be funny and lighthearted but is so silly that it comes across as a spoof of itself\\, and undermines its own drama. Star Wars was never good at character development\\, but there is none in this movie\\, the storyline is riddled with gaping plotholes\\, the Canto Bight storyline could have been cut without changing the plot\\, and good actors like Domhnall Gleeson are forced into truly atrocious performances. When I saw the movie none in the audience cheered or clapped\\, and\\, even worse\\, none went for the laughs. I was just flabbergasted how terrible this movie was.","true":true}
