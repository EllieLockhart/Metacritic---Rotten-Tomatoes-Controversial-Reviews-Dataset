Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like Rian Johnson signed on to make a movie\\, and only THEN read the Force Awakens script\\, and he said \\\"Aww hell nah\\\" and proceeded to amputate everything that didn't fit his idea. I think this film axed more characters and amputated more plotlines than it left standing. This movie basically rolled back all of TFA\\, badly\\, awkwardly\\, and without any skill. If this guy is making a whole TRILOGY of Star Wars movies\\, that could end up being the end of Star Wars.","true":true}
