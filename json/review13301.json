Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do want to like this movie. I agree with a lot of what\u2019s already been said. The movie itself didn\u2019t really have a plot. No beginning\\, no middle\\, and no end. Force awakens had some holes but not nearly as many the Last Jedi. I hope the next film wraps this mess up. ","true":true}
