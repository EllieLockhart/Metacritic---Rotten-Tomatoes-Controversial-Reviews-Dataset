Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge star wars fan\\, someone who has been to theaters at least once for every film released since I was born\\, someone who comes from a Star wars family\\, and someone who had the highest hopes for this movie I could not have been more diasappinted. The story was poorly thought out\\, did not feel like star wars\\, wasted several golden opportunities\\,  and more than it's share  clean misses. Very poor job.","true":true}
