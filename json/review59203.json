The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"No game is perfect (except for Red Dead 2)\\, but this one is pretty good. Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us 1 were better\\, though. This one kind\u2019a feels like pure torture porn and was a real downer; could have done with some comedic relief if they didn\u2019t kill off all the likable characters just as they started to get interesting. Looking at you\\, Jesse.Overall\\, pretty good game. Story kept me interested and had me attempting to understand characters\u2019 mindsets and why they were doing the things they were doing. Which\\, nowadays\\, is pretty rare. Most games just have a bad guy who is the bad guy and you don\u2019t really have to think about anything else except for how you were going to kill them and how many more fights it would take to get to the next boss fight or cool cutscene. Gameplay was tense and engaging\\, which is always nice\\, and it never really got old for me as I was playing on really hard difficulties where I was basically fighting bros with a pair of pampers diapers stuffed inside a bottle of vodka with only a single bullet in my **** starter pistol.I know some of the **** that goes down really sucks\\, boys\\, but that shouldn\u2019t mean the game is a 0. I\u2019ve played 100+ games on my ps4 (I have pc\\, xbox 360\\, one\\, and switch) alone\\, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever played a game that was a zero. Like\\, c\u2019mon guys\\, let\u2019s be rational. If an 8 is an 80% or a B in the American education system\\, then that is what I\u2019m giving this game. I dunno\\, thought it was fun. Hopefully you can respect my opinion and I\u2019ll respect yours in return. Just wish everybody could get along\\, I guess. Makes me sad seeing us all divided over this in such a chaotic time. But\\, yeah\\, the people that are saying this game is life-altering or that it\u2019s some sort of profound piece of art need to shut up as it\u2019s really cringey. Yeah\\, I found it to be an interesting dive into the mindsets of two characters parallel to one another as well as the themes of revenge not being worth it in the end. And\\, yes\\, I did find that it tied in with the real world and connected to me on a personal level\\, as I think everyone has wanted to get back at someone for something but then realized it would be futile on the end. So\\, yeah\\, it gave me a new perspective on the idea of revenge\\, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s some life-altering piece of art\\, man. This is a game where you punch mushroom people in the face\\, it\u2019s not that deep.Anyways\\, have a good day gamers.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
