Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is like a boring fever dream. All dialoge was very awkward and the plot was all over the place. Introduced characters dont add anything and the character you love are butchered. Could only be considered good because of its huge budget. Lazy writing\\, bad characterization\\, laughable CGI\\, and the movie was so goddamn dark the intire time\\, walking out of the theatre was like walking out of mine you've been trapped in for five years. Couldn't have been worse if they tried. Definitly worse then the prequels. Save some money and watch it online.","true":true}
