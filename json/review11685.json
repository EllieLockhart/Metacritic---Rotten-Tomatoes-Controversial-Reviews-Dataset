Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How abysmally unfaithful can a movie be to the rest of the franchise?  Slapstick on the level of Spaceballs\\, but in actual Star Wars.  I thought I was watching a masterful parody snuck into the projector.","true":true}
