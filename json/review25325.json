Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No idea why this has such a high score from the critics\\, oh wait\\, yes I do\\, it's because critics are usually wrong.  This Star Wars film left me confused and sad.  So many bad decisions were made that completely ruined the characters we've grown to love over the years.  What is really depressing for me is I am not excited for the next one at all\\, and that sucks since I absolutely love Star Wars.","true":true}
