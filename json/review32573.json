Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, in my opinion\\, was a masterpiece of Star Wars lore. It was a beautiful coming of age moment for our new Star Wars sequels and artfully passed along the legacy from the classic legends to our new heroes. Every moment of the movie was the definition of \\\"Star Wars\\\" to me\\, and I am left anxiously awaiting the next installment.","true":true}
