Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see TPM in 99. Was disappointed. Went to see AOC. Disappointed. Went to see ROS\\, same. TFA\\, Disappointed. RO\\, a little less disappointed. And now TLJ and yes more disappointment. \\nWon't stop me from paying to see future Star Wars movies. They make great trailers.","true":true}
