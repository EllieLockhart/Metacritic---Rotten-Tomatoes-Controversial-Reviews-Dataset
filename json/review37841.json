Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some nice things about this film\\, But Rey's perfect character\\, The try-hard comedy\\, universe-breaking moments\\, pointless plot twists. the nonlinear slaughter of Luke\\, Snoke\\, and Phasma\\, not to mention that so many vehicles\\, sub-plots\\, and concepts were copied from Episode V just ruin it.","true":true}
