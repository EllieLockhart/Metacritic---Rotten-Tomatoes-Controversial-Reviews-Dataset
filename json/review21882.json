Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just not very good. A few worthwhile one off scenes\\, but that's about it. Daisy and Adam are fine as their characters and the best parts are certainly theirs. This movie just ruins Luke Skywalker and the Jedi. So many flaws. I've enjoyed other films by this director\\, but this one left me pretty cold. Anyone comparing this to Empire must be talking about a bad episode of the TV show. I just don't understand with so many talented people involved how they can lay such a rotten egg. Better than the\\nprequels\\, but not by much.","true":true}
