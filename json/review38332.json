Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst of all Star Wars movies. Doesn't add nothing to the story that was set in episode 7 (By far better movie than this one...)  and its only purpose is to promote some SJW agendas. I hope JJ Abrams does some magic and somehow solve all this mess in episode 9 .","true":true}
