Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie! In Episode VIII\\, there was a deeper look into the dark side\\, and yet there are strong overtones of hope. There was lots of classic Star Wars action\\, with bits of salty-sweet humor (a la Han who we miss) sprinkled in throughout for a wonderful blend of nostalgia & new fun. All in all\\, a truly great addition to the series\\, and I am excited to see where some of the foreshadowing breadcrumbs will take us next.","true":true}
