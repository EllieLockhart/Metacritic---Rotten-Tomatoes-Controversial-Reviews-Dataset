Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Three question I have after seeing this movie...\\n\\n1.  Did Rian Johnson see The Force Awakens (or any other episode for that matter)?\\n\\n2.  What exactly was the plot of this movie?\\n\\n3.  What are we left with to look forward to in episode IX?  All of my favorite heroes are dead and anyone that was interesting in VII was wasted in this mess.  Were left with social crusader Rose...pass.","true":true}
