Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an educator I look at all students the same way\\, women or men. I don't even care. \\n\\nHowever\\, if you want good grades\\, you have to work hard for it. This movie is counter to that thesis\\, and in a very strong\\, willful way.\\n\\nIt is a bad influence on kids. I am very disappointed in the mainstream media\\, which in their eagerness to push a feminist agenda\\, ignores this important value for a society to succeed: meritocracy.","true":true}
