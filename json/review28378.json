Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the most iconic fictional character of all time thrown away in a disrespectful inconsistent character assassination.\\n\\nMultiple loose and incoherent plot lines that ultimately come to nothing.\\n\\nALL ideas introduced by the previous entry went unanswered. \\nKnights or Ren\\, Snoke\\, Phasma\\, Rey's identity\\, ending of the Jedi\\, nope none of that matters\\, forget all of it.\\n\\nActual directorial WTF moments like Leia force witching herself out of space with no commentary afterwards.\\n\\nThere are pages and pages online of why this movie was shit - it's the only movie I've ever seen that literally made me wish it didn't exist.","true":true}
