Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a huge SW fan\\, I was really discouraged after reading all of the negative reviews and went into the theater with low expectations. I don\u2019t know if that helped\\, but I really liked this episode. It was far from great\\, but hardly as terrible as many have made it out to be. While I agree with some of the negative comments\\, it\u2019s my opinion that they are being overly dramatic and blown out of proportion. I also think that people\u2019s expectations might just be unrealistic. If this had been any other movie without the history and expectations of the SW franchise\\, I think this would have landed around the 85% mark from users. I encourage anyone who is a true fan to ignore the drama and go enjoy the movie.","true":true}
