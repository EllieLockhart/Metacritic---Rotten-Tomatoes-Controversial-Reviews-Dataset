Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just saw Mark Hamill's before and after movie expressions. He says it better than I can with his emotion. Elation to a despondant depression in less than 150 minutes. I lo e Star Wars. i saw the original four times\\, including at the Odean cinema in Lecester square\\, queueing round the block in the snow. I have no desire to watch another Disney produced movie\\, especially if made by R. Johnson. They want the next generations money? No problem. But they didn't have to dump on Luke  and the original trilogy to do it. I'm done.\\n\u00d1","true":true}
