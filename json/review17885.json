Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has great action\\, fun\\, and funny.  It has unexpected turns\\, and this one truly hands over the Star Wars story to the new characters\\, instead of\\, being weighed down by the previous trilogies.","true":true}
