Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't watch. Total trash. The story will infuriate you. Garbage of a film. What a disgrace. There is no conspiracy Disney\\, Fans just hate it. and to those who got brainwash by the cheap humor and fancy effects\\, Good for you.","true":true}
