Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unoriginal movie that tries to destroy the history of the franchise by killing of beloved characters and at the same time ripping the original Trilogy (Remember that rebel soldier dragging his foot and stating \\\"It's salt\\\" just so we knew that and with that they were not completely ripping off the battle of HOTT!!) It was too long\\, boring\\, unoriginal and just bad! This movie is the last SW movie I will see!!","true":true}
