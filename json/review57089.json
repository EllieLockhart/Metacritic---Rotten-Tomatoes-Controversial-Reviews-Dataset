Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a alright movie at best\\, but a horrible Star Wars movie at its worse. It lacks respect for rules and characters essential to telling a star wars story. It may be time for a change in this predictable format but it should not have been done like this.","true":true}
