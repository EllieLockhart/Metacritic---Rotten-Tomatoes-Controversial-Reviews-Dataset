Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an original Star Wars fanboy I'm shocked at the reactions of some hardcore fans to this movie.  The professional critics have it right.  This is a great movie.  It's full of surprises that make sense for the character arcs and the themes of the film.  An old favorite character tells us what it's all about-failure and learning from it.  Almost all the major characters learn from their failures.  There are beautiful action sequences and giant moments.  Hamill\\, Ridley\\, Fisher and Driver are fantastic.  It's emotional\\, exciting and truly fresh and original.  As much as I enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, this film has more to say\\, doesn't rely so heavily on nostalgia and moves the franchise forward in an astonishing way.","true":true}
