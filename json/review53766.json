Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great evolution of a great series. Yes there was a fair amount of dismantling going on but I appreciate why Johnson did it. The film sets up the future of Star Wars beautifully!! Very re watchable because each character has their own growing pains to deal with and then there is the overarching story as well. Beautiful cinematography and new interesting creatures and worlds to play with. Well acted by all. Yes this is ending the Skywalker legacy but allows for a broadening within the Star Wars universe.
