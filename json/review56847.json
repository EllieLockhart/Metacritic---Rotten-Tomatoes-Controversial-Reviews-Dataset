Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reason I have given Star Wars The Last Jedi a half star is for violating the lore. It's supposed to take decades of studying in order to become proficient at utilizing the force and a lightsaber. All Luke did was tell Rey the definition of what the force is. Becoming a Jedi or Sith is a dedication of one's life to learning the mystery's of the force\\, it is a lifestyle\\, you can't become a Jedi just by learning the definition of the force. Anakin Skywalker\\, the chosen one\\, did not become a powerhouse immediately. It took him decades to hone his force and lightsaber abilities before he reached his prime. For example\\, if someone told me the definition of \\\"Law\\\"\\, I can't just go immediately pass the bar exam and become a lawyer. I would have to dedicate several years studying in law school just to pass the bar exam. The fact that Rey was able to use the force and a lightsaber as effectively as she did in the movie is a blatant violation of the Star Wars mythos.\\n\\nThere are seven lightsaber forms (Shii-Cho\\, Makashi\\, Soresu\\, Ataru\\, Shien\/Djem So\\, Niman\\, and Juyo\/Vaapad) that can take years just to master one of them. It takes at least one year to learn the first lightsaber form Shii-Cho(Form One)\\, which is the lightsaber form that all Jedi must learn first as it teaches the basics of wielding a lightsaber. Shii-Cho(Form One) is the most basic of all forms and is taught to Jedi younglings as a foundation\\, and includes the fundamentals of stance\\, attack\\, parry\\, and landing a \\\"Mark of Contact\\\". The strengths of Shii-Cho (Form One) are that it is the best form against multiple opponents and has good blaster deflection. However\\, Shii-Cho (Form One) weakness is that it's the least suitable form for lightsaber dueling. Meaning even if Rey had mastered Shii-Cho(Form One)\\, she would have been guaranteed to be defeated by Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel. For Kylo Ren had studied under Luke Skywalker and Snoke for years. As a result\\, Kylo Ren would have been able to learn more of the advanced lightsaber forms that are better suited for lightsaber combat\\, which would give him the edge over Rey.\u00a0","true":true}
