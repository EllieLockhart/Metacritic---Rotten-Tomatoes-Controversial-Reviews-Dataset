Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see an epic Luke Skywalker moment that will get me thrilled\\, want to be a jedi. Want to relive the moment of wonder when i first saw SW. Instead i've seen the worst SW movie of all time in terms of story and the plot. Visually and technically this movie was very well made but it fell short on many points. This movie has more plot holes than any other movie i've seen.","true":true}
