Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Liked the original  six movies? Well be prepared to have that all thrown away because Rian Johnson clearly doesnt understand how to involve continuity of George Lucas's vision. Only thing good about this movie is that its visually pleasing to watch.","true":true}
