Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Stuff: Luke is good\\, including his jokes\\, Luke's perfect \\\"Jedi-like\\\" duel with Kylo\\, Yoda's cameo\\, Kylo and Rey vs the guards is great.\\n\\nBad Stuff: The casino planet\\, too many jokes\\, Snoke's random death\\, Rey is too powerful\\, Poe is just an a-hole hot head that learns nothing\\, Leia's force crap scene\\, Rose sucks\\, there's no politics and no first order backstory.","true":true}
