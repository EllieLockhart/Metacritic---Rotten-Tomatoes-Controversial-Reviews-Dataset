Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why some people may have mixed views on this. I left the cinema in a daze before it started to settle and found myself coming down on the 'that was really good' side. From the first scene on I knew it was not going to just rehash the past films but reset and renew. For those who worship the old films this change is unsettling - I found it invigorating and I'm more eager to see the next one.","true":true}
