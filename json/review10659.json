Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had hope that it could build from the last film but it didn't. Awful plot\\, acting\\, characters and scenes that made no sense. Nothing memorable at all happens and I couldn't care less about the next film","true":true}
