Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never have I walked out of a cinema post viewing and felt so confused or let down - I had high expectations for Last Jedi and it failed miserably. It felt rushed with too many plot holes; the whole Canto Bight section jarred with the rest of the film; questions raised in The Force Awakens were ignored and not answered such as who is Snoke and where are the Knights of Ren. Worst of all is the depiction of Luke Skywalker - Mark Hamill's acting is not the issue here at all\\, it's the director's lack of understanding about his character and having no basic grasp of Star Wars lore that is at fault. The only shining light in this whole mess is the undeniable chemistry between Rey and Kylo Ren - I truly believed their shared loneliness and need for comfort in each other - but sadly it can't save the sinking ship which is this second installment.","true":true}
