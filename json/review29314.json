Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy serve up their political agenda to the horror of all who loved this franchise. This film killed Star Wars for me. I just don't care anymore and am not even looking forward to any more films.","true":true}
