Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Occassional enjoyable elements illuminate the long long\\, god its so long and often very stupid film.  Cast are great but because of the terrible pacing\\, the many many plot holes are glaring throughout.  Very poor.","true":true}
