Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long fan this movie ruined star wars for me. If you are a original star wars fan pretend this doesnt exist. Episode 8 answered hardly any questions from previous film and the answers we did get were HUGE let downs. The humor was forced and childish (not in a good way). Also the way luke Skywalker is portrayed was like a slap in the face. The list goes on and on. Disney could care less about fans its all about money. Will not be seeing episode 9.","true":true}
