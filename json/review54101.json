Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what I was expecting\\, but this movie was not it.  It's only slightly better than Attack of the Clones\\, which is probably my least favorite Star Wars movie.  The pacing was terrible; side-plots that amount to nothing\\, introducing what feel like total throw-away characters\\, keeping the audience in the dark about some dumb trump-card strategy the heroes are trying (and failing) to accomplish.  At two and a half hours\\, this becomes grueling to endure.  This movie is about failing and taking nearly pointless actions just to give the characters screen time.\\n\\nOppose this with Empire Strikes Back\\, which is about bouncing back from defeat.  It gives the lessons the characters take feel meaningful and give them a direction.  Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and the new Rose just kind of keep doing what they always do.  There is no lesson learned\\, really\\, and the audience doesn't have to much to think about.\\n\\nThat said\\, Mark Hamill is a gem.  Several scenes with him\\, however\\, leave me scratching my head about why I didn't like them as much as I feel like I was intended to.\\n\\nIt's still Star Wars\\, but... maybe I'm getting too old for this.","true":true}
