It's very human to become focused on one goal\\, and lose sight of everything else on the way.\r\rTLOU2 requires an amount of emotional empathy on the players part. You will need to think about what is going on in someone else's head. It may not conform to how you feel at the time\\, but you have to be capable to discard your thoughts and feelings and empathise with someone else. You're an actor in a story\\, rather than a participant making choices.\r\rJust like the real world\\, there are no good or bad people. We just do what we think is right at the time\\, and our actions have either negative or positive consequences\\, based on your viewpoint. We are all also imperfect - we make mistakes\\, and we make irrational choices based on our emotions.\r\rThe game makes a point of making the player reconsider their first impressions\\, and perhaps admit to themselves that what they thought originally was not entirely correct. We are all guilty of instantly judging a person based on a single action\\, without knowing the full context about why they would do it.\r\r\\\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view\u2026 Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\\\"\r\rI thought the cinematic direction\\, cinematography\\, acting and story were all excellent. I found the gameplay very enjoyable too. No game is perfect\\, but by current gaming standards\\, this is as good as it gets. 10\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
