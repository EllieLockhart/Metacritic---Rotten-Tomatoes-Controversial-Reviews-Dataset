Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted desperately to love this movie. Perhaps it was saddled with a bad premise established in the TFA. The dynamic between the First Order and the resistance has never made sense. This movie had huge plot holes. The fight choreography was terrible. Kylo Ren is not menacing in the least. Instead\\, he comes across as a petulant\\, spoiled brat. Rey was better but still fell short of making me care about her character\/want to root for her. Finn character continues to be a bit useless and a waste of Boyega. Finally\\, I agree with Hamill that This is not the story arc that made sense for Luke Skywalker. His character deserved better. Rian Johnson ruined Luke for me. ","true":true}
