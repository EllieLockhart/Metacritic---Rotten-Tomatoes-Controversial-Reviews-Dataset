Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I genuinely went into this movie looking for gripes. Beside some pacing issues and a sort of lackluster subplot\\, I thought this movie was great. It did some new bold stuff with Star Wars and I thought Rian Johnson\u2019s Kurosawa-inspired approach was really fitting for the material. All the actors were good and there were some truly jaw-dropping scenes. I\u2019d give it like an 8.7 out of 10 if I\u2019m getting real specific.","true":true}
