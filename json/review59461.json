The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Mechanically and technically\\, this game is good\\, with beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay. But that doesn't make the game good standalone. The story is forced and poorly written. It is not the concept of Joel's death that boggles my mind\\, but more the fashion in which he dies. An amazing well thought out character with the most dishonorable death one can imagine. Ellie's personality pulls a complete 180 and now apparently is the antagonist. You must play as Abby for nearly half of the game despite the game supposedly being from Ellie's point of view\\, and Naughty Dog forces you to \\\"sympathize\\\" with Abby via a load of forced cutscenes that attempt to make the player feel for Abby. The ending is ridiculous in how Ellie has one flashback of Joel and decides to forgive Abby for everything despite killing many to reach Abby and losing two fingers in the process. That alongside the fact that Joel\\, by no means\\, was a pacifist\\, so a vision of Joel should only make Ellie's want for revenge stronger. Further\\, on Joel's death\\, Joel survived in this world for nearly 26 years\\, he would know not to reveal all of his information to a couple of strangers that he just met. Joel is the man that ran over a man pretending to be hurt because he knew it was an ambush. He also is the man that left a family on the side of the road in the VERY beginning of the outbreak\\, so Joel has no reason to give away all that he did. With all of that\\, the game gets worse with the obvious political agenda that ND and Druckmann have going on with this game. For example\\, during the party\\, after Dina and Ellie kissed\\, Seth called them a not so nice word\\, the next day\\, he made them sandwiches and genuinely seemed sorry\\, but Ellie was not forgiving\\, claiming that he is a \\\"bigot\\\"\\, yet Ellie forgives Abby\\, a murderer because she had a flashback of Joel.\r\rIn conclusion\\, it is evident that Abby has plot armor\\, that the story is poorly written and full of holes and loose ends\\, there is a lackluster ending that poorly represents the cycle of revenge\\, and there is a clear political agenda that is within this game.\rIn other words\\, just play the first one and forget this ever happened.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
