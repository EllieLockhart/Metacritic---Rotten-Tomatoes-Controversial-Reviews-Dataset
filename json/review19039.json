Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's everything Star Wars was when I was a kid. Especially Empire. It shook us to our core. TLJ does that. After seeing twice already\\, it is exactly what SW needs. To grow\\, to change to become better than it's masters. I applaud the film. It's daring\\, sometimes goofy\\, sometimes cheesy but totally what I love and want from my galaxy. I love this film. As much as I love Empire. Thank you Rian for going where you did. ","true":true}
