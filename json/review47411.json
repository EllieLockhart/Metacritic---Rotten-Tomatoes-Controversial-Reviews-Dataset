Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did they do to Luke? After revering this character in my childhood its so sad to see him reduced to a poorly written meme of a man with no motivation behind his betrayal of Ben and hatred of the force. The movie looked good but there was far too much terrible writing and it went on for too long and became a complete slog of a film. Another issue that bothered me about the plot was the fact that no one in the throne room reported Kylo killing Snoke and the last order just lets Kylo take over for their head leader without so much as a flinch. Dont even get me started on the casino sub plot. This film is sadly a mess.","true":true}
