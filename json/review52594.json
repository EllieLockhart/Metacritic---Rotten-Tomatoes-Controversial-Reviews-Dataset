Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All anyone has done is make excuses for terrible plot points in this film that couldnt even come up with an original starting off point. Filled with pointless characters that no one is given time to care about because of virtually no character development. I wish I could delete this film from my mind.","true":true}
