Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED IT. I want to see it again. The filmmakers said many times that this movie is a turning point for the saga to move on with new characters and situations. I personally want the old crew and fun back\\, and am a little war-weary\\, but hey I'm a traditionalist in many ways ... but able to embrace change. Still\\, I wish for the eye and ear candy surprises of warming up inside an animal... the bar scene\\, Old Ben being cheeky with stormtroopers\\, the enormously villainous Darth Vader\\, and all the old Skywalker magic. I miss it! So\\, I battle on with the saga and enjoy it\\, with some regrets.","true":true}
