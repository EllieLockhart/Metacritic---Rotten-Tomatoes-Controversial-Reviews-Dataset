Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I registered on this site just to write this short review and with this explain my deep dissatisfaction with the movie.\\nThe entire plot is centered on the failure of the rebels after them having overthrown the emperor at the battle of Endor. Which is fine. Rather\\, it is how this is shown in the film that is amazingly bad.\\n\\nThe most boring and non logical space-chase ever. The rebels can't outrun the gigant ship of the First order\\, who in turn can't destroy the rebels due to being out of reach. Obviously this is the lamest excuse ever. They're all in space and should expect extreme battle distances and in previous movies destroying entire planets from across severally star systems seem feasible. It's especially stupid since they're all well within freaking analog viewing distance - they can practically wave at oneanother. \\n\\nAnd then there's the meaningless sideplot on the casino world\\, the idiotic secrecy that leads to a mutiny\\, the destruction of the credebiliy of one main vallain\\,  the very unsatisfactory death of the evil Lord himself\\, the ridiculous mini deathstar battering-ram at a Star Wars ripoff of Tolkiens Helms Deep and so on and on and on.\\n\\nShortly: The worst Star Wars movie to this date. And I grew up with and loved this stuff. God. The pain.","true":true}
