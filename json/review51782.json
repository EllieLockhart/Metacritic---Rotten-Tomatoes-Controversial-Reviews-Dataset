Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Admittedly\\, the music and visuals of this movie are excellent. However\\, the terrible characterization of beloved characters like Luke Skywalker and the poor answers given to important questions (Rey's parentage) destroy what little the movie had. Not to mention how terribly drawn out the movie felt. I would not care to see this movie again.","true":true}
