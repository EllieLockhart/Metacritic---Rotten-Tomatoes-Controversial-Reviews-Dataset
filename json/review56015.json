Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shocked\\, dissappointed and angry. This movie was terrible\\, I expect Star Wars and got a christmas special. Way to many plot wholes\\, Superman Leia!? And why doesn't she die beacuase of the force\\, why does Luke!? Who the hell was Snoke!? Rey parents are nobodies?! Luke's character was destroyed and not in a good way. Finn and his side gf were pointless\\, the code breaker was pointless\\, the whole planet theu visit was pointless\\, they are looking for some code breaker with a pendant and end up not getting him?! And really\\, nobody answered the call for help? Where is Lando and Cloud City or Mon Mothma? They killed Admiral Ackbar?! To say this movie had too many plot holes is an understatement. I say save your money and wait to see it on Netflix or something. This movie actually makes me love the prequals\\, which is an amazing feat. Those who loved this movie are just drunk or living in delusion. Thanks for ruining my childhood disney. You had one job.","true":true}
