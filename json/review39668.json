Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is about as bad as I (hope) it can get. No plot. Nothing to add to the overall saga. Horribly bad acting by Hamill. My 11 year old moaned for the two and a half hours\\, while I just sat there sad.\\nUPDATE 2019 - In preparation for the release of the FINAL Star Wars\\, I went back and watched this movie again. It is the first half that I hated. The movie does improve. It is a giant disappointment after the strength of The Force Awakens. But\\, it is tolerable. Let's hope the final installment reigns.","true":true}
