Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not enjoy the movie\\, I do not blame the actors\\, but I blame Ryan Johnson for the film's quality. Disney chose a terrible screenwriter and director for this film. He changed the personality of the characters and divided the fan base. In an interview\\, he said that he liked to create a movie that would divide the fan base\\, which is a terrible idea to have when working on a beloved film such as Star Wars.","true":true}
