Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How could Rey\\, after only a couple of days of training and experience in the Star Wars universe\\, be as powerful\\, or even more so\\, than many other jedis\\, even considering Yoda? Where did Snoke get his resources? How did he influence Kylo Ren? What was so dangerous about the cave with the mirror? Why did no one tell Poe the plan\\, avoiding all the the escape plan deaths? How can Rose fall in love with Finn after 1 day? Too many absurd situations and character developments...","true":true}
