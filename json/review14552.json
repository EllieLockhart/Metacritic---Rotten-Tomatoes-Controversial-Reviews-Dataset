Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always loved the Star Wars brand\\, but this movie is the worst addition of an already overused and over marketed franchise. I have never rated a movie in my life on the internet\\, but after reading only positive reviews from movie critics I felt obligated to voice my opinion.","true":true}
