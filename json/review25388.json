Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"None of the questions we had from Force Awakens were answered\\, and the lore was disrespected. Sure\\, be bold if you want\\, but please don't disrespect the real fans by adding a cheap joke at every minute. To many new things were introduced\\, and the whole thing is inconsistent. Bring back some previous planets and species instead of making everything up.","true":true}
