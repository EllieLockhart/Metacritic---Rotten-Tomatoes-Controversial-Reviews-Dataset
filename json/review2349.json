Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Attended every Star Wars opening since Phatom and this was the first time no one clapped at the end.  Everyone leaving this movie was complaining about this movie on the way back to their cars.  This movie just felt off and and honestly didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.  Sad times for long time fans.","true":true}
