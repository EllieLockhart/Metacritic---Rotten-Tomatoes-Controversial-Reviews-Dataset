Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not a star wars movie. It's a Marvel superhero movie with a star wars skin. It has no substance. It ruins core characters from previous movies. It was horrible. This movie has killed the star wars franchise for me. It's over. I'll keep watching the old stuff and reading the expanded universe and pretend this piece of hot garbage never existed.\\n\\nThe prequels are honestly better than this piece of trash.","true":true}
