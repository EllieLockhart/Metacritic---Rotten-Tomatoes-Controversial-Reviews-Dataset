Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed with the movie. If it was a standalone movie with his own characters Ruin Johnson (spelling error intentional) could have pulled off what what he tried. Maybe. But even then\\, the store was weak\\, didn't make sense in spots and had so many plot hopes that that... Well it was just a bad story tood poorly.","true":true}
