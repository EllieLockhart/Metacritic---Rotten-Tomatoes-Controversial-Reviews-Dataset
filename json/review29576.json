Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson reinvents the Force in a way that will surely make hard core fans question the direction\\, but was necessary to ensure that the current trilogy doesn't mirror the original one.  Early on\\, it's very easy to question the direction of the film and later when it's clear you know where it's going\\, it takes an unexpected path.  Some questions are answered in full\\, but some of those answers won't satisfy everyone.  Other questions aren't answered at all\\, perhaps because you need some fodder for the third installment.  Happy to have seen it and will likely see it again\\, but this isn't the movie you've been looking for.","true":true}
