Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it.  Every character was developed further and in a more interesting way than in Force Awakens.  The plot was (mostly) very tight and well structured\\, and by about the half way point the drama ramps up and becomes an absolute thrill ride of character conflicts and weighty action scenes. Possibly the best made Star Wars film to date.","true":true}
