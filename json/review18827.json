Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a mess. This movie completely destroys everything built in the original trilogy it even destroys episode seven.\\nI don't hate it\\, it is just a bad story\\, a bad executed movie. I didn't like the direction at all\\, there were a few good moments but the story line was so messy.\\nThat's is\\, it's a bad movie\\, an small enjoyable movie for those that never seen Star Wars and just walked in to se entertainment\\, for the Star Wars fans is opposite of The Gorce Awakens\\, nothing for the fans.","true":true}
