Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was going into this movie with high expectations and a lot of excitement. After 2 years of waiting\\, I was finally going to learn more about the mysterious supreme leader Snoke\\, see Luke Skywalker in action and how powerful he is now after all this time. I thought Luke and Rey were going to build a stronger bond and Luke would show her the way and train her more. To my disappointment very little of this happened and I actually left the theater frustrated and a bit unsatisfied. I'd have to say this was my least favorite star wars film in the saga :(","true":true}
