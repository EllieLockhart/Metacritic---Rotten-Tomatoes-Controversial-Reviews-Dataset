Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot coherency is absent\\, as consistency is lost even following The Force Awakens from two years ago.. let alone the originals.  Identity politics also gives the The Last Jedi a shallow\\, myopic quality--it's a disappointment in many ways. \\n\\nThis is not a film\\, and unfortunately now likely a trilogy\\,  that will age well.","true":true}
