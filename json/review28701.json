Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Purple hair woman\\, just tell the fucking plan already! No shitty casino 30 minutes long scene would be necessary. Luke on Empire Strikes Back went for a suicide mission to bring Darth Vader back to the light side and now when he sees dark on his student that is also his nephew\\, he instantly tries to kill him WTF","true":true}
