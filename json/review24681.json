Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was good by itself\\, but it did not do a good job continuing the story from the previous film.  It is almost like the director wanted to go away from the previous film on purpose and it hurts the overall Saga.  Horrible job with Luke's character.  It doesn't fit how his character was built at all.","true":true}
