Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"sad to say that this movie has a hard time even fighting for two stars. Kylo has some character development\\, and everyone one else around him are empty shells with no character. So many character are misstreated and the plotholes are constant and really annoying.","true":true}
