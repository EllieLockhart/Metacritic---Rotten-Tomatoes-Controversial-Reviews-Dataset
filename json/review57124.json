Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first movie review on RT\\, and I can't believe its a mediocre review of a Star Wars movie.  I'm a fan\\, bottom of my heart I am\\, not extreme collecting everything\\, but I love Star Wars.  I read all the expanded universe as a teen\\, I listened to the radio dramas\\, heck some of it inspired my writing.   I didn't care for the prequels\\, but I didn't think they could get any worse.  Well they did.   The only shining light in this movie were the old characters and even one or two of the new ones were fresh and enjoyable to me.  Even so\\, it felt like more could be done with all of them.\\n\\nThe addage  of \\\"let the past die\\, kill it if you have to\\\" is used a lot by Kylo Ren\\, but I can't help but feel its become the mantra the writers were told to recite every day.  Its good to do new things\\, make new friends\\, meet new people.  Star Wars NEEDS a fresh outlook and to get beyond the Skywalkers and their story.  You don't have to copy paste the original movies.  But at the same time\\, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater\\, as it seems happened here.  \\n\\nSay what you will about the message of women empowerment in this movie. I'm all for the female characters.  I don't feel Rey is a mary sue\\, no more than Luke was in the originals. You can have a political message\\, you can have it in a movie\\, don't get me wrong\\, but make it one everyone can see and that is rounded out.  Some of the message in this movie is beaten down to the point where it feels meanspirited\\, at least to me\\, and thus\\, loses its impact.\\n\\nThere are poignant moments in episode 8 where\\, at the time\\, I was invested.  I thought\\, \\\"Wow that's cool.\\\"  As I walked out of the theater though\\, the further I got the more disappointing the movie felt\\, the more let down I was.  As I look back though\\, I wonder if I was unfair to it.  I felt like the characters I loved from the old series were let down and wasted\\, and some of the new ones were wasted too.  The end felt hollow\\, thin and frail\\, and I wasn't left with a sense of hope like I think the writers intended.  It's going to take a lot to curve the ball back around in episode IX. I suppose I just have to wait and see.","true":true}
