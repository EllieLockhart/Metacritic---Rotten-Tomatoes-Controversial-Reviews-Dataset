{"101487":169116,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2015-11-26","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So when I heard director Rian Johnson\\, a favourite filmmaker of mines responsible for the stylistic but well thought out and character driven 'Brick'\\, and the messy but well filmed and entertaining 'Looper' (and also the best episode to brace Breaking Bad: Ozymandias)\\, I was reasonably excited. The Force Awakens\\, whether you liked it or not\\, played its role in giving what it needed to kick off Star Wars in a relatively old but new fashion\\, and having in my opinion a personal talent like Rian involved was a huge deal for me\\, and made me confident that even if the recent behind the scenes troubles with Lucasfilm (like the reshooting Rogue One to be safe and the loss of Colin Trevorrow & talents Phil Lord & Chris Miller) then at least I could see people at least come to like SOMETHING out of Disney Star Wars. And when I heard Rian had a lot of creative reign over the film and that Disney and Lucasfilm were so impressed with his film they decided to allow him to create a new trilogy of his own\\, It made me a bit anxious to wonder how this film would turn out. And despite the HEFTY negative reviews that came out for the film once people got to go see it\\, I still kept my optimism in check to go see this opening day and even upon rewatching it. And while my first initial thoughts seeing it where described as being \\\"...all over the place\\\" and saying how i couldn't \\\"tell whether I REALLY liked it or hated it most of it.\\\" since so much of it was a lot to take in and digest from not being spoiled (THANKFULLY)\\, upon another rewatch I can safely say I enjoy The Last Jedi the second time around\\, but of course noticing some issues that hurt it from being better.\\n\\nAlright so\\, it's going to be nearly impossible to go fully in-depth with my thoughts without getting into some SERIOUS spoilers so as to not get into anything specific scene details I'll be linear on some plot points. But anywho\\, so seeing a second time after I can safely say my positives and negatives are more specific this time around. And what it does right is acting (Mark Hamill\\, the late Carrie Fisher\\, and especially Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver were all fantastic)\\, the new story dynamic between Kylo and Rey oozing with intrigue and brilliant character driven scenes\\, surprisingly well done and great foreshadowing and subtly both in camerawork and in the script\\, Lukes character and arc that originally I was against but I warmed up to and REALLY appreciated the nice layer of humanity it gives the character\\, Poe's personal arc of being a leader being refreshingly sympathetic to follow\\, some really well set up themes and morals about failure and finding your place in the universe that i have to appreciate as a great theme for Last Jedi to stand on its own\\, GORGEOUS almost breathtaking cinematography and especially action sequences in the second and third act\\, John Williams score serving its purpose in the film and on its own being pretty solid and better than Force Awakens\\, and really impressive world building and costume\/vehicle design that could only come from Rian. Now on the negative side\\, the second time around I had unfortunately had a lot to pick on this time around and if I had to boil it down specifically\\, it would be: Finn & Rose's subplot unfortunately not having any point to it (the Canto Bight animal run and rights message plus Rose's message about fighting for what you love were so bafflingly bad I couldn't understand how Rian came up with it and kept it in)\\, THAT Leia scene feeling still out of place though with understandable intention\\, the very end lacking any sense of moral lesson to any of the new characters arcs and journeys and puts the reset switch for seemingly no reason at all\\, the humour feeling way to overused this time around (trust me im fine with humour in Star Wars\\, it's always been there since A New Hope but here was used too much to break tension in otherwise great scenes)\\, and had a dragging pacing through the first half.\\n\\nSo overall\\, The Last Jedi I think is a good example of showing Star Wars as a franchise as its best but also unfortunately at its worst. And despite the negatives the film does have\\, I think it's not enough to be as bad as the prequels (as some have claimed) and not enough to make it awful. Its main issue I think is that because it doesn't explore the new characters themes of failure and finding your place in the universe MORE it unfortunately makes the film in execution feel messy and resetting it all at the end doesn't necessarily help either. Overall though I enjoyed it for what it tried doing and I had fun with it\\, despite what i've said about it not working. I give props for Rian Johnson for trying his best what he was given and for trying to take some risks\\, but overall I can't shake the feeling as if it could've been much better. Still though\\, it should be noted when the film is doing its own thing it's at Star Wars best we've ever seen it\\, and that should not be glossed over.\\n\\nScore: 7.5 \/ 10","true":true}
