Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is completely destroys the history\\, feeling\\, and classic characters of the Star Wars Universe.  Disney and Lucasfilm are either incapable of telling good Star Wars stories or they are just looking to mine Star Wars for as much money as they can make with as little effort as possible.  I'm going with the later theory.  Star Wars is just being turned in to another franchise like the Transformers where no one at the top really cares about quality and story it's all about how many new characters can we make people buy merchandise for.  Sadly as long as we the movie goers continue to pay for tickets to this horror the longer Disney will thumb there noses and keep doing what makes them so much profit.","true":true}
