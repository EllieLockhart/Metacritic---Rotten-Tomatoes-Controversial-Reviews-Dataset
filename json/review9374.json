Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gimme a break.  Visually stunning but it's the same movie every time.  Chase\\, bang\\, see you next time.  If the baddies had used the weapons they had film would have been over in the first five minutes.  They actually had a chance to do something different with the \\\"cannon\\\" scene but just chickened out thus each episode has no drama as stakes are never life and death.  It's filmmaking by numbers.","true":true}
