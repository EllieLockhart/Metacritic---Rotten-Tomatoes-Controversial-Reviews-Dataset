Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time\\, I liked it\\, but a lot to take in.  I love Rey and Kylo Ren characters.  They are driving the movie.  It retains the same values as all of the star wars and is more likely to pull in new viewers with characters they can relate to.","true":true}
