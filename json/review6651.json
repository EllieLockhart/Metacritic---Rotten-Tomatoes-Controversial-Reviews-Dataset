Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the critic's review becuase they are all payed by Disney.\\nAny person with a brain will see the lazy writing and the bad characters this movie has. And let's not talk about the countless plot holes this movie creates. Don't see it if you want to enjoy Star Wars.","true":true}
