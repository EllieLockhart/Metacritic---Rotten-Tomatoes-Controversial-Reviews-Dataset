Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, this has destroyed everything every previous film has created; even for the new trilogy of 7\\,8 and 9 - this has undone almost all of Force Awakens. \\nAs a film in general\\, ignoring the fact that it exists in a pre-established universe (which you can't)\\, the story is terrible. No character development\\, and there are NO stakes. You do not fear for a character's safety after the impossible feats seen in the first act.","true":true}
