Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was the most dissapointing sequel in the history of movies. Asides from 2 cool action scenes\\, a great soundtrack and nice visuals the movie itself is horrible. Luke Skywalker goes in a horrible direction\\, the movie has a lot of misplaced humor\\, lots of things set up in episode 7 get tossed aside or solved without giving the viewers any statisfaction. Disney is trying to make it for the general public and insults the fans who hold the franchise dearly. I went out the theater dissapointed and angry\\, really don't like how this ended up. Not excited for episode 9 whatsoever.","true":true}
