Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"never senn such a bad sequal... ignoring th eMovie bevor ein all ways.. and also destroed the characters from before. No character development and a directless story. and big Plotholes on and on... ive never believed a Star wars movie could be so bad ... thank u disney","true":true}
