Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fue una absoluta decepci\u00f3n\\, mataron literalmente a mi h\u00e9roe de la infancia solo para dar un plot twist sin sentido\\, y la nueva \\\"heroina\\\" ni siquiera se merece lo que tiene porque no ha pagado ning\u00fan precio\\, la hicieron perfecta solo para empatizar con los movimientos feministas y aun hasta las mujeres les molesta que sean tan condescendientes jaja dan asco y verg\u00fcenza ajena el director Johnson y la productora Kennedy. J. J Abrams por favor salva esta porqueria! ","true":false}
