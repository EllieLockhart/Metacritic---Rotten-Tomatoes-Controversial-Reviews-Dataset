Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A big disappointment for a life-long Star Wars fan. Waited 30+ years to see a worthy sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy where Luke Skywalker finally gets to show off\\, and instead we got this paint by numbers mess of a story. So much potential squandered. But hey\\, I'm sure it will make a ton of money for Disney\\, who actually cares about making a genuinely well constructed story.","true":true}
