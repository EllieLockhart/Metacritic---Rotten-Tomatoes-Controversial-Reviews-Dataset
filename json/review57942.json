Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When agenda overshadows the story.  I want Rey to he ultra powerful.  I want to see Star Wars: The Force Unleashed power from her.  I want to see a strong female character on the level of the trailer for Star Wars: The Old Republic\\, where she stops a lightsaber with her bare hand.  But I don't want that power to make no sense.  Vader\\, as a child prodigy of the force\\, still needed training.  Rey\\, having no training\\, no backstory\\, and no explanation; is able to stand up to Kylo Ren after she learned the force existed \\\"yesterday.\\\"  And what happened \\\"yesterday?\\\"  Kylo stopped a sniper blast mid air and stopped the sniper all in one gesture.  To say that the writing of her character is amateur-level would be a huge compliment.  It's like her character was written by a 4 year old.  And it diminishes other characters that she is able to stand toe to toe with.  And I'm sorry\\, but killing off both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker the way they did...it's insulting.  Episode 7 was just Episode 4 again\\, and Episode 8 was a spit in the face to the source material.  So far both movies are completely unbearable.  The only thing that they have going for them is good CGI.  The movies are beautiful.  But the story is a dumpster fire at best.","true":true}
