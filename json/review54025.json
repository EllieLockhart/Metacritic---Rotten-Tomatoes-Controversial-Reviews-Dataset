Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe it. I'm actually... pretty torn after first viewing. And I'm an accepting fanboy who ate the prequels and The Force Awakens up and loved them. Had no doubt whatsoever that I would love this movie. I never thought in a million years I would leave the theatre slightly disappointed by a Star Wars movie. But I did. \\n\\nTo be clear\\, there were definitely good things about The Last Jedi. A few good laughs. Some really cool moments and creatures. Absolutely beautiful scenes and cinematography. Yoda's cameo. The poetic double-suns for Luke at the end. But so many of the character and story choices are really bothering me. \\n\\nLuke attempting to assassinate his own nephew and dying before we ever got to see him fight. Floating Leia. Rey forgeting that Kylo Ren is an unstable psycho who murdered Han literally yersterday. Supreme Almighty Snoke killed early in the movie with no explanation. Luke passing all the responsibility on to Rey with no training or instruction.  Big letdown with barely touching on any of the Dark\/Light\/Grey force lore that was hinted at in all the promotions. Purple Hair stealing Leia's heroic send-off. Hmmmmm. Oh yeah\\, and no lightsaber duels? Come on\\, man! \\n\\nMaybe it will grow on me. Gonna see it another time or two and give it more time to digest. But as of this moment\\, possibly my least-favorite Star Wars film. Well-made\\, but ultimately unfulfilling.","true":true}
