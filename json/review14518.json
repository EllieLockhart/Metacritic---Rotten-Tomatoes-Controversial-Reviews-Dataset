Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate the way they're going with these new movies. The Star Wars films were always supposed to be centered around the Skywalker family and yet Disney has decided to kill any and all connections with the Skywalkers. Rey is still an unexplained \\\"Mary Sue\\\" who is good at everything with no training. The only good character is Ren\\, never thought i'd say that but he had good character development in the film. Disney also decided to make this film more political\\, all the bad guys are white and the good guys are black. As a black man myself I simply am pointing this out as I think this will only make things worse in my country the U.S.","true":true}
