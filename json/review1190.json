Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A person who just said his 10 year old son said the movie \\\"doesn't make sense\\\" saw through all the flash and excitement that was on the screen. He also said the critics must have been paid off by Disney. Actually I see it as Disney is the new juggernaut that can ruin a critics livelihood if he or she doesn't buy into what they want them to portray. Say the wrong thing and you will be an outcast and not have access to Disney.","true":true}
