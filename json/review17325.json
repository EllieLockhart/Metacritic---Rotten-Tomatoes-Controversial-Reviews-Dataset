Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really want to like it\\, but I remember being restless in the theater waiting for the story line to pick up or cover major plot points. The humor didn't work with me\\, unlike previous installments. At best\\, it wastes a lot of time\\, at worst\\, it throws everything from episode 7 out the window\\, which will make rewatching The Last Jedi pointless as I can't trust that Episode 9 won't throw everything this movie established out the window too.","true":true}
