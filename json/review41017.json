Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fails on so many ways\\, script\\, dialog\\, plot advancement\\, the list goes on. Rian Johnson wrote and directed this train wreck of a movie\\, but it's still shocking that no one around him was able to point out these issues and correct the course. \\n\\nMark Hamill himself tried to point out deeply flawed character inconsistencies in the script to no avail. It would seem that even the actors Rian grew up watching in series were unable to topple his massive ego to create \\\"his vision\\\"\\, which unfortunately for Star Wars fans is the most disrespectful\\, ridiculous\\, boring direction to take the series - in addition to just plain bad writing and direction. \\n\\nEasily the worst in the series. Even Phantom Menace was at least simply misguided. TLJ treats it's audience\\, cast\\, and lore with nothing short of contempt.","true":true}
