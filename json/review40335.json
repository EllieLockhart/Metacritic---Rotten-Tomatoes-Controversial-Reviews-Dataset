Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made. If you removed Jar Jar\\, the prequels would have been better than The Last Jedi. This movie completely breaks continuity with Force Awakens so many times it makes me sick. There are unnecessary subplots\\, forced love interests\\, and it's very heavy handed for merchandising and not subtle about it. It shoves social justice crusades down the viewers throats.","true":true}
