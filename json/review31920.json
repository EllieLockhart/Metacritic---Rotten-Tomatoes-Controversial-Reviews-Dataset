Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler free reaction: Incredible theatrical experience! If you were the type that complained The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope\\, Rian Johnson has delivered for you in a big way. A fresh story breaking new ground in the Star Wars saga. Nothing in this 2 hour and 30 minute epic is predictable. Can't wait to see where we go in the next chapter. Five stars!","true":true}
