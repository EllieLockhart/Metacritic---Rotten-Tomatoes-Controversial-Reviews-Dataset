{"101487":169330,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER-FREE SECTION:\\nIt had fun parts to it: nice set pieces\\, Mark Hamill was great as was Carrie Fisher\\, a few neat twists with The Force\\, and some good combat. The rest of the movie\\, things like the story\\, the plot\\, the character development\\, the villains\\, a few of the heroes\\, logic\\, reason\\, military tactics or strategy\\, even down to what the hell they even call themselves - Rebels or The Resistance - are so mind-bogglingly confused that the entire movie makes no f-ing sense whatsoever.\\n\\nSPOILER WARNING: FROM HERE ON\\, THAR BE SPOILERS.\\nPros: Mark Hamill's performance\\, given the crap he was written to perform in the script\\, was amazing. He brought enough nuance and light touches of comedy to make him riveting to watch. Same with Carrie Fisher; her last outing as Leia was pretty good overall\\, though her interactions with Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron were more quippy than substantive (in a real military setting\\, she would have probably thrown him in the brig and lost the key\\, but yeah\\, keep letting him screw around on the ship\\, that's fine). The CGI graphics made for an enjoyable visual spectacle (though the cutesy creature effects turned this into a 2.5 hour long toy commercial) and some of the fight choreography with Daisy Ridley's Rey\\, Adam Driver's Kylo Ren\\, and Hamill were interesting to watch.\\n\\nCons: LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE. The plot picks up after Ep VII with the First Order pursuing the Rebelsistance to their hidden base forcing them to evacuate. Okay\\, sure. They are evacuating in shuttles up to a waiting Mon Calamari Cruiser in orbit\\, but then here comes the First Order with a new huge Dreadnought that can shell the ground installation with its enormous cannons. Enter Poe Dameron all alone in his X-Wing staring down the Dreadnought one-on-one\\, stopping cold in front of them\\, shutting down his engines\\, closing his S-foils\\, utterly defenseless... but he hails the Dreadnought and claims he has a message for General Hux as an obvious stall tactic. Why didn't they just blow him out of the sky and proceed to follow\/destroy the Rebelsistance as they fled? But no\\, Poe has a fun taunt\\, then attacks the Dreadnought to destroy its upper guns and make way for bombers to finish off the giant craft. Bombers. In space. And not like\\, these ships are heavily laden with giant munitions that we launch from a distance so let's call them bombers - no\\, they physically DROP tons of little explosive balls on their targets. WHERE THERE IS NO GRAVITY. THIS IS MONUMENTALLY STUPID. So\\, Poe recklessly gets them all killed\\, but the last bomber succeeds in destroying the Dreadnought\\, so it was all worth it... sort of.\\nThe Mon Calamari Cruiser with the remnants of the Rebelsistance jumps to hyperspace and tries to run\\, but the First Order pursue them\\, somehow being able to magically track them with some Macguffin on board their ship\\, something that has to be disabled to make their escape. Thus starts a 75-minute plus sidequest for Finn and new character Rose to some remote casino world to find a guy\\, a codebreaker\\, who can sneak aboard the flagship of the First Order\\, disable the MacGuffin device\\, then escape. In the meantime\\, the Mon Calamari Cruiser and a handful of other capital ships of the Rebelsistance are just chugging along at sub-light speeds with the First Order fleet right behind them... just barely within firing range. WHY?! It's not like the First Order has a fuel problem or any issue stopping any of their dozen or so Star Destroyers from speeding up\\, surging forward\\, flanking\\, or even calling for reinforcements to surround or obliterate them! But no\\, they'd rather sit just behind them FOR 18 HOURS taking ineffective potshots at the ass end of the cruiser FOR NO BLOODY REASON WHATSOEVER\\, giving our heroes time to try to work out how they're going to get away. This took me COMPLETELY out of the movie\\, which is sad because it's about 60% of the movie and the reason the bafflingly stupid decisions that follow are made.\\n\\nFinn and Rose go to the casino planet. I went to the bathroom. This was utterly POINTLESS\\, so I didn't even pay attention. They find him\\, they bring him back\\, and in the process\\, they free some cute animals I'll likely see as stuffed toys in my local store before too long. Convoluted plan to sneak onto ship leads to codebreaker betraying them for cash. \\n\\nMeanwhile\\, the Mon Calamari ship is attacked by Ren and a few fighters. Yay! Effectiveness! Ren targets the bridge\\, senses Leia's there\\, can't pull the trigger\\, but his wingmen bomb it instead. Leia uses the Force to pull herself back into the ship in the nick of time - a really cool moment! - but she's in the infirmary for most of the 2nd act. Time for Admiral Laura Dumb to take command! Her idea: just keep putt-putting along until the last second (since the First Order is seemingly happy to let them) and then abandon ship\\, piling everyone into transports and making a run for an abandoned Rebelsistance base on a nearby planet.\\n\\nMeanwhile\\, Rey's trying to convince Luke to return with her. He doesn't wanna go\\, but he senses she's strong with the Force and agrees to give her a few lessons. They are neat\\, but mildly inconsistent with the optimism and strength that Luke showed in the past. A few good scenes of exchanging dialogue with Rey here\\, and a bit of intrigue as to what really happened with Kylo Ren\\, but Luke never leaves his exile. Rey is convinced that Ren can be turned to the light again and turns herself into the flagship after Chewie puts her in an escape pod and drops her at their door. I'm guessing they knew he was coming and didn't fire on the Falcon\\, because otherwise\\, that made no sense either. Oh\\, almost forgot - Finn had to get as far away from the fleet as possible so Rey and Chewie didn't use their beacon to return (presumably with Luke) and get a face full of First Order turbolasers. Since she turns herself in to Ren\\, I guess that little plotpoint was absolutely unnecessary! Yay?\\n\\nRey's on the ship\\, meets the big bad Snoke\\, turns Ren enough to kill Snoke (but not before we learn ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT HIM)\\, and Rey and Ren fight Snoke's guards side-by-side like allies... even though\\, again\\, Rey STILL hasn't had any proper lightsaber training after TWO WHOLE MOVIES NOW. Then Ren tries to get Rey to join him again. They fight over and tear apart Luke's\/Anakin's blue saber\\, causing an explosion that knocks them both out\\, but somehow she escapes with the two halves of the saber and the kyber crystal still intact within it. So... what blew up? I thought that the kyber crystal would have caused the explosion\\, but... I guess their Force powers were just to awesome that they went kaboom. K\\, whatever.\\n\\nSo the fuel situation is critical on the Mon Calamari Cruiser. Other ships that were with it run out of fuel and are destroyed when they come into weapons range of the flagship. There were originally three ships\\, including a medical frigate and some other capital ship\\, in their group... but everyone had to pile onto the Cruiser instead of splitting up and sending the individual ships into 3 different directions\\, which brings up further questions about their ability to track the ships in hyperspace. How are they tracking them? Why couldn't they take their 33% chance of survival and run away from everyone else? Sure\\, the First Order would likely split its fleet and pursue each ship\\, but at least they'd have tried something other than crawling through space at a snail's pace for 18 HOURS. Fine\\, don't split the party... until the transports are dispatched as 30 ships peel off to make for the planet. But the First Order are still following the Cruiser. What? They don't see the other ships at all? Not even long-range sensors? Or looking out a friggin' window?! Nope\\, it comes as a complete surprise to them that the Rebelsistance is splitting up. So\\, naturally\\, the First Order starts firing on the transports when they realize what's up\\, and suddenly all the transports are in range of their cannons and are easily picked off one by one. Uh\\, oops! Then Admiral Laura Dern at the helm of the Cruiser decides to turn the ship around and use it to hyperdrive into the flagship. Apparently\\, the First Order didn't see ANY OF THIS HAPPENING because the Cruiser is able to completely come about (a slow and arduous process during which time it would no longer be maintaining distance from the First Order fleet and would be a sitting duck for target practice). But no\\, we have to have a cool resolution to make Admiral Laura Dern a hero\\, so they naturally don't use any of their other myriad guns to take out the Cruiser first and she warps right into them. Cool visuals\\, but utterly baffling and stupid.\\n\\nIn the chaos\\, Finn and Rose (still on the flagship) manage to escape... but not before killing Captain Phasma like a bitch. Sigh. Gwendoline Christie deserved SO MUCH MORE. She's an amazing fighter in Game of Thrones\\, but here\\, she's absolutely ineffective and dies by falling down a hole into fire. Blah.\\n\\nRey escapes off-screen. Ren takes command of what's left. They pursue the Rebelsistance to the base.\\n\\nThe Rebelsistance gets into the base but it's a dead end: one way in\\, one way out. The First Order assaults the base very very slowly with a battering ram cannon. That's literally what they call it. \\\"Death Star tech\\,\\\" allegedly. So the Rebelsistance decides to counterattack with the most rickety and roughshod speeders ever - to the point that Poe Dameron puts his foot through the floorboard of one as he's driving it. Air support is sent in by the First Order to wisely take out any opposition\\, but they are *all* sent after the Falcon that sweeps in out of nowhere but now with Rey on board as well. How the hell did she get BACK on the Falcon? Never explained. And the First Order's cannon is so deadly and powerful that while it's firing up and its energy beam is enough to melt the guns on Finn's speeder but not actually cause the barely-held-together pile of crap to explode. See\\, he decides that the only way to take it out is to drive straight into it in a suicide run. He's driving THROUGH THE BEAM THE ENTIRE WAY\\, but his speeder isn't really harmed by it\\, save for the aforementioned guns melting. Yeah. Anyway\\, he's sideswiped by Rose in a desperate attempt to keep any major characters from dying heroically (or stupidly by being annihilated halfway toward the cannon by driving in its direct line of fire)... and he pulls her out of the speeder\\, loads her on a skid\\, and drags her back to the base door IN FULL VIEW OF A DOZEN AT-ATs AND KYLO REN'S SHUTTLE. Nobody sees\\, nobody fires at them. Amazing.\\n\\nThe Falcon\\, pursued by the TIE figthers\\, flies down some canyon like in Empire Strikes Back to shake them off. How did they know that canyon was there\\, much less that they could maneuver inside it or that it was big enough for the Falcon to make it through at all?! Screw it; it's just another excuse for another podracer sequence to make a video game out of\\, logic be damned.\\n\\nAll hope is seemingly lost\\, but then one man emerges from the Rebelsistance base: Luke. Ren wisely orders artillery to unload on Luke\\, and after a minute or two\\, they stop... and he's still standing. Great moment! Then they fight one-on-one; Ren tries to kill him\\, but his saber is ineffective because Luke never left his sanctuary world and is projecting into Ren's mind. Interesting stuff! Then Luke vanishes\\, becoming one with the Force. LAME! WEAK! BOO! HISS! WHAT THE HELL FOR?! The Rebelsistance finds a way out through the back door they said didn't exist about 10 minutes ago (MAGIC!) and that's your lot. Roll credits\\, wait two more years for JJ Abrams to fuck it up even worse... though now that we see what a total clusterfuck this movie was\\, it'll be a tall order to make a less logical movie from here. Just atrocious. Does anybody actually read these scripts before they put them into production anymore? Doesn't anyone ask questions about the story and how stupidly these plots unfold?\\n\\nIn short\\, go for the visuals and Mark Hamill\\, but turn your brain off for everything else. If you think about any part of the story or plot for more than five seconds\\, you'll give yourself an aneurysm.","true":true}
