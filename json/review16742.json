Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In many ways while I was watching the Last Jedi but the after taste is seriously bad. Its like this movie was done by people who don't know the Star wars universe and couldn't care less about the world and the characters from the old movies. They also don't seem to know how to write believable characters so it feels like the franchise is now officially dead. It's a beauty to watch but painful to digest.","true":true}
