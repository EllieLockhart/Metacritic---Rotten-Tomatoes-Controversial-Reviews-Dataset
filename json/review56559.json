{"101487":175130,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi is a big missed opportunity. Everything jj abrams has set up in the force awakens has been completely thrown out of the window in the last jedi. Every question that has been answerd in the last jedi\\, are unsatisfying and disappointing. New characters are thrown away and lack any character development. The story contains of unnecessary story lines that does not further the plot. There are a lot of plot holes in the movie and it shows how much attention it lacks from the director. This film is beautiful to look at and its very well acted\\, but a pretty picture cant safe an entire movie. Disney is pushing for something different and unique without understanding the hart of the star wars saga. Ryan Johnson is Sacrificing characters and the story for plot twists and surprises that does not help to further the plot as a whole. The last jedi had a lot of opportunities and it pains me to see what they ended up with. The last jedi is a mess and Ryan Johnson will give JJ Abrams a hard time continuing the story for episode 9.","true":true}
