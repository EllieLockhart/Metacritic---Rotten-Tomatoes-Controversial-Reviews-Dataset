Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Too scared to take itself seriously without cutting to jokes. All the scenes with the new girl are prequel esque and ruined the pace. Finn is still a joke character just like phasma. The director tried to be clever about how he handled the things JJ setup but what he didn't realise is that this movie felt like 3 hours\\, this is already the second movie\\, it felt like nothing really happened\\, and he showed his cards too early in the film. It still doesn't feel like the old characters have passed the torch to the new ones. They talk about letting go of the past yet here we are copying empire and return of the jedi. Anything that was original felt like it was from the prequels. I love Kylo Ren\/Adam Driver in this but they did not handle Han Solo's departure or Luke\/Leia's Character well at all. I will never Blame any of the original cast\/crew to saying yes\\, I'm glad to see you guys back on the big screen\\, I don't leave this review with hate\\, just disappointment in how they treated you. It's ok to move on do something different\\, just do it with some heart and confidence in yourself.","true":true}
