Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointing. Solid step down from Force Awakens. Unsatisfying character development from FA; new characters are terrible; humor is forced and bad\\, drifts into prequel level moments and storylines\\, terrible pacing; some good moments and ideas squandered. Depressing.","true":true}
