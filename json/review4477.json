Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Character assisinations\\, weird flat jokes\\, and dubious plot choices everywhere - giving this 2 stars purely because the acting was great so kudos to the actors for trying there best to uphold this Mess. Whole thing plays out like it was planned on a napkin\\, with no thought for past Star Wars canon or what would make sense following The Force Awakens. Save yourself the money on this one.","true":true}
