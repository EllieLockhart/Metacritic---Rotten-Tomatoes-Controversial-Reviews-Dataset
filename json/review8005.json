Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fail! Our questions of who Snoke and Rey are goes unanswered in this disappointing Hollywood\\, Disney\\, 21st century agenda pushing crap shoot. It's like Rian Johnson through out JJ's The Force Awakens plot and said \\\"Hey Micheal Bay\\, Wanna come over to my house and help me write a movie I'm working\\, I'm calling it Star Wars\\, my mom says you can spend the night if it's ok with your Mom and we blow stuff up in the backyard?\\\".
