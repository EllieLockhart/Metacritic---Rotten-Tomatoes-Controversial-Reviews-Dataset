Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A movie without soul\\,  it's a movie trying to cut the strings attached with the past\\, but gives nothing new\\, anything changes from the previous movie. The two main plots were useless and added nothing\\, you will be able to see the episode 9 without seeing this one.","true":true}
