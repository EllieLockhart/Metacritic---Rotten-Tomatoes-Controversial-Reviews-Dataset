Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, I was pretty disappointed in The Last Jedi.  Don't get me wrong\\, there were really great parts.  The themes about the force were good\\, the ending was really good.  As a whole\\, the movie wasn't great.  The first half of the movie was paced very awkwardly. There were way too many Marvel-like comic relief moments.  The Finn\/Rose subplot was hardly conducive to the story and actually pretty distracting.  Too many forced supporting characters that we don't care or know enough about.  It felt like they stepped slightly outside the lines of the Star Wars Universe at times.  All of this negative stuff being said\\, I did enjoy the movie and was entertained.  However I left the theater disappointed\\, because I know there was a lot more potential.","true":true}
