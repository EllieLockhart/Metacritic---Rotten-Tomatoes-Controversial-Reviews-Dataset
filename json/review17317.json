Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I recall leaving the movie feeling\\, well\\, nothing. It took me a rewatch to realize that I wouldn't ever want to see it again. I appreciated the attempt to do something different with Star Wars by playing around with the themes and commenting on the black and white morality inimical to Star Wars. Yet\\, there was so much that didn't make sense\\, be it Luke Skywalker's unclear motivations and character twist to suddenly killing off the main villain whose role was never really clarified anyway\\, that it hindered enjoyment. Again\\, I was with the movie's characterization of Kylo Ren and could accept\\, not love\\, Rey as an archetype who doesn't necessarily need to be relatable in all respects. Not every character needs to be relatable and if we did need such a character\\, it was probably Finn. But the attempts to subvert expectations\\, portraying Kylo as not all that evil and the light AND dark side as important to maintaining balance\\, were seemingly thrown away at movie's end. It comes back to a typical story arch and tries to replicate the joy of Return of the Jedi's ending as if the previous thirty minutes of defeat had not occurred. I could go into the others flaws in the film but\\, to be honest\\, even after listing all of them\\, on its own this movie would probably get at least two-three stars. Why am I rating it so low? Because it's a Star Wars movie. The biggest fear of the franchise being bought out by an impersonal corporation\\, albeit one typically attuned to youth culture\\, was that films would be put out with little concern for its origins and for what could be added to the world to make it more endearing to a new generation. Children didn't need to insert themselves into a figure randomly-imbued with force powers. They wanted heroes they could aspire to be and the shoe-horning of Finn\\, the previous film's most relatable character\\, was a mistake. Moreover\\, the fear was that a company lacking the creator of the series would be content to co-opt the franchise for their own purposes\\, disregarding original intent in favor of using a recognizable media as a vessel to further an elaborate money-grab. To be fair\\, this probably isn't Rian Johnson's fault. Were he making his own science fiction series\\, even as an homage\/critique of Star Wars\\, that I would ultimately accept and rate higher. Because it\\, like original Star Wars\\, it would be an original contribution to the world of science fiction\\, rather than a disorganized attempt to pack the 2017 holiday movie season and sell toys. Even if that was partly Lucas' attempt from the beginning\\, he did understand the strategy to creating a new story or\\, at least\\, creating something that furthered the time-honored mission of storytelling\\, rather than putting wish-fulfillment and inappropriate comedy at the fore.","true":true}
