Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Instead of character development and solid story we're treated with a movie that looks like an uncut\\, waaaaay too long version made up from random and badly thought pointless scenes\\, cheap\\, hollow laughs\\, Leia floating like Mary Poppins\\, Luke killed for no reason whatsoever\\, spaceships \\\"running out of fuel\\\"\\, bombing in space WWII -style\\, dumb\\, just dumb writing.\\nSnoke\\, the supervillain\\, killed like a cheap extra...\\nOh\\, wait\\, instead of an awesome final fight\\, a hologram? Why\\, just why?\\n\\nFor sure\\, I'm not going to see another one.\\n\\n* On the bright side\\, the prequels are not the worst of Star Wars anymore!\\n** This isn't a bad Star Wars movie\\, it's a bad movie\\, the kind of CGI-heavy mindless\\, soulless\\, watch-and -forget movie.","true":true}
