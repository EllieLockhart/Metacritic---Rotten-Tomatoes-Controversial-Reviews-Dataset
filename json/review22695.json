Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like several others I created my Rotten Tomatoes account just to review Star Wars.  So many others have described well why this movie is terrible so I'm not going to waste my time and repeat.  Just briefly as a movie it's ok but as a Star Wars movie it's terrible.  It's more like just another comic book movie with Star Wars characters thrown in.  I doubt I'll bother seeing any future Star Wars movies on the big screen.","true":true}
