Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"honestly for me it was an okay movie. they left a lot of questions about the movie and the questions they did answer i didn't feel satisfied my curiosity. I'm also not the biggest fan that they are kind of copying a lot from the original 4\\,5\\,6.","true":true}
