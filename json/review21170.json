Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very entertained and I saw the people around me in the theater with wide-eyes and grins at all the right moments. I\u2019m not sure what is considered a reasonable expectation for a film amongst its more vocal critics. While a fan of the genre and Star Wars in general I don\u2019t care about canon or expect any film to be be something specific. What it has continued to do is get me to care about the characters\\, where they\u2019ve been and where they are going. Most films have their weak spots and The Last Jedi is no exception\\, but the good outweighed the bad. It was well worth my time in the theater and I will definitely be coming back for the next installment of the saga. ","true":true}
