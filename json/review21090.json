Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was SO disappointed with this MOVIE. It didn't make sense. Why the hell did they bring Yoda in? And Snoke! They didn't even explain who he was or why he was that way. And KylO and Rey\\, there relationship was too different from the last movie. The director could have done so much better with their story. They ruined Kylo and REY. I'm confused about the plot of the movie. Where does it go from here?","true":true}
