Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is clear to me that Disney is more concerned about ticket sales then putting together a great new take on star wars. It is basically the old movies remade\\, with new cheesy characters and better special effects (who cares). I have loved star wars since I was 5 years old and it is sad that these movies tie into those. This trilogy is a clown act.  Laughably bad.","true":true}
