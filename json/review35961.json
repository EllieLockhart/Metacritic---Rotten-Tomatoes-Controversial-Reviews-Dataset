{"101487":175584,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi may be a well-made movie\\, but it's not a good Star Wars movie.  With maybe one exception (Kylo's fall and Luke's exile)\\, it doesn't answer any of the compelling questions from The Force Awakens in any satisfying way.  In fact\\, it actually hurts that film and its wonderful setup of its characters by giving us off-putting answers to the question of Rey's parents\\, as well as refusing to adequately develop characters such as Finn.  Rian was clearly interested in Kylo above all else--with the other characters (especially Rey) getting short shrift.  At this point\\, it seems Lucasfilm has no overarching plan for this trilogy.  If Rey is not a Solo or Skywalker\\, and if this is the Kylo Ren show\\, then why should fans care about Episode IX?  Return of the Jedi was great because of the emotional stakes involved in Luke trying to redeem his father and his brotherly concern for Leia.  Where are the emotional stakes in Rey Random?  There aren't any.  And having her fall in love with Kylo is a slap in the face to female fans\\, considering how manipulative\\, abusive\\, and downright evil Kylo is\\, even at the end of this film.  I prefer the old EU at this point.  Lucasfilm\/Disney have a real mess on their hands.","true":true}
