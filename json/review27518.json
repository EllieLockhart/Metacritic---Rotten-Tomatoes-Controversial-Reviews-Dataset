Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I thought it was enjoyable but not amazing! There are a few scenes which look ridiculous and wild \u201ceven for Star Wars\u201d which let the film down. Plot doesn\u2019t really go in any direction and the special effects were very CGI heavy which was disappointing. ","true":true}
