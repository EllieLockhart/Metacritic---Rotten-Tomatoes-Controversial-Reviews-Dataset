Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to begin this review by saying I am not a bit\\, or a troll\\, or part of some Facebook Star Wars fan page trying to Sabatoge this movie. I also will not go into a long winded explanation for my hatred of this movi  because many seem to have already done this. All I will say is that this movie single handedled ruined Star Wars. It took a wonderful foundation (TFA) and then said \\\"no ok none of this matters\\\" in TLJ. I get trying to be original\\, but why at the expense of just doing it to do it? The best way I could use to describe this new trilogy is TFA felt the beginning of a wonderful relationship. TLJ felt like a nice date with some great moments\\, but not sure where it's gonna go. Fuck Disney\\, fuck rain Johnson\\, and fuck whoever thought this was a good idea. Also\\, for good measure\\, fuck all the people who think this movies negative fan response is simply because of bots or trolls cause that couldn't be farther from the truth. Let the line of thought die\\, kill it if you have to","true":true}
