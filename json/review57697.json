Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ugh\\, this movie sucked. only thing going for it\\, is that it didn't suck as much at the previous. WTF why chase ships down in SPACE when you have lightspeed. WTF new order forgot they had hyperspace capability and not short on fuel? and FUEL?!! since when has that been an issue in any star wars movie or book or series? STUPID. Snoke gets built up as a immensly poweful being and then get killed like a punk newb. Rey should\/has powerful ancestors? newp\\, just a bunch of crack heads. Luke also wasted. Alliance\/rebellion high command... smoked for no reason. Alliance\/rebellion... billions of planets in their galaxy and they're down to 4 ships...err\\, 0?!!! War crime even greater than a deathstar (using lightspeed as a weapon) and that's ok? mmm what is this? salt? ??!!!!! oh maybe trying to make sure we didnt think the white stuff was snow? \/facepalm. STUPID. only thing this movie had for it was the tension build-up w\/the skype messages between Rey and Kylo and then that was ruined. Thing is Disney will make retarded $$ from this movie and say Fkit. made fortune = nothing wrong and Fk the fans; retarded suckers.","true":true}
