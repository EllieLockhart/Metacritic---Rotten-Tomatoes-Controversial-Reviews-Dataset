Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"GEORGE LUCAS'S SPIRIT IS ABSENT IN THE FORCE AWAKENS AND IN THE LAST JEDI. THESE MOVIES HAVE THE FEEL OF KIDS BEING SET LOOSE IN GEORGE'S PROP WAREHOUSE. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE FULL ACCESS TO ALL OF HIS TOYS\\, THEY LACK GEORGE'S CREATIVE IMAGINATION. THE CLOSEST ANYONE AT DISNEY HAS COME TO GEORGE'S IMAGINATION AND SPIRIT IS FOUND IN DAVE FILONI. THE ONLY HOPE NOW IS IF DISNEY COMBINES THE CREATIVE IMAGINATION OF DAVE FILIONI WITH THAT OF THE WRITERS OF GAME OF THRONES.","true":true}
