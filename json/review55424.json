{"101487":153017,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MARK HAMILL\\, I AM SO\\, SO\\, SO\\, SORRY THEY DID THIS TO YOU.    \\n\\n(Reposting my review because 1\/2 a star rating is not included in the audience score.)\\n\\nThis is the first time I have ever posted on Rotten Tomatoes\\, I created an account solely because of this Abomination of a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nI cannot believe that I am saying this\\, but\\, THE LAST JEDI is worse than THE PHANTOM MENACE. I never thought I would say that about another Star Wars Movie. I rather watch Godfather III 100 times.  What a big slap in the face to the Star War Fans.  \\n\\nThis movie has a total disrespect for the original characters. But even if none of the original cast were in this movie\\, it is still a terrible story with ridiculous plot holes. \\n\\nThey push a ridiculous progressive political message. All the women are leaders and strong\\, all the men are either evil\\, stupid\\, or weak. \\n\\nThere is absolutely no way so many professional critics loved this movie. The critics giving great reviews are obviously Progressives as well and\/or terrified of Disney.  \\n\\nAnd I have to really question the \\\"authenticity\\\" of the \\\"Audience Reviews\\\" that give 4-5 stars. Their \\\"written reviews\\\" are so vague\\, and non-specific\\, that even if they write a paragraph\\, they do not offer any substance or level of detail to their \\\"cough\\\"\\, opinion.\\n\\nI must assume that Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have always secretly hated\\, or were jealous of the success\/story of the Star Wars Franchise and wanted to destroy the series and George Lucas' dream.","true":true}
