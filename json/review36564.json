Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had so many failings it's hard to describe them all. Hated what they did with Luke Skywalker\\, hated Finn and Rose's plotline. They didn't do justice to Snoke. The only part that appealed to me was the interplay between Rey and Kylo. Overall I think the movie had a lot of potential but blew it all.","true":true}
