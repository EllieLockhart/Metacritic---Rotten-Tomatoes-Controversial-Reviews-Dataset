Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has a few structural issues\\, but still the most thrilling\\, thoroughly entertaining Star Wars movie I've seen in a long\\, long time. I had basically given up on being surprised by this franchise after the prequels thudded onto the scene\\, but The Last Jedi proved there is still some spark left in this lumbering cash-cow\\, after all.","true":true}
