{"101487":142599,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's been well over 20 years since I first experienced the grandeur of George Lucas' Star Wars\\, yet hearing that familiar overture still gives me the chills. Continuing on in what is to be the second to last of the Skywalker Saga\\, Rian Johnson takes on the insurmountable task of appeasing the fans. If there was one criticism of \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" it was the overwhelming similarities it possessed with \\\"A New Hope.\\\" Taking cue\\, Johnson deliberately breaks the mold\\, but it's a decision that's rather divisive in nature. While some may argue that \\\"Last Jedi\\\" is a weak link in the canon\\, it just proves that fans are wary of change. The main issue seems to lie in the attachment to these characters\\, especially to the originals who have sparked a renewed interest. As standards run incredibly high\\, the film has no chance but to fall short of expectations. Is it the best since \\\"The Empire Strikes Back?\\\" Probably not. But there are still redeeming qualities that make this a respectable entry. The music\\, for one\\, is a return to familiarity - a mix of nostalgia and excitement that only John Williams can offer. Mark Hamill gets grittier in his portrayal of Luke Skywalker\\, delivering a stoic yet seasoned performance. The late Carrie Fisher takes a final bow as one of the most beloved characters to emerge from the series. Though her presence is bittersweet and left open-ended\\, one can't help but wonder what could've been in the climactic finale. The rest of the cast is rounded out by the returning members from \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" with the addition of Kelly Marie Tran as an ambitious engineer. If there's one thing I appreciate about this updated Star Wars universe\\, it's the diversity it brings to characters both big and small. The increase in humor\\, however\\, seems off for the series\\, which is usually expressed in minimal doses. At times it would feel forced and longwinded\\, causing moments of bemusement and disconnect. In addition\\, some of the characters don't feel fully fleshed out\\, or given trivial storylines to fill in the gaps. Still\\, there is a good amount of surprise to be held\\, albeit different from what many have theorized and speculated. The mysteries surrounding Rey and Kylo Ren are considerably unraveled\\, but as to how much of it is true is yet to be determined. With J.J. Abrams coming back for Episode 9\\, it should be interesting to see how this trilogy concludes. After years of ostracizing those questionable prequels\\, it will be gratifying to bid farewell in a more reputable manner.\\n\\nhttps:\/\/cinemadex.blogspot.com\/2017\/12\/star-wars-last-jedi.html","true":true}
