Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching TROS this movie now makes greater sense to me and provides a change of style within the sequel trilogy. All the subversion is still hard to endure\\, self-defeated Luke is still hard to process\\, the tossing of the lightsaber is insulting and the subplot to Canto is boring. Some of this is Disneys fault with not allowing Johnson to keep a good bit of material in the movie and cutting it for run time. This is evident when you watch the deleted scenes which are excellent. With that said the island training  scenes with Rey and Luke are great\\, the dynamic and interactions between Rey and Kylo are interesting and seeing Yoda appear to guide Luke one final time is worth the watch in itself.","true":true}
