Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was never more disappointed in a movie in my entire life than this one. It ruins all the good The Force Awakens did to set up the franchise in every way possible. Every plot point is meaningless or just downright awful. One specific part of the movie is something that previous films have said it definitely can't happen because it'll make you think \\\"Hey\\, every battle could've been avoided if they just did this? But didn't it say in the prequels and in Empire that it's impossible to do this?\\\" Huge disappointment and truly sad that this was Carrie Fisher's send-off.","true":true}
