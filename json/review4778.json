Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ruined the Star Wars franchise.  Made a Rotten Tomato's account just to state how horrible this film is.  TFA had a lot of problems and was not great but it at least left the potential for a lot of good things to come.  TLJ completely destroys any interest I had in this new trilogy.  I don't care about any of the characters & probably will not watch the final film.  Mark Hamill tried to warn us and he was absolutely right.  Abysmal writing and world\/character development.  What they did with Luke especially was not even believable.","true":true}
