Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely worth the watch! Amazing visuals\\, great acting\\, amazing plot. The list could good on. I love what the director did with this movie\\, he filled in the gabs for what the other star wars films needed. Such as: the red guards. They don't just stand there now. Luke Skywalker not standing on a cliff. \\n\\nThe fight scenes are phenomenal. Luke Ren has an extremely satisfying fight form now. He isn't just gets punch bag. \\n\\nAll in all. Star wars the last jedi isn't just a film. It's a movement. This has me excited for the years too come. Hopefully one day I will be able to directed a star wars film. This film has inspired me to do so!","true":true}
