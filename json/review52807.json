Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Rose felt tackled on\\, the jokes were out of place\\, and Luke's character plot is bad. really bad.","true":true}
