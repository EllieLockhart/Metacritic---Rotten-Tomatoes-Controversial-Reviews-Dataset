Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is messy in terms of execution and writing as the Casino subplot is the worst part of this film. It seems to distract from the other plots which one is going at a slow pace and the other is trying to develop the main characters. Many of the elements from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"  could have been built up but instead were wasted opportunities or ignored. The acting from the cast though is top notch and CGI\\, for the most part\\, was good. The use of colours and shots during fight sequences are great. The musical score by John Williams is always lovely to hear.\\nEven though there are questions that the movie brings up and doesn't answer it's not a bad movie. It does make me wonder what will happen in IX.","true":true}
