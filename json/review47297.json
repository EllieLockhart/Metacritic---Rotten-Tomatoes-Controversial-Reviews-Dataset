Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a thrill ride! I plan on seeing this at least three more times in theatre. So many details I missed\\, so many things I want to see again! I only wish Rian would do Episode 9 as well.","true":true}
