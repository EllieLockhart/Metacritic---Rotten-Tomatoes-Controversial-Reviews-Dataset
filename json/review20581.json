Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never left a review on RT before\\, but I was compelled to sign up to leave this review. This movie was a slap in the face to anyone who grew up loving Star Wars. I found myself rolling my eyes on many different occasions and would have left the movie early had I not been with a group. What a waste!","true":true}
