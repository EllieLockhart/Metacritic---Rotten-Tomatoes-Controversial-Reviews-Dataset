Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A couple humorous lines\\, a sweetly emotional reunion\\, bringing back a certain beloved character for one scene\\, and beautiful cinematography  Doesn't save\\, \\\" The Last Jedi\\\" from being one of the most disappointing entries in the Star Wars Universe for many people. While the film had issues\\, most could have been overlooked were it not for the 34 years of expectation resting on the shoulders of Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill absolutely shined brightly while reprising his role as the man who once defeated the empire by redeeming his father. However\\, while Hamill's acting is absolutely fantastic in this film\\, Rian Johnson's treatment of the character gave us a Luke Skywalker we never expected but also never permanently wanted. The most egregious sin of all being that after 34 years of expectation there is zero pay off. This was done in a way that seemed underhanded and hollow. Rian Johnson used slight of hand to make you think at first you were about to see what you've wanted to see since the end of Return of the Jedi\\, but then pulls the rug out from under audiences in a grand trick. When the dust settles\\, you ask yourself Why did I just watch this? Instead the film takes story-lines that were setup well enough by JJ Abrams\\, regardless of whether you loved or hated them\\, and trashed them all in a way that makes you wonder\\, okay\\, now why should I care about any of this any more? Going forward Johnson has gutted the franchise by making it clear that Star Wars will no longer be about the Skywalker family\\, but isn't that the core of what makes Star Wars saga films what they are? I think the fan in me was run through with a light saber by Johnson's \\\"twists\\\"\\, and I don't think even the force of JJ Abram's next film can bring that fan back to life. After the not needed Solo film\\, Episode IX may well be the second Star Wars film I skip going to the theater for.","true":true}
