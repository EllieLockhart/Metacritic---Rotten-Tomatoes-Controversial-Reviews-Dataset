Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave it 1\/2 becoz the movie has great visuals\\,sound and action.Unfortunately that's about it.As someone who grew with SW\\,it is not just a movie\\,its has become part of our culture with a very special place in my heart.The filmmakers clearly destroyed it by including hidden agendas and insulting the main characters and the whole arc.Not to mention bizarre storyline with idiotic subplot.I understand the whole new gen\\,girl power move on thing.But by not giving the proper burial to the legendary characters\\,I'm afraid the Jedi ghost of the past will haunt us forever.","true":true}
