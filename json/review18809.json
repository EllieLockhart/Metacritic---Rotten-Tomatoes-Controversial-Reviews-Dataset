Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a major disappointment. Hammil is great. Driver and Ridley have sexual chemistry that is wasted. The plot is bloated and full of holes. Bottom line is Mickey Mouse paid off critics. You would have to be drunk to think this was a good Star Wars film. The acting is better than the prequels and there are some great shots\\, but in the end as much as I hated the prequels\\, on retrospect the storytelling was superior. Revenge of the Sith\\, even despite wooden acting from lead\\, is a better film than Last Jedi and that is sad. It is sad because somewhere in this film is the poignant vision of the downfall of a legend\\, but it gets buried by bad screenwriting\\, bad editing (absurdly long film) and inconsistent directing. Hammil is no Pacino or Ford and somehow director brings his game up to the point he steals the show\\, but Finn and company\u2019s side plot is laughably bad. This needed a rewrite and a redirect. They did a lot of reshoots on Rogue One which is the best Star Wars film since the Original Trilogy. Last Jedi needed some reshoots as well.","true":true}
