Yes it doesn't have bad mechanics\\, the graphics are great\\, and if the plot were an original IP maybe it wouldn't deserve a score of a 1. So why does it get a 1?

Although I will not spoil the plot for those that still wish to play it\\, I invite you to check out the spoilers and not pay $60 to a company that actively hates it's fan base and cannot write a good story. There was so much potential here\\, but they seem to be more interested in making the fans hate the characters in the first game and using heavy handed manipulation tactics to do so. The first game was so well written\\, but this game uses every cheap trick in the book to get it's message across. And no matter what anyone tells you\\,  almost no one is upset by the use of LGBT characters\\, Ellie's DLC for the first game is where we found out she was gay and everyone still loved her\\, and everyone still loves her. Abby is only hated because she's a flat character with no personality and commits one of the most disgusting acts of cowardly violence in video game history and they expect you to empathize with her because \\\"she's human\\\" Everyone is human\\, I think Naughty Dog doesn't give their fan base enough credit for their intelligence. I find it hard to believe any of the critical reviewers who called this a 10\/10 didn't receive some sort of compensation for their scores. Truly disgusting and horribly written story. Do not purchase if you enjoyed the first game. Changed the score to 3 because Metacritic wouldn't allow me to give it a 1\\, but trust me it's a 1.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
