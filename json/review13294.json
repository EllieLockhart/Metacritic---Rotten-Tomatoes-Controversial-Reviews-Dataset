Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't why people hate this film. It was a great film with good twists that surprised me a lot. It was a bit too long\\, but overall\\, the movie was great and makes you feel a lot of emotions. True Star Wars will love it!","true":true}
