Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I saw Star Wars was at a drive-in movie theater back in the late 70s and it was the best movie of all time. Then came Empire strikes back which was really really good. Fast forward to 2010s. Star Wars force awakens was awesome good movie then I think even better was rogue one a Star Wars story. But this last one I went to go see today was it an abomination for the Star Wars galaxy. Rain Johnson should never ever be hired as a director writer he is horrible he made the worst Star Wars movie of all time even beat out phantom menace. If you\u2019re a true Star Wars fan you will not be happy with the direction of this movie horrible horrible movie. I hate to say but the justice league movie was better in this crappy rain Johnson movie.","true":true}
