Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is going to be extremely polarising. Some fans will be on board with the film's choices and some will be fuming. I still managed to enjoy a lot of what this film has to offer\\, though it certainly has flaws.","true":true}
