Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what I just saw. It was as if everything was just average or below. Nothing terrible and nothing great. Wasted opportunity on almost every front. If Rian Johnson wanted to scrap JJs ideas from TFA\\, I wished this would have happened in another trilogy. Let\u2019s all be honest\\, Luke was not handled well and wasn\u2019t believable as a uninspiring coward. ","true":true}
