Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like hobbit era peter Jackson and the writers of the tv show \\\"friends\\\" teamed up to make a soulless\\, heartless\\, super hero movie attempt at a Star Wars film that was acted out by androids.  \\n\\nTruly the most disappointed I have ever walked out of a theatre.","true":true}
