Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some plot lines that were turned on their side\\, and some people won't love that\\, but I did. I respected it so much for doing something different with so much of this. Great performances and great overall story. The fact that the Fore is sort of redefined here in a sense will bother some\\, but this is a grand source of energy\\, a mystical religion\/way of life...you don't get to decide exactly how it works. Sorry. Rose is great\\, and I really enjoyed her as an addition. Rey and Luke and Leia are spectacular. Kylo Ren is hugely improved here. So a flawed film\\, but very good.","true":true}
