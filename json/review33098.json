Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subversive\\, thoughtful\\, and most of all\\, surprising. The film is fresh\\, socially relevant and exciting\\, but not without flaws. The film suffers from pacing issues and the occasional confusing character beat\\, but as a complete piece of cinema\\, it is an artist's singular vision. Rian Johnson made the movie he wanted to. This is what happens when you give a true artist a big budget - the result is often a mess\\, but it is a mess that is full of emotion\\, hope and pure cinematic flare. Star Wars is fresh again. The universe is blown wide open and I can't wait to see what happens next. Well done\\, Rian Johnson.","true":true}
