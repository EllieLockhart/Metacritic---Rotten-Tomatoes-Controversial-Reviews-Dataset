Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really did not enjoy this movie. Rain Johnson completely ruined Luke Skywalker. I waited 20+ years since my first viewing RotJ imagining how amazing Luke would as a Jedi Master. Huge letdown. Not to mention Rey is 100% a Mary Sue\\, mainly due to the poor development of the character. Three lessons in and she's moving mountains of boulders. Vice Admiral whoever was a complete throw away character. This movie had zero depth. Poor writing poor storytelling. I think Disney's ruining the franchise.","true":true}
