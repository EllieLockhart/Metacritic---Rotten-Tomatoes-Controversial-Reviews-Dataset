Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deardful. Star wars in ruined. The force is cheapened. Most of the characters are useless\/have no roles. So many plot holes. Terrible writing. Instead of trying to write a good story\\, Disney has chosen to spread the SJW and feminist agenda. RIP star wars. It ended at ep 6 for me.","true":true}
