{"101487":110024,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than the previous entry but still uneven. The Star Wars saga\\, mainly episodes 4-6\\, lived and thrived from the heroe's journey and Joseph Campbell. It was the rise of a young man to become a hero and face his destiny\\, adding a family twist to the mix that was unexpected. This\\, combined with humour\\, a fantasy world and a well-thought of mix of diverse characters which interacted like a family made this series so lovable. \\nEpisodes 1-3 tried to turn it around: the rise of the evil\\, unfortunately\\, that did not work\\, due a very weak first entry with a boy with whom identification was difficult to say the least. Thus\\, while the story was told\\, it didn't have a heart and it never had a family at its core (at least one that was believable and relatable.) The twist - unfortunately - wore thin too\\nNow with episodes 7-9 there was a chance to do it all over again. And again\\, they focus on the rise of evil (which\\, guess what\\, episodes 10-12 will master again...) And still they are not getting it right.\\nThe problem is - yet again - the evil side. Kylo Ren is a youth who cannot serve as a template for all frustrations (he's just too imbalanced) nor for hate (he's just too weak). He killed Han\\, to become ... the same weak character he was before. He is faced with evil... which is easily killed. He meets his sister (surprise\\, anyone? Or is it Luke's daughter?) and turns to the dark side... but yet... not quite. Sigh.\\nThe problem with episodes 7 and 8 is... we've seen it before. The structural elements remain intact. There are so few surprises (Porks being eaten was the best one). You just sit there\\, thinking: Yep\\, I know what's coming. So where are the surprises? The problem lies in the identification. If they were to turn Rey into an evil one\\, that would indeed be a surprise\\, but at the core is always a brother-sister father-son story and that is... repetitive in a way. And it is boring. Episodes 7-9 seem to just turn things around\\\". Male > Female\\, Father > brother\\, Luke > Rey. Yes\\, I get it\\, this is the female Star Wars\\, fine by me. But make it more interesting. Real twists.\\nLeia was supposed to train Rey\\, Fisher's death will shake things up. While I will miss her dearly\\, she was a wonderful woman and actress\\, this may give episode 9 the chance not to repeat the Ben-Kenobi > Leia sequence\\, but\\, alas\\, it wil probably just be Luke training Rey instead of Leia. I love Star Wars\\, but hey\\, there are so many stories to tell\\, why keep telling the same story over and over again? Mirroing just doesn't count.","true":true}
