Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had no narrative\\, and the events that take place in it are out of context in the Star Wars universe.  The tone was off (War movie but lots of jokes)\\, which killed any suspense.  Weirdly\\, it seemed to be trying to insult fans (ex: \\\"Take that stupid mask off\\,\\\" \\\"Did you expect me to come out with my Laser Sword\\\").  Sad\\, really.","true":true}
