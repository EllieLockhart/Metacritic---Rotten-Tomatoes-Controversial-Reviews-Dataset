Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so much potential and fell so short there were so many things that made 0 sense and the whole movie revolves around the First Order Chasing the rebels through space in the same system. Luke throwing the light saber rey gave him over his head off the cliff is exactly how i felt they took this films potential and tossed it. It felt like to me that the movie was one huge joke and the person who made it knows nothing about star wars or simply does not care.","true":true}
