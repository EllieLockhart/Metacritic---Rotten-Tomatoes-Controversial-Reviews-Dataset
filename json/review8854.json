Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For reasons that can be found all over the internet\\, this movie is an abomination. The \\\"jokes\\\"\\, the character \\\"development\\\" of Luke\\, the idiocy of the character Rose etc. The list just goes on and on.\\n\\nIf you've already watched this movie (and disliked it)\\, don't watch the next.\\nAnd the fact that 91% of the so called \\\"critics\\\" recommend it while only 50% (at the time of writing) of the audiance recommends it says volumes about how much trust should be given to these critics.","true":true}
