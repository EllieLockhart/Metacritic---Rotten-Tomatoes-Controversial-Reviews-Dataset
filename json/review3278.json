Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a fan since 1977.   I've seen every SW episode at least 3 times in the theaters\\, some as many as over a dozen.  I own every episode - prequels and Rogue One included on Blu Ray.  I have NO desire to see this piece of trash again in any setting.\\n\\nI will not be buying my kids toys from this movie or the next if it is as bad as this one.  This movie went so off the rails I don't know how JJ Abrams will be able to fix it in the next one.\\nI was looking forward to the next generation of of characters fromthe Force Awakens.  But they went no where in this movie and instead we got a movie full of porgs and other bad new characters that can't act.  No thanks.","true":true}
