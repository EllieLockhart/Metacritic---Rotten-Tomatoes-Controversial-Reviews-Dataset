{"101487":135498,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the Force Awakens. Familiar though the plot was\\, I felt that it was everything great about the original Star Wars updated and writ large for the 21st century. My expectations for The Last Jedi were huge\\, but I was basically expecting to see all the promises of TFA fulfilled.\\n\\n1) I wanted Kylo Ren to have at least one scene as grand and menacing as his introduction is TFA--striking down an old man in cold blood and then ordering the massacre of a whole village. \\n\\nWhat we got: Ren appears with the helmet for about 90 seconds and is parodied for it. The voice has been altered to sound weaker and more distorted\\, reducing the menace. He gets no scenes of great evil or cruelty. What looks like the build to an amazing\\, viscious confrontation with Luke turns out to be a sleight of hand. \\n\\n2) The Knights of Ren to make an appearance. I wanted that awesome scene in the rain from TFA to be fleshed out and explored here.\\n\\nWhat we got: nothing.\\n\\n3) Some kind of lightsaber duel.\\n\\nWhat we got: nothing. One lightsaber battle with the praetorian guards\\, but no one on one.\\n\\n4) A backstory for Snoke and how he influenced Ben Solo to the Dark Side.\\n\\nWhat we got: indirect verbal narrarive.\\n\\n5) More gritty scenes that portray the Stormtroopers as fearsome\\, as in the opening sequence of TFA.\\n\\nWhat we got: virtually no trooper vs anyone action. It's all star fighter battles.\\n\\n6) A darker storyline.\\n\\nWhat we got: self-parody\\, Disneyfication and half a dozen new cgi cutesy creatures.\\n\\n7) To discover the significance of Rey's lineage and possible connection to Ren.\\n\\nWhat we got: Rey's parents are nobody and she has no prior connection to Ren.\\n\\nI could go on. But essentially\\, this film failed to fulfil the promises\\, tone and set up TFA. It dispensed with the mysteries and the answers to those mysteries that would have surprised and delughted fans.\\n\\nIt's a well-shot\\, Star Wars-themed children's film. Very light-hearted. A mixture of Harry Potter\\, Twilight\\, Toy Story and Avengers. \\n\\nIt is not a weighty\\, darker sequel that adequately develops the premises and themes of TFA (although the Rey \/ Ren development has some limited merit -- ultimately comes off hackneyed and hollow\\, though). It left me and countless long term Star Wars fan bitterly disappointed\\, empty and deflated.\\n\\nThis is the only Star Wars film that has filled me with horror and disappointment as it draws to a close\\, because it had so spectacularly failed to meet expectation or grab my imagination. Its faux-depth and self-parody undermine it and feel like a slap in the face.","true":true}
