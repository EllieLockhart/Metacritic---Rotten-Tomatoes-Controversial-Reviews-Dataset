Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where are the Y-wings? This movie is inconsistent with the star wars universe and is used primarily as a platform to spew gender and identity politics. It's an entertaining movie to play for your toddler though\\, as the jokes are roughly PG-5 and the 'action' scenes are slow and riddled with these jokes. The effects are decent\\, but what can you expect from a movie made in 2017. If the story isn't good then the effects don't matter either. Disney can produce whatever they want\\, they have the rights\\, but where Star Wars truly lies is with the fans\\, and the content created there is more powerful and creative than anything Rian has added to the franchise.","true":true}
