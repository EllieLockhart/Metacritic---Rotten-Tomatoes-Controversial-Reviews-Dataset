Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie\\, poorly written\\, tons of plot holes\\, too long. Not a bad rating because of the deaths or changes in style\\, I didn't mind those...the movie was just awful.","true":true}
