Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was out of character\\, the walkers don't shoot characters who crash right in front of them\\, there were multiple plot holes\\, and the director apparently felt he didn't need to keep the story consistent with The Force Awakens. The only good thing about The Last Jedi was the visual effects.","true":true}
