Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total rubbish Luke says to Rey what do you want me to do walk out with my laser sword and face down the first order ? Well yes thats what you did in ESB and ROTJ or train Rey to do it ? is there more in that creatures milk that he was letting on and has forgotten his past? this is the Luke Skywalker he would not back down to anyone not the Emperor or Vader now he's totally different its as if they went out to destroy everything about his character from the other three films and don't get me on about princess Leia flying scene or the casino planet","true":true}
