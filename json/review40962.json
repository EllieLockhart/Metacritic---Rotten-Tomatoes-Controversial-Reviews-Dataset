Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does have a few flaws. But\\, overall I liked it. It subverts your expectations. I believe this was important if Star Wars is going to remain relevant for years to come. I liked Force Awakens\\, it quenched my nostalgia. I liked Last Jedi because it truly has me curious what they will do for a finale\\, instead of a rehash of Return of The Jedi. Also\\, it teaches one of Yoda\u2019s lessons to all characters\\, \u201cthe greatest teacher\\, failure is\u201d.","true":true}
