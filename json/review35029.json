Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first act dragged\\, and was choppy at times. The momentum of the film really kicks in after Rey trains. The final 90 minutes of this movie was the blueprint for Star Wars movies. Never a moment where you can't fist pump or laugh in that 2nd and 3rd act. Felt like 2 different movies. Wasn't disappointed AND waaaaay better than Episode 7.","true":true}
