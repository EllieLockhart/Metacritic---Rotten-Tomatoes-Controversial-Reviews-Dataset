Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally lacks a true plot\\, an insult to the entire franchise and a slap in the face to Lucas. Don\u2019t waste your money or time. This is by far the worst Star Wars Movie ever to be released since the holiday special. To say I\u2019m Disappointed is a vast understatement \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc","true":true}
