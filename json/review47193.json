Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an awful cluster. Not all that's old is gold; sometimes old stuff is just garbage. This movie starts with stupid\\, adds a dash of pure unadulterated gerrymandering (hi Yoda)\\, and ends with a promise of more punishment at the hands of Disney and its henchmen. \\nThe initial premise is from a Star Wars book\\, but executed so poorly that it took destruction of a legend and an entire fleet of bad guys to have the one saving moment of this contorted hole of a plot. Please stop giving Disney money. Don't watch this awfulness.\\nR.I.P. Carrie Fisher. Sorry it ended this way for you.","true":true}
