Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was Tuesday morning garbage. The hole plot was a dumpster fire.reasons why the hole plot was based on a low speed chase no light saber battles in the hole movie Leia can some how fly throu space Luke is not even him self felt like a completely different character no absolutely no link to force awakens they just completely set a fire any connection between the two movies what a disapointment 2 years built up to absolute garbage this director is set to do the next trilogy my god I hope they make a change I could not be more dissatisfied and i am a huge huge star wars fan this is the worst of them all I would rather watch a jar jar binks solo movie then to be forced to sit throu this movie again do not waste your money and I'm not sure what these critics where on when they watched this movie but it must be strong hopefully jj can fix the stab wound this director put in the star wars universe","true":true}
