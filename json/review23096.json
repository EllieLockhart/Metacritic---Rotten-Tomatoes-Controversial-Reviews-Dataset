Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Being an old Star Wars fan I was glad to see that this installment was true to the original story\\, yet had new characters and new twists and turns. Going to see it again today!! \ud83d\udc4d","true":true}
