Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shockingly bad\\, ruined by feminism\\, Disney's drive to sell toys and a host of new cast members who I couldn't care less for.\\nPositively\\, Mark Hamil was great and so was the returning main cast members from episode 8. What a shame about Kathleen Kennedy's influence on this film with predominately male fan base.","true":true}
