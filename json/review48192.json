Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While we watch the movie it was fun and entertaining but there were wtf moments that constantly ruin the mood. Then afterwards we silently ate our dinner processing what we just saw and reflecting on the various twists in the movie and realizing just how disappointing they were. The Force Awakens brought a new universe full of intrigue and excitement\\, then this movie crushed and ruined that same intrigue and excitement. Although not as bad as the prequel trilogy\\, it is as good and bad as the specialized editions. Much like the prequel trilogy the over abundance of silly creature and characters are unwanted and out of place\\, that combined with the out of character decisions and actions by the cast of this film make it one I do not look forward to watching again.","true":true}
