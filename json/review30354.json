Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"See it more than once. If you feel like it shattered your expectations in a strange way and bucked your assumed storylines\\, then this film achieved what it was supposed to do. Want something fimiliar? Go watch IV-VII. Something fresh\\, and well done in my opinion\\, deserves the review I'm giving it.","true":true}
