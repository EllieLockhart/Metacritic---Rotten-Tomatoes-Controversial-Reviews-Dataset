Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I write this review as someone who watched the film a day ago and\\, now that I have seen it\\, I've watched and read the thoughts of others concerning the movie. It was heartening to discover that I was not alone in believing that this movie was rife with glaring faults in its story telling. Visually this movie was very well done and there are gems of brilliance in the story telling\\, mainly with regards to the Luke and Rey portion of the movie. Unfortunately\\, these gems are overshadowed by half of the entire movie being devoted to a Finn subplot that\\, on top of being ridiculous and borderline stupid\\, is wholly inconsequential to the plot. I'm not kidding. Half of the movie could be cut out and it wouldn't make a lick of difference to rest of the narrative.  More specific narrative complaints are the ultimate handling of Snoke and Luke. At first Snoke's character is actually very well done. He's portrayed as exceptionally powerful\\, just as insightful as Palpatine\\, and his personality is spot on. Arrogant\\, but with an intelligence and cunning that belies what eventually happens to him. In meeting his end with the cheap\\, transparent trick with which he does\\, his credence and build up as a compelling villain for the audience is completely and utterly let down. Luke's end is done slightly better but is still a let down for true fans. His death was a betrayal of long time fans of the franchise.  The original hero of Star Wars\\, instead of facing down Kylo in person and dying what would have been a heroes death\\, fake fights him with a force projection and fades away from exhaustion from afar. IT'S MADDENING! The best character in the movie would have died either way but the director chose the way that detracts from the movie and the character. It doesn't make sense\\, which is what I ultimately have to say about this movie.  So many of the actions and decisions of the characters\\, the plot points\\, and the decisions of the directors and producers just plain and simple don't make sense. The Star Wars franchise and its fans deserve better","true":true}
