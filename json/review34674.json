Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the cool parts of the story were cut down to hit the time limits for cinemas and the crappy parts of the story were injected without any thought to keeping this aligned with the original trilogy.  too much CGI for my taste","true":true}
