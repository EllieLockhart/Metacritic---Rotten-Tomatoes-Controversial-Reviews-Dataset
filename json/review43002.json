Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. It was like it was written by a 7 year old. No plot\\, no details\\, weak fight scenes...Snoke who can apparently move a person with a wink was unable to see his light saber coming into his side. And Kylo who can read people's minds couldn't figure out that he was fighting a hologram at the end of the movie. You never find out about the Knights of Ren and who cares...Ren is the worst villain I've ever seen and I mean ever. And Luke\\, OMG\\, the jedi that brought down Dart Sidious and helped restore balance to the galaxy dies at the end of a heart attack from his exhaustion as a hologram. The entire movie felt like a SNL skit. I was waiting for Andy Kaufman to pop out at the end of the movie and say\\, \\\"Gotcha...\\\" DO NOT go see this movie unless you want incredible disappointment. Honestly\\, I enjoyed watching Disney's Moana better than this. What just happened?","true":true}
