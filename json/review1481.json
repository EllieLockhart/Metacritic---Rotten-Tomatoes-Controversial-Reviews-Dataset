Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a guy who originally saw Star Wars in the theater when it was first released (before it was called A New Hope) when I was 13 (the perfect age) and have always loved Star Wars\\, seeing all the different versions - I'm at a loss for some of the negativity directed by fans towards it. My only quibble is the \\\"slow chase\\\" that was a driving plot device that didn't make sense and I had a hard time that Luke\\, after all he's been through in the original trilogy\\,  would even for a second allow himself to come close to wanting to destroy his sister's and best friend's son and not try to save him\\, like his father. Kylo\/Ben obviously had \\\"good\\\" in him\\, so that's out of character for Luke. Everything else was fine\\, loved the plot twists\\, the special effects\\,  the other character development\\, and was especially grateful for one last scene between Luke and Leia.","true":true}
