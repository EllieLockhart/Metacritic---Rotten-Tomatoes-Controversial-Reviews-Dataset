Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't perfect\\, but it was far better than the handful of butthurt fanboy trolls would have you believe.   Ignore the minority that spams all the reviews\\, comment sections\\, and forums.  This was a solid movie filled with all kinds of fun new trick\\, exciting new ideas\\, and a bold new direction.  I enjoyed 95% of it\\, and the 5% that gave me pause is easy to overlook.  What a fun\\, exciting\\, new and different take on Star Wars.","true":true}
