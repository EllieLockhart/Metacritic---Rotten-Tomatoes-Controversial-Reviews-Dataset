Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Es una buena pel\u00edcula pero no es star wars \\, si quito algunos personajes malos en las pre-cuelas\\, estas son muy superiores\\, y mantienen la esencia\\, sin contar los chistes tontos que jamar tuvo esta gran saga\\, creo que se debi\u00f3 respetar la idea de lucas que ya tenia para esta triologia","true":false}
