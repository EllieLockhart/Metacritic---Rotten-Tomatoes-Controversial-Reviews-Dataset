Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Alot of the professional reviewers have to address what gripes everyone has. The director butchered the movie! Bad comedy bad story tons of plot holes. People give the prequels a bad reputation\\, this movie is far far worse\\, I would rather watch a standalone jar jar movie than this garbage.... Wasted potential extremely disappointed\\, dont fall victim to viewers remorse.","true":true}
