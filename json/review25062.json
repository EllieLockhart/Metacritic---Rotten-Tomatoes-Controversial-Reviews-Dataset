Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My word this is probably the most awful Star Wars movie since Attack of the Clones. I guess if you are SJW-minded\\, where all that is required to make you happy are women in power positions and a racially diverse cast (in spite of how boring and uninspired their story arcs may be) who lecture the audience while morally pontificating to another character\\, then you'll likely side with the critics. However\\, if you're looking for a good story with good characters with the hope of having Disney throw a few bones to the fan boys\\, then (as the user reviews suggest)\\, this movie will rank as one of the lows in the franchise history. There was so much potential for the new Star Wars trilogy - so much to work with\\, so many ideas already in place that could have been leveraged\\, but instead of using it\\, they turned this into a progressive iconoclast's dream of not learning from and adjusting to past failures\\, but rather about destroying all vestiges of the past because in the past there was \\\"failure\\\" and it was \\\"boring.\\\" In the end\\, this turned into a Fast and Furious movie in space\\, only it sucked worse than a Fast and Furious movie because none of the men were able to actually be masculine risk takers - remember\\, we're not going to win this with risk taking\\, we're going to win this by saving what we love (oh\\, except if you're  a woman\\, then you're allowed to destroy the enemy via a suicide mission to save what you love). The first trilogies (and especially the original) were about swashbuckling and heroism. The new Disney-run franchise seems to be about SJW lecturing and burning down the past. Won't be spending any money re-watching this one (either at the theater or at home)\\, and certainly am not interested in seeing Episode IX. I'm actually looking at Episodes I - III\\, which I considered disappointing\\, dull and ham-fisted\\, and saying to myself\\, \\\"Oh\\, they weren't that bad.\\\"","true":true}
