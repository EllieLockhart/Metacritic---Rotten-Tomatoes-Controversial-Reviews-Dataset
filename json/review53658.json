Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Awakens was my least favorite Star Wars movie before I saw The last Jedi. Yes I like episodes 1\\,2 & 3 more than the last episodes 7 & 8. With The Last Jedi we finally see Disney doing what everyone thought they would do\\, milking Star Wars for all it was worth\\, and was that milking scene in the movie for us fans in case we had doubts? \\n\\nThe acting was bad even by Star Wars standards. The movie was mainly shown in dark scenes (hiding the bad CGI?) The story was almost totally redundant. The villain was totally wasted. Luke was terrible. Rey was unwatchable and the whole thing felt so small. Like watching 2 average episodes of a Syfy show on Netflix one after the other.\\n\\nBesides when the Calamari Cruiser crashed into Snoke's Ship nothing else was WOW worthy.\\n\\nI hate to say this but I want Lucas Back. Lift your game Disney. Please.","true":true}
