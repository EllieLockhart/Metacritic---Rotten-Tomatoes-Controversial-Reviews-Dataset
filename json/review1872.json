Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sickening gut punch of a movie.\\n\\nThe visuals and music were gorgeous but thats where the good stuff ends. This was a bad movie and absolutely awful star wars movie. The story made no sense\\, existing lore and continuity was completely disregarded\\, Luke is utterly unrecognisable from his original beloved character\\, dialogue is terrible and plot holes abound.\\n\\nThis film as killed the remaining love I had for the start wars universe","true":true}
