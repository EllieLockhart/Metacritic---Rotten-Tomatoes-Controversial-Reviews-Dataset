Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Insultingly bad.\\nEqually insulting is Rotten Tomatoes pretending this film has 50% audience score when anyone can see\\, its more like 15%!\\n\\nLooking back at the original trilogy makes you wonder how it could ever sink this low.","true":true}
