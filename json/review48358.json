Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will just make you feel empty and disapointed afterwards with not much intrest for the next film. Pretty much everything that was built up in the force awakens was ignored and made it seam like the movie tried to be the first in a new trilogy instead of the second. Visually stunning but thats about it\\, alot of plotholes and missed opportunities summs this film up","true":true}
