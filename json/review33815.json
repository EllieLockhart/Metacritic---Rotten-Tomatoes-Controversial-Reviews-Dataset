Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Why couldnt we see just how much knowledge and power Luke and Snoke had. They had so much mystery and potential and it was wasted!!!\\n\\nRey was a better pilot than Han. She's a better force user than Luke. She understands droids and Wookiees and can use force mind tricks... and she had no training. She made it into her 20's without doing things related to the force and now she can lift a mountain side?!\\n\\nIf you think about it\\, Luke didnt do ANYTHING the entire time. I kept waiting for something that the other movies had. Something amazing that would bring you back to the theater again and again. This movie had a few scenes that were decent: Kylo and Rey vs the guards maybe... The slow speed chase and the Finn and Rose plot line was pointless! A waste of screen time. I could write so much more\\, but others have covered it. I want to give it half a star out of 100 but this will suffice. \\n\\nOh\\, and a last thought: Walking out of the theater\\, I felt an emptiness. I had never felt that after any Star Wars movie. Is that what you were going for Mr. Johnson?","true":true}
