Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am stunned by how poor this movie actual is.  I never thought Disney would let SJW politics into its products.  \\nYou can not virtual signal the audience into thinking this is a good movie.  Star Wars was a resurrection of old serials and WWII heroism.  This throws heroism into a literal book burning.  \\n\\nThat is the underlying subtext that drove me crazy. Every interaction of Poe Dameron is where the proof is in the pudding.   The story itself is STUPID.  A 2 hour chase.  Sooo much filler.  Whatever. Boring.","true":true}
