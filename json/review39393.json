Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film isn't perfect - parts were slow\\, there are plot holes\\, questions that are not answered\\, some rough acting\\, and some less than compelling characters. BUT it's still a good movie! Star Wars\\, as a series\\, is riddled with these exact problems. This movie feels more like the original trilogy than any of the prequels. Go with an open mind and you'll enjoy it!","true":true}
