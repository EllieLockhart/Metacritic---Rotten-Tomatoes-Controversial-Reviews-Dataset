Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was made to subvert expectations. Without getting into spoilers I'll say that the pacing was horrible\\, the decisions of the characters are bizarre on all sides\\, there was enough Deus Ex Machina to compensate for a lack of cohesive story telling. I'm putting this right next to the prequels the same way I'd put TFA next to the original trilogy; sure it was basically mimicking ANH but at least they did a good job of it and made an interesting movie. This is hot garbage and I'm not sure if it's paid shills or fans stuck in the glow of their desire to love this making this have such good reviews (remember how much people loved the prequels when they came out?) but I just don't get it and I'm a BIG fan.","true":true}
