Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE DEATH OF EVERYTHING WE LOVED ABOUT STAR WARS\\nI feel so bad for today's kids. I grew up on the original Star Wars trilogy\\, which clearly laid out how love\\, calm\\, and self sacrifice = the light side of the Force. Hatred\\, anger\\, selfishness = the Dark Side. It was pretty clear cut\\, and helped guide my morale compass growing up almost as much as anything. Luke embodied these ideals and struggled with the darkness and the light through his 3 story arc\\, before solidifying himself as the greatest hero in the history of movie-dom by saving his father and the galaxy. And now we have TLJ\\, where Disney threw everything we hold dear out the window. Luke is destroyed and is treated lower than dirt. The Force is destroyed. The main character Rey is essentially a Sith in the employ of the Resistance with her rampant use of the dark side. The rebellion is destroyed. Everything the rebellion worked for in the original trilogy is destroyed. Don't worry though\\, the Porgs and horse-dogs are saved! yay! Because that seems to be an actual priority for some characters in this movie (over\\, say\\, saving the lives of their friends.) Long Live Supreme Leader Ren and the completely victorious First Order!","true":true}
