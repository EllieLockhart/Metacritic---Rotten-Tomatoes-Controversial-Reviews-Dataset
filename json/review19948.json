Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was fine. Spoilers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKudos to John Williams for getting a paycheck without doing any new work. All the big themes were pretty much rehashings. The big scene with Rey in the throne room played themes from RotJ The Last Battle\\, where Vader was conflicted. The Falcon flying through the caves was RotJ Into the Death Star. which was in turn a rehashing of the trench run from SW.\\n\\nIn the skimmers\\, when Finn decided not to turn back\\, he continued in a straight line\\, and pushed the throttle all the way forward\\, therefore someone who turned away then turned back toward him would need a much higher velocity to intercept him.\\n\\nThe one thing that really got me though was Luke was a real Jedi. He messed up\\, then he went into seclusion instead of doting something about it--like Yoda did\\, and like Obi-wan did.","true":true}
