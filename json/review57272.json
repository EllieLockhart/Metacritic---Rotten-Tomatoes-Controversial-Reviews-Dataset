Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie... I am not sure about. \\nWhile there were some great moments in this\\, there where also some big mistakes and bad things in it too. \\nFirst of all: I don't care about politics\\, but I hate it when someones agenda is pushed into my face\\, while I just want to enjoy the movie. \\nThe whole scene with Rose on that casino planet was so dumb. \\nSpeaking of Rose: that character should not exist. Nothing against the actor\\, but the character was pointless and useless in the whole story. The Jar Jar Binks of the sequel trilogy. \\n\\nThe rest of the movie was alright to me\\, altough they dismissed a lot of mysteries from the previous movies. \\nThe effects where nice\\, the action was good. Luke's performance was fun. \\nThere where funny jokes here and there and some interresting designs for new creatures. \\n\\nI am still looking forward to episode IX\\, especially now JJ Abrams is coming back. \\nI give this movie 3 stars out of 5. \\nMy advice to Lucas Arts: keep Kathleen Kennedy away from Star Wars. \\nWe don't need feminism in the enternainment industry. She is the reason why this movie has a 48% on this website.","true":true}
