Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible! Disney has ruined Star Wars for me.  I saw Star Wars as a kid in 1977\\, and I really wanted to enjoy the last Jedi... but it was just awful and does not understand the Star Wars characters or universe at all.","true":true}
