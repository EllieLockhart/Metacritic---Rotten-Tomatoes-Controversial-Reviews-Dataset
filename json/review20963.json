Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was honestly disappointed in this movie. I take no issue with the actors\\, they all did a great job with what they were given to work with. The humor was weak and the story was poorly written. Basically\\, if you're a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean 3\\,4\\, or 5 you'll love this movie.","true":true}
