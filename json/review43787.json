Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie that has ever come out in my opinion. I was disappointed in so many ways\\, too many to mention in a short movie review. It was a good movie but for a Star Wars fan it was humongous disappointment.","true":true}
