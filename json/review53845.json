Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"here's so much that's wrong with this film\\, it's hard to know where to start. But here's the most glaring issue - everyone who supposedly a hero\\, or on the good side\\, is failing. And not in a heroic\\, Luke giving it his all against Vader to save his friends (and succeeding in saving them\\, against all the odds\\, whilst getting his ass handed to him by Vader) - but in a really fucking pathetic way:\\nRey is sent to retrieve Luke - completely fails\\nFinn is sent to find the code breaker - completely fails\\, hires someone who sells him out\\, he completely fails in his mission to disable the tracker and instead leads to the FO finding out how to identify the last remaining ships of the rebellion\\nHondo\\, after an arc about how it's strategic genius to evacuate and not fight because she had a brilliant plan to mask the escape pods\\, fails\\, the trick is uncovered due to Finn's failure\\, and then resorts to fighting\\, which might have been worth a bit fucking more earlier and completely ruins the meta-narrative. If I were a strong young woman watching that my take away would be 'let the ace male pilot fuck shit up a bit more early on\\, otherwise you all get wiped out'.\\nLeia has just gone from being in charge of some kind of large paramilitary force attached the galactic government to completely\\, trooplessly fucked in\\, what\\, three weeks? Fail.\\nLuke\\, who is determined the Jedi should end\\, and is the most powerful force user left\\, apparently\\, managed to dent the first order's schedule by circa five minutes\\, without telling anyone this was his plan\\nThey're.. they're just fucking useless at this rebellion business.","true":true}
