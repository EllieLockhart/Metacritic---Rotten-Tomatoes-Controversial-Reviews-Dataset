Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just came out of this film for the second time. First time coming out\\, I was shocked at how different this film was from what I think we were all expecting.  Rian took this franchise to a whole new life and the message was clear: the force isn't so black and white as we all thought... When I found out that there were so many mixed reviews for this film\\, my shock grew even more-had we even seen the same film?  The only way I can comprehend what is going on is that it's not what people were thinking was going to happen\\, and so they are blindly taking that disappointment and using a scapegoat of the film just being plain bad.  This film was the most visually impressive Star Wars film to date\\, by standards of CGI and cinematography. The symbolism in the film goes beyond what any other Star Wars film has dared to go\\, and through my second time watching this film I really started to understand the true vision and appreciate Johnson's masterpiece. I think anyone who hated it needs to give it another chance and really pay attention to the story being told-even Hamill backed off from what he said and told us he completely agrees with the decisions made. SPOILER WARNING: I truly believe people are going through the same journey as Luke was in the film.  Hopefully some of them will finally realize that letting go of our old way of thinking about the force is the right path to take.","true":true}
