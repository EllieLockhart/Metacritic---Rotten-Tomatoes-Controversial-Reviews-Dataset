Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are things to like and dislike about this movie but\\, in the end\\, this is important to the Saga and a good movie. Very little happens as expected\\, but that's a good thing. At the end\\, everything has changed.","true":true}
