Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst not the best Star Wars film\\, I feel some people have a short memory when describing and reviewing\\, when you consider Episode 1-3. Some really good original scenes. Definitely worth the 2.5 hours and ticket price. Don\u0092t let the poor audience rating put you off.","true":true}
