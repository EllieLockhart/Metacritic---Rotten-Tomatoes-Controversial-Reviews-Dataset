Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete utter travesty and a slap to the face of all Star Wars fans. From all the plot holes to no character development (good job on snoke and captain phasma Rian)\\, to characters you don't give a s**t about (I'm looking at you Rose and Admiral Holdo)\\, Mary Popins Leia\\, Luke is a miserable walrus boob milk drinking coward. Rey is a basically a Jedi knight with little to no training. They basically s**t all over Luke's legacy with the awful ending. I just cannot get over how bad this movie is. They didn't get one thing right\\, not even by accident. I refuse to go see episode 9 because there is no point because all the characters you care about are gone. Star Wars is officially dead. Thanks Disney for ruining Star Wars.","true":true}
