Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very good tribute to the gost of Star Wars past\\, whilst setting the scene for the ghost of Star Wars future. A fitting way to say goodbye to the old generation of heroes and prepare the way for a new generation to take the story on in new and exciting directions\\, with enough emotional engagement to ensure I'll be back for more.","true":true}
