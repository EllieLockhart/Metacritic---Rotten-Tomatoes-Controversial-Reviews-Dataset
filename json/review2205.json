Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first i despised this movie. After multiple viewings i still dislike it. great action and directing. but poor character such as rose still hinder the movie. episode 9 will have to be good in order for star wars to end this trilogy well.","true":true}
