Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how there can be such a large gap between the critics and fans scores. Are the russians involved?\\nOr is the mouse paying them off. Quite hard to elaborate without spoilers but good luck with a Rian trilogy. How they feel that he has earnt that after this dribble is beyond comprehension. The marvel-esque jokes were a total cringe and the timing of them was poor. Certain characters were made to be a complete waste of time. In a 2 and a half hr film about 25 minutes was relevant. The rest was a cgi quip fest that lacked any substance at all. At times it felt like a star wars parody. How long will it be before disney demands a porgs film? I rate it at the bottom between clones and menace. Added nothing to the saga at all.","true":true}
