Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you absolutely hate Star Wars-this is still a Star Wars film. You may like it more than usual\\, but it's still Star Wars.\\n\\nIf you LUVVV Star Wars\\, you should probably just keep watching the original trilogy. It's what you want. \\n\\nIf you just like movies\\, and possibly even grew up with Star Wars--but don't have a shrine to George Lucas in your house--this movie's a lot better than you'd expect. You should give it a try. It's a fairly well done\\, well-thought out evolution of what Star Wars is\\, without being an emotionally-stunted clone of everything you've already watched 100 times. And it's much prettier than you normally can expect from SW. \\n\\n(But\\, If you're Mark Hamill--this puts you in a hard spot. It gave you the chance at credibility\\, and an actual character to play--but you'll probably have to disavow it all in order to save face with the legions of Con-going autograph acolytes that bring you Frankincense and Myrrh.)","true":true}
