Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The half star is for quality CGI for the plot of the movie (as a star wars fan) it should 0 (smashed against the wall)  Last 30 minutes is laughable\\, with clich\u00e9s from the Matrix....  So much good graphics spoiled by a bad director\/producer.  Kim Jun-Un is in it or is it really Kelly Marie Tran ?","true":true}
