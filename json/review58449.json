{"101487":101080,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All great things must come to an end and so it has with star wars. What an awful STAR WARS movie\\, no excuses! No continuity from TFA which was a retroboot of a new hope anyway but its incredible how disjointed these movies are. \\n    I understand that the original trilogy members wont be around forever but disney has destroyed everything that made these characters great and has nullified everything the ot characters did\/stood for. Disney wants to get the fans invested in these new characters but have produced no reasons for us to care about them at all\\, in two movies all the new characters have had no impact\\, no growth and are flat one dimensional. The numbered star wars movies are about the SKYWALKERS\\, not introducing new characters with the old ones and having the new characters play the roles the characters of the OT played!\\n    The humor was awful and out of place\\, and the blatant propaganda in the movie really removed me from what should have been an awesome experience ! Is it really worth being known for writing\/directing \\, being an executive producer over the worst star wars movie ever just to educate the public on how war is bad\\, rich people are evil\\, men are hopeless without super hero women? Rian johnson isnt to blame\\, he is just the guy who said yes to the parameters disney set for him\\, which is probably why colin trevorrow was fired. \\n   At this point i dont even care about star wars anymore and will not be seeing episode 9 and that may be fine with disney. what they are forgetting is that the fans they are dividing and alienating are the same ones who have children and friends that they will not be taking to see anymore of their star wars movies ! To the people who say \\\" i dont care if its a terrible movie\\, ill see it because its star wars and i love star wars\\\" . You are the ones enabling this to continue\\, the general population doesnt care anyway but the \\\"fans\\\" are the ones responsible for the current state of star wars. In the end its just a movie\\, a form of entertainment\\, its just too bad to see a cultural phenomenon destroyed to endorse the current \\\"trends\\\" of this great nation. Also its hilarious to the people bashing rotten tomatoes because the score is so low\\, swearing they will use metacritic from now on when the score is the same there as it is here. In a day where social media is king\\, who cares about \\\"critics\\\" reviews\/opinions\\, nobody disney has granted access to view their movies beforehand is going to have anything negative to say for fear of losing that grant ! Wake up\\, multiple views are not needed to decide if a movie is good or not. Listen to what you already know to be true\\, its a bad STAR WARS movie!","true":true}
