Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I saw it I hated it\\, but my sister wanted to see it and made me go again with her. The first time I saw it I loved the casting and acting\\, but thought the editing was really choppy. I more or less stand by that opinion\\, but it's much better the second time; because when you know where things are going it's easier to follow. Overall\\, a pretty good Star Wards movie\\, if you're willing to sit through it twice (5 hours).","true":true}
