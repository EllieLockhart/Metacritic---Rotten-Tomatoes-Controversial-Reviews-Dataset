Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie. The action was good and the plot was interesting. I liked that Fin's little side quest didn't end well. I was convinced they would try to pull it off somehow. I found that there was a certain depth in this movie that wasn't  quite there in its predecessors. I \\ndidn't like that there were so many plot twists and last minute saves.","true":true}
