Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really thought this was a bad solo movie and even worse in the Star Wars Universe.  It is beautiful\\, but poorly written was many gaping plot holes.  \\n\\nWhile it is okay for each director in a series to have his own vision\\, if you are basically going to disregard every plot point that was built up in the first movie of the series\\, just pass on the project.","true":true}
