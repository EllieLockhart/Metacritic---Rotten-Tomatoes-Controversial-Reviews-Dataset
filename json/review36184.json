Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was full of plot holes and a frustrating lack of plot development.  Many characters introduced in The Force Awakens are tossed to the side in favor of new characters who add little to the universe other than to say a bad one liner here or there\\, or characters that are added just to sell toys.  To add to the insult the Last Jedi does not take the Star Wars universe seriously adding a slew of awful jokes or moments meant to be funny\\, where in reality they come across as childish and frustrating.","true":true}
