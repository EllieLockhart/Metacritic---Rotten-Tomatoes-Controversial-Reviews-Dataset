Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every male characters is seen as incompetent and every female character is a Mary Sue. The film throws away everything JJ built in the previous film for no reason. The comedy within the film is horrendously cheesy and unnecessary.","true":true}
