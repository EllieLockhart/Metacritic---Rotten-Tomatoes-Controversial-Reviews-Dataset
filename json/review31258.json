Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things were bad about this movie. Plot holes and inappropriate humor at bad times. Acting was good and special effects were great. Just a bad story. My least favorite Star Wars movie by far... to each their own I can see why people like it. My straight forward opinion is the movie has no balls.. Can somebody just have an agenda and want something. I felt nothing for any character what so ever. I hope jj Abrams can fix this.","true":true}
