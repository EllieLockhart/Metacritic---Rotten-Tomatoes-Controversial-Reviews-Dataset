Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a travesty. SPOILERS below:\\n\\nThere is any number of reviews on youtube you can watch to show you all the flaws. Here is a quick recap:\\n\\nNo character growth. Shallow characters that are basically just tropes. A plot that makes no sense and is convoluted..which you know is just horrible\\, because how long have they had to write this movie? It must be that it just got into too many hands\\, one person could not have written this movie thinking it was good. There is almost nothing good about this movie. A couple good visual scenes. There are jokes that don't belong\\, heart warming scenes that are cold as ice because they don't make sense\\, and just an overall cavalier attitude was employed in terms of the films consistency\\, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it...who wrote this movie? Why did you do that? It was very unfortunate.","true":true}
