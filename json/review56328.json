Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure\\, it has flaws\\, but that's not what drives the movie.  It's more about where the stories are going rather than where they have been\\,  It is attempting to bring in new fans\\, not satisfy and appease the old.  In fact\\, if anything\\, it is saying to the old fans\\, \\\"these are movies\\, not bible verses\\, get a life and enjoy them for what they are\\, and don't deify them for what they are not.\\\"  As a pure movie\\, it is escapist fun and looks and sounds great.  As a Star Wars movie it brings up as many questions as it answers\\, and does not give the safe and satisfying answers to some of the more daunting questions asked in \\\"Force Awakens\\\" but isn't that what a middle movie in a trilogy supposed to do?  As social media becomes more of a polarizing place\\, we need to make decisions and judgements on our own and go in not wondering why people like and dislike.  You\\, as a fan\\, are allowed to make your own choices and calls about what is good and bad\\, and should not be swayed by self-proclaimed \\\"protectors\\\" and protesters of what is a bygone era and a sad statement about the influence of review sites like this one.  All I would tell a fan or friend is that you may leave angry\\, frustrated\\, disappointed or fulfilled and encouraged by what is still to come\\, but at the very least\\, you will leave THINKING about what you experienced.  And that is the reason we go to the movies in the first place.  So go to the movies\\, and make your own decision.  Just remember that it's YOURS and not for the world to arbitrarily agree with.","true":true}
