Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie the story sucked it went absolutely nowhere.   There was nothing exciting going on no WOW moments\\, and for awhile I felt like I saw this already when  Rey was brought before the supreme ruler. Can you say Return of the Jedi?  It's like they are simply banking on the franchise without making decent stories.","true":true}
