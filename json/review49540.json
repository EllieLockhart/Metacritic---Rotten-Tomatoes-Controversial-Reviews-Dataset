Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, in a not good way...after the book burning I started losing my way in the point of this film....the plot\\, the script direction....the characters....luke sucked boy just wow","true":true}
