Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete mess of a movie. Had beautiful scenes and some very high moments but never had the courage to actually change the status quo of the new characters. Seemed disconnected from the Star Wars Universe and left little interest for the next movie. Many plot holes and out of character moments that will make you dislike the movie the more you think about it.","true":true}
