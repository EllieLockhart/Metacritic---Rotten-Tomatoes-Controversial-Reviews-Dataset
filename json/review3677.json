Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better acting than Phantom Menace\\, enjoyed it a bit more than Force Awakens\\, but otherwise a movie with a lot of plot and tone problems.\\n\\nToo much humor\\, some intentional\\, some unintentional\\, to the point that it felt like the movie was trying to be a parody of itself. The dialogue between Poe and Hux was funny\\, but it sucked out the tension of the scene. Hux still feels miscast\\, him and Kylo look like two kids in charge of a bunch of adults. Leia flying through space made me laugh out loud. They should have just killed her off at that point\\, that would have been a powerful moment if she had actually died then.\\n\\nThe extended fleet chase felt very contrived\\, made no logical sense\\, and Poe and Finn's side plot was literally pointless. People have never heard of tracking ships through lightspeed\\, when that plot point is used TWICE in A New Hope (Vader tracks Leia's ship to Tattooine\\, Death Star tracks Falcon to Yavin IV). Poe\/Finn side plot only happens because Vice Admiral doesn't explain anything. Vice Admiral's plan makes no sense anyway\\, if they won't notice transports sneaking off\\, then why wait? Evacuate transports right away\\, jump all the big ships\\, and the First Order will jump after them.\\n\\nAnd if you can wreck a fleet by jumping a capital ship into it\\, then why didn't they do that with every single empty ship as it began to run out of fuel? Or why didn't the First Order jump one of their ships through the middle of the rebel fleet? Why isn't this tactic used constantly\\, all the time?\\n\\nRey is a Mary Sue\\, and other characters are more like plot points. Snoke? No background\\, just a plot point. Phasma? Practically a cameo so we can have a cool fight for Finn. Vice Admiral? No background\\, never seen or heard of her before\\, nothing invested\\, pure plot point.\\n\\nThe Luke stuff was pretty cool\\, and the force projection plot device at the end WOULD have been cool IF Luke didn't just die anyway. Like\\, \\\"Ha ha\\, you thought you killed me but I'm not even here! Oh wait\\, I'm dead 2 minutes later.\\\" Dumb\\, anti-climactic.","true":true}
