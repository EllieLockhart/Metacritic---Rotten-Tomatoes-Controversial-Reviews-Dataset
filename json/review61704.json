We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First and foremost I must acknowledge the beautiful graphics and smoothness of gameplay\\, its as close to perfect as I've seen in any video game. The animations\\, sound\\, and world building is second to none. That's where the positives end for me. The plot completely drags beloved characters through the mud for no reason whatsoever. Its all hopelessly nihilistic. None of the characters overcome any struggle at all. Ellie ends up losing EVERYTHING shes built. Loses her father figure\\, Lover and child\\, all the way down to losing the ability to play the guitar. Congratulations naughty dog\\, you've  succeeded in creating the most masochistic story ever told.As far as the specifics of the story\\, I dont really want to get into that. The one issue I will bring up with the ending though is how in the hell does a beautiful flashback of Joel make Ellie want to STOP drowning Abby? Wouldn't that thought make her want to finish the job EVEN MORE??  What an absolute joke. Its really starting to feel like if there is a severe emotional reaction caused by a shocking scene with dramatic music behind it\\, the shills will just keep coming back for more. These writers fail to understand there needs to be so much more to a story to have an audience fall in love with the characters in this world. None of these characters are humanized at all or realistic in the slightest... We get to watch multiple \\\"tasteful\\\" sex scenes (according to the critics) which in reality are more of softcore porn..  Let me get this straight.. two 18 year old girls still obviously struggling with the notion of their homosexuality have a mature\\, intense sexual experience (while smoking weed)? Have the writers forgotten what it was like to be that young... Absolutely absurd writing\\, top to bottom\\, Im not even gonna touch on the abomination that is Abby.  If we have any hope of maintaining good story telling in this medium we have to stop buying this trash.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
