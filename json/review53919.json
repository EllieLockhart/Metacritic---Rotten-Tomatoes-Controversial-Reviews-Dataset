Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How let down i was when i went to see this film i eve got to take my dog into the cin wit me as i am sad 46 and alone in the big worls anyways bac to the film ..what a hatch job they did to luke i Was a 7 yea old boy whe the first starwars film hit the CiCinema cinema as still to this day rem wal ou and thi wow what was that ive just see wAs it real i tem thinking it was sutch an amazinG film and visuals where from anotheR time so i am a big old fan boy and they are close to me ..and now what They did to poor mark hamil  in this film is all bad i dIdnt reconice the Person at all The lUke I Knew and loved was just not in this film at all ...i was so upset for mark as now finding out his true fellings about the Way luke was going shame on disney on just forgeting us older fans for doing sutch a hachet job on luKe.
