Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wish someone could convince me to like this movie. \\n*Spoilers*\\nThe Force awakens was an obvious re-hash of previous material\\, but I was still interested because it also maintained some of the original spirit of the franchise. The Last Jedi\\, which still re-uses several plot lines\\, felt like a severe departure. There were some incredible scenes\\, visually\\, but it wasn't enough to save the weak plot with too many useless side stories. The opening scene with General Hux turned him into a caricature and instantly put a bad taste in my mouth. It removed any interest in his character and felt very much like a Guardians of the Galaxy esque moment that everyone wants to put in every movie (looking at you Suicide Squad and most of Thor: Ragnarok). Then\\, knowing that Carrie Fisher has passed\\, I found myself thinking \\\"do I really needed to see Princess Leia's corpse freezing in space\\\" only to find out that she survived the giant explosion\\, freezing temperature\\, and vacuum of space and is now flying back to the ship. She added nothing to the rest of the story - they had an easy out that was respectful to the character\\, and then brought her back for no reason. Why exactly did Luke need to project his appearance to fight Kylo if he was going to die anyway? Why did they choose a plot about running low on fuel - especially when the larger ship could have used lightspeed at any time? or called in other ships? This is really just the tip of the iceberg\\, I just felt so disappointed after leaving. I had to try to convince myself that I was enjoying it the entire time\\, but to no avail.","true":true}
