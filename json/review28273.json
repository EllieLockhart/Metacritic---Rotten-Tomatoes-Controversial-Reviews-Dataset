Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor plot\\, bad acting\\, and a strong social justice warrior agenda cripple this movie. Bombs dropping in space\\, spaceships running out of gas and then losing their momentum\\, a pointless side plot that ends with nothing\\, and a cynical\\, weak Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nNone of the big questions from the force awakens have satisfying answers.\\n\\nOh\\, and apparently Carrie Fisher is Marry Poppins.","true":true}
