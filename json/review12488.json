Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can only assume anyone who liked this movie has never actually seen the original trilogy.  It's complete shite and Rian Johnson should NEVER be allowed near a franchise film again.  Luke wanted to kill his nephew?  That's an odd character development for the person who risked their life to redeem his father who was literally the worst person in the universe.  And hyperdrive is now a weapon?  Seems like the whole Rebel attack on the Death Star would have gone a lot better with this bit of knowledge.  WTF...","true":true}
