Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography was amazing and most of the visuals were also very well done\\, but none of this can make up for horrendous writing\\, plot development and character assassinations.  What they did to Luke was completely uncharacteristic of that character as had been established by the first three movies and even if you argue it was it was never conveyed nor established in the movie. Things that cause a massive character change can\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t be glossed over\\, it requires involving the audience and showing them the emotion that character experienced. I won\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t bother with the rest of this trash. The acting was well done and the actors were convincing and believable but what Disney has done with Star Wars is appalling. I have never loved the prequels more than after watching episodes 7 and 8.  I have so soured on my beloved Star Wars after these last two movies I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)m not sure I will bother seeing the 9th and my birthday is May 4th. I bleed mitichlorions yet cannot stand the new trilogy.","true":true}
