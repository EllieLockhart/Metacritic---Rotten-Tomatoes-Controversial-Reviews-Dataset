Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a brilliant continuation of the Star Wars franchise. Not quite as good as the force awakens but it definitely holds its own in the series. I would say the last 20 minutes outshine the rest\\, and unfortunately a lot of the movie is spent on a B plot which turn out to be a futile effort which is a little disatisfying but worth the watch and very enjoyable\\, regardless.","true":true}
