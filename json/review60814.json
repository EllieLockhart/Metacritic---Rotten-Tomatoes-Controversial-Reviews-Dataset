Playing as the main character Ellie on a revenge mission was a little cliche but worked well. The problem however was naughty dog brought in a new character with no real background and this wasn\u2019t explained too well similar to a lot of new characters in the sequel. No background and no real attachment to these new characters showed how focused the company have been on different elements. My big problem with this game was the idea of playing with a character who Ellie is trying to gain revenge on. This character is detestable after her acts early in the game and for whatever reason we have to play roughly 10 hours with this character with naughty dog trying to force it down our throats this character isn\u2019t too bad really. That unfortunately was not going to work which made the story quite bad unfortunately. The parts as Ellie were perfect and fine if the game followed along that path then the story would have been fine. An 8 out of 10 seems fair all things considered.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
