Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a terrible disappointment for me. They abandoned all Star Wars qualities and created something cheap\\, lacking of any productive storytelling and reckless to George's masterfully created storyline.","true":true}
