Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"One of the worst games i've ever play\\, include leasbian\\, trans\\, bi I don't care but atleast give them a good storyline and good dialogues. You go and kill off joel almost as soon as the game starts whom we've waited to play for 7 years. And to kill him off in such a disrespectful manner\\, i mean you want us to believe that Joel has gotten soft while living in Jackson while Ellie has become a Master killer\\, give me a break! Stupid story\\, lack of inovativeness\\, the game forces you to like Abby. It tries to forcefully change the perspective which the first part built and tries to brainwash us by saying Joel is bad. Which in turn only makes matters worse and we hate abby more. Dina has 0 % charm\/personality. We don't get to kill anyone meaningful by ourselves\\, only in cutscenes or quicktime events. They want us to believe hate\/revenge  is bad and Ellie doesn't kill Abby in the end because Joel would have wanted her to forgive her but inturn abby gets to get away with everything in the end. She show 0% of remorse and they want her to be seen as a hero and a victim of injustice. I for sure ain't gonna buy any naughty dog game in which Neil Druckmann is involved moving forth. Utter disappointment. Save your piece of mind and money please. I fell in love with the first part and now i hate this one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
