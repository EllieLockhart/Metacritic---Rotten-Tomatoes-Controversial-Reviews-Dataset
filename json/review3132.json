Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Baffled by the haters! Loved 98% of the movie. Only the odd comedic moment and a scene that goes on a bit too long to complain about. The film has major twists and turns\\, good character development and probably the best Star Wars sevens ever!","true":true}
