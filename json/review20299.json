Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was terrible. Like all of JJ Abrams recent films it was pretty and shiny but lacked memorable characters\\, storylines\\, dialogue and depth. I could make a movie twice as good with half the money and I've never studied film.  When this movie comes on TV in a few years time you won't care to watch it. A jumbled mess made out of a dumpster fire of childhood memories and ham-fisted attempts at audience emotional manipulation. One star for Luke Skywalker and that's about it.","true":true}
