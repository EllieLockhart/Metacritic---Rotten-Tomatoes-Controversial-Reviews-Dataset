Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed it. It was outside of the Star Wars norm\\, which while making me a little uncomfortable\\, expanded the universe in the way it needed to. Some of the jokes were a little out of place\\, but I laughed a lot\\, sat on the edge of my seat\\, and felt the conflict between many of the characters.","true":true}
