Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars ever! I came to the cinema expecting answers from TFA with excitement but what I got was gotcha moments and felt digusted after. This movie is no fan service instead its a middle finger to Star Wars fans. This episode has ruined Star Wars for me and no longer care for it anymore\\n\\nPros: Nice visuals\\, Praetorian Guards\\nCons: Boring space ship chase\/battle (fuel as factor..really?)\\, WWII bombers *yawn*\\, no lightsaber duels\\, cringey humour (that Poe\/Hux intro scene)\\, boring villians\\, can't relate to any characters\\, Canto Bight shoving boring SJW agenda in your face\\, gotcha moments\\, Rose Tico as the diversity hire to cater to the asian market failing miserably\\, Leia Poppins scene is horrible\\, plot holes everywhere (no I'm not reading books to justify poor storytelling) and Luke Skywalker's character asassination into Jake Soywalker.","true":true}
