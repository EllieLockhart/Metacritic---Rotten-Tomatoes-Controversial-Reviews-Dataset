Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Immediately immerses you in the Star Wars universe and has enough surprises to keep you guessing on how everything will go down. Overall\\, an entertaining movie that is a worthy addition to the franchise. Long live the Resistance.","true":true}
