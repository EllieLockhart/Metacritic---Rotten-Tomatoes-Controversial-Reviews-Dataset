Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While certainly fun to watch TLJ drops the ball in so many ways. Characters are wasted and misued. Pointless story arcs that accomplish nothing take up large chunks of time. Bizzare scenes and plot holes run rampant. There is a good movie in here somewhere but overall the story is an unfortunate disapointment.","true":true}
