Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was absolutely excited to see this. Now\\, I regard this as the worst Star Wars movie of the saga. At least the prequels had fantastic choreographed duels. What's the point of the side mission\\, the code breaker\\, Snoke\\, Luke\\, this entire movie? Mutiny\\, space ships running out of gas\\, Leia flying through space?  So much wasted potential. \\n\\nAre we really worried about a second rate dark side villain that is now running the Order? He's been physically and mentally defeated in the past. Hardly menacing. \\n\\nAnd poor Luke. What a waste. To have his character be so fragile\\, defeated and ultimately useless. Again such wasted potential. I'll remember you as you were\\, hopeful\\, strong and full of life.","true":true}
