Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just got out of the theater after seeing it the first time. George Lucas looks like a freaking genius for selling off this franchise after what's become of it. That was a stinking pile of dog crap and I'm a big star wars fan. I saw the original when it came out and have seen them all at the theater. \\n\\nThis one was probably the worst. The prequels were terrible stories\\, but at least they were based on some sort of logic. This one defied it at almost every turn. \\n\\nIt's amazing that a huge corporation like Disney let this off the lot. They have completely shot themselves and their investment not in the foot\\, but squarely in the head.","true":true}
