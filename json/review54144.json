Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I expected the same plot devices of Empire Strieks\\nBack (unwilling mentor\\, having to evacuate right at the beginning) but after seeing the quality of writing and acting in Rogue One\\, I was horribly disappointed in this movie. From the suuuuuper slow \\\"getaway\\\" plot to the horrible comical treatment of a prank phone call in a serious movie(I think they were trying to channel the laid back feel of Guardians or Ragnarok and came off as insulting and stupid) I was just horrified that I had waited all this time to see what I thought would be a good middle of a trilogy film. Instead of setting up a good 3rd film\\, it felt like they just ripped everything apart to  surprise us with the unexpected\\, or as they would likely call them\\, twists. But it was just bad. Either mirror the original 3\\, repetitive but I was willing to accept it over the phantom menace crap\\, or go all original. Setting up a mysterious master villain and killing him off suddenly wasn't a twist. It was as if a kid was writing the story and thought hey\\, this will shock them. You lost me comepletely there\\, even after all the other horrible writing. And it went down hill from there. There were decent scenes\\, but they were completely over shadowed by the rest. It was like a bad reality show or comedy instead of a gritty space opera. You have failed me for the last time\\, Star Wars. I'm done.","true":true}
