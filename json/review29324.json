Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy did something obnoxious\\, that doesn't belong to the Star Wars. It has massive problems with everything from the poorly written script\\, jesuitically destroying the bare essence of the saga and the Mary Sue for the main character to the colossal plot holes and laughable fighting scenes. It's literally AWFUL. I think Rian hates Star Wars he has humiliated and killed (or killed and humiliated) the Luke Skywalker\\,  This is not my Luke and not my Star Wars.","true":true}
