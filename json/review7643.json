Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything that was set up in the Force Awakens was literally thrown away. This middle installment of this new trilogy is a spit in your face with an embarrassing mess of crude humor and poorly paced \/ written storyline. Nothing was accomplished in this movie \\\"saga wise\\\" other than the pointless SUICIDE of Luke Skywalker. I also no longer care about the new main characters. I have no interest in episode 9 now. \\\"Let the past die.\\\" More like\\, let what we loved about Star Wars die.","true":true}
