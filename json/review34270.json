Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 1st movie I saw in a theater was Episode IV in 1977\\, I was six. The Last Jedi is probably right alongside Empire Strikes Back as my favorite. I loved this movie and all of the risks that it took\\, the pay off for me was astounding. I know a lot of people get caught up in vaugeries of cannon and the details of being a Star Wars fan\\, but if you go in just wanting to see a great Star Wars movie I don't see how you can go wrong with this film. It's popcorn action\\, laughs and a few tears mixed in\\, basically what we go to movies for. Well done to all involved.","true":true}
