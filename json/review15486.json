Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. I was 9 when Star Wars came out. We didn't call it A New Hope\\, it was just Star Wars. It appears that the under 20 crowd hates this movie. They seem to think that facts are being overturned. But this is science fiction. You make the rules as you go along. There are a few cringe worthy moments\\, but they are only moments in a 2 hour and 30 minute journey. It's very well made and ushers in a new generation\\, like Old Ben did when Vader struck him down. Enjoy.","true":true}
