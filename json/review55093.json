Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie and just couldn't.  I don't know where to begin.  Most of the other unfavorable reviews listed chapter and verse what is wrong with the movie.  I will add just one other thing: If they were trying to showcase how wonderful a women led fighting force can be they made the case for the opposition.  The Resistance\\, as led by all women generals\\, failed in their bombing mission\\, retreated from combat only to run out of gas in the middle of the galaxy\\, had no chain of command\\, people going AWOL everywhere\\, and starting mutinies left and right\\, and a commanding officer who kept her battle plans secret from the rest of the Resistance. Hmmm... maybe that's why at the end of the film there were only ten of them left hiding in a cave.  The makers of this film just threw every interesting plot point from TFA away and put nothing of interest in its place. The final insult was the treatment of Luke Skywalker.  We waited 30 years to see him as a full Jedi Knight and we get a whiny loser crying on an island.  Sigh\\, nothing left to say.","true":true}
