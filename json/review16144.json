Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I mean this movie is fine if you turn your brain off so you can: ignore the awful writing\\, ignore how porgs are flogged so hard to be sold as toys and unnecessarily used\\, stupid filler arcs\\, leia being a superwoman and making the inquisitors from rebels look like the saviors of star wars\\, complete disregard for the EU of star wars\\, lack of a proper bad guy\\, bad jokes + more shit. VIII could've been the redeeming movie for the new trilogy\\, instead it's the nail in the coffin. \\nThis movie shows Disney's complete disregard for wanting to build upon and create continuity between older star wars content. That's the last time i will see a movie at midnight release. If Dave Filoni took over directing IX then the movie might not be trash.","true":true}
