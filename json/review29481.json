Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is a wonderful director. Internal consistency of plot story and themes is super important. I think there is some complexity to the story that makes things easy to miss but overall I think this movie is great for multiple reasons.\\n\\nToo bad JJ hated it. I would have loved a sequel to this movie.","true":true}
