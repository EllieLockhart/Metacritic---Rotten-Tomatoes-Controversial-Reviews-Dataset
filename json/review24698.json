Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was mediocre\\, plot was absolute garbage\\, characters made no sense\\, acting was trash\\, and the fight sequences looked like something out of one of the bad TMNT live action movies. \\n\\nThere were literally dozens of plot holes\\, from the fact that with Luke's reaction to Rey finding him meaning we have no explanation\\, and can have no explanation\\, for the map to Luke\\, to the fact that Rey is the most ridiculous mary sue ever shoehorned into a movie. \\n\\nIn a movie clearly made for the sole purpose of making more money\\, it is ironic that the only even semi decent portions were with the toy selling porg and Chewbacca. \\n\\nSnoke was a pointless character. Ren is basically the only even somewhat reasonable character. By the way\\, they literally changed where his scar was. This was some The Room tier bs.","true":true}
