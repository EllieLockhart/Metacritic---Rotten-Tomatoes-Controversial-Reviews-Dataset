Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe the bad audience ratings for this show! It certainly wasn't perfect\\, but it was very solid. It was less slavish then the last entry\\, but still connected well to the whole Star Wars 'universe'\\, even if it's attitude toward Jedi seemed to me to be a bit confused.. \\n\\nThe effects were marvelous\\, the acting very good and the directing very well done. It was probably a bit longer than it could and should have been\\, but it rarely left me bored or wandering. And yeah\\, the Porgs (cute as they are) and the Vulpines (or whatever they're called) are mostly there for marketing reasons\\, and the PC nature of the cast is a bit annoying\\, but these are minor nits.\\n\\nI almost wonder if the bad ratings are from Russian trolls because the good guys here are called The Resistance.  If so\\, please give it up and spread your crap elsewhere - leave entertainment alone.","true":true}
