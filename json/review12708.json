Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could rant about this movie for maybe a month str8. there is so much wrong w it. long story short\\, its MEGA bad\\ndont watch unless you wish to be excommunicated from good cinema for almost 3 hrs","true":true}
