Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a terrible mess. The second act is the only thing that kept me from walking out. I honestly don't know how critics continue to drool on anything Disney. It has been the same thing for too long honestly. Sad after the potential that was built in The Force Awakens. And they're bringing the same director back???? Uh-oh...... Critics will eventually catch on!!","true":true}
