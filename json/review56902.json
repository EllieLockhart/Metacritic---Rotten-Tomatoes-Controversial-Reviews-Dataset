Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The strangest thing is why the critics have given it such a high rating. \\nMy biggest disappointment with this film was not its mediocrity\\, lack of plot\\, and contrived jokes\\, but the fact it was given such high scores by professional critics. The argument seems to be that it is for a new generation of star wars fans\\, and if you didn't like it\\, then you have the problem. But using the same principle\\, critics could say Home Alone 4 is one of the greatest films ever made. \\nFor me\\, the drama was in the underlying notion that the empire\/1st order had an element of evil in them. This was totally destroyed by them becoming part of a comedy routine. The storyline was childish\\, and for a lot of the time I was bored\\, or laughing at the wrong moment. Just poor all round.\\nWill I watch Han Solo? It already sounds like a Guardians of the Galaxy rip off. And the next Star Wars? I will wait for the honest reviews\\, and maybe save my money.","true":true}
