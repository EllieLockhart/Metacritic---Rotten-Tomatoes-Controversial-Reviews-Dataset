Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how to answer this\\, like I loved it because its star wars\\, and it some of the best moments ever for a star wars film. The Rey\/Kylo\/Luke relation is purely brilliant\\, but the film is let down by pointless subplots that don't really add anything. However\\, the acting was incredible\\, Mark Hamil and Adam Driver particularly. A solid 4\/5 But had potential to be more.","true":true}
