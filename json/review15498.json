Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it the first time I saw it in the cinema\\, I\\ve now seen it 11 times in a cinema\\, and countless times at home. Watching it again tonight as a part of 2019 first SW marathon. Simply love it and love Star wars. I feel lucky to be alive at a time where these grand movies are made. :-D","true":true}
