Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had this diatribe all planned out to rage on the fanboy haters here\\, but truth be told\\, I am not feeding the trolls. \\n\\nIn the end\\, it's not a perfect movie. There was some weird stuff that made it feel awkward\\, but in the end\\, it was a Star Wars movie and an awesome one at that. \\n\\nEveryone loves Emprire\\, why? Because it was the 2nd movie that blew away the 1st and set a new tone. Jedi\\, not so much. By the time Jedi came out\\, fans had already envisioned their own take on the Star Wars universe. \\n\\nToday\\, 30+ years after Jedi\\, not only do fans\\, but other writers have taken what was created and formed a whole new universe that painted a specific light on events that carried only one idea forward. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens and The Last Jedi challenges all of that thought and paves a new road ahead and I applaud them for that. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi pays tribute to all things Star Wars before it. The movies\\, the prequels\\, the cartoons\\, etc ... it's not Empire and never will be as there will never be another point in time where there is no little universe to point to other than Empire. \\n\\nWith that I say to the fanboys\\, grow up and move out of mom's basement and get a job. \\n\\nTo those who have not watched the movie\\, get ready to have all your ideas about how the Star Wars universe works be challenged and I can't wait for the next movie.","true":true}
