Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OMG! #StarWars #TheLastJedi was surprisingly f-ing awesome\\, refreshing and better than TFA. One of the best and in line with Rogue One as one of the best\\, if not the best\\, of all the Star Wars movies ever. Also\\, BB-8 is still my favorite character in this sequel trilogy and has the best scenes in the movie. Worth more viewings. Rian Johnson\\, you are what Star Wars needs now. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f P.S. Stay for the credits\\, because Carrie Fisher will be remembered.","true":true}
