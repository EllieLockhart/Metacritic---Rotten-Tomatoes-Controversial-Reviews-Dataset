Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately it appears that Disney has decided to turn the Star Wars franchise into a series of comic book movies. Story is sacrificed in favor of ham-fisted moralizing. Character development has been tossed out the window to give us invincible heroes from the first frame. Emotion is gone\\, only to be replaced by overwrought action scenes. If given the choice\\, I would actually rather rewatch the prequels.","true":true}
