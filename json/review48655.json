Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst film in the series. Just a bad film in general though as well. Too little exposition\\, constant forced humor that ruins any serious momemt\\, and a complete lack of respect for common sense physics laws. I loved 7\\, and rogue one\\, maybe i had too high of hopes for 8\\, but right now i feel like i just wasted 3 hours of my life... at least my expectatations for another Disney Star Wars is finally lowered.","true":true}
