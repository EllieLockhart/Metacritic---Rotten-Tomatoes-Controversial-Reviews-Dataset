Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A step down from Force Awakens.  Luke's story and interaction with Rey was interesting\\, but the rest of the plot seemed mostly incoherent and unlikely to me\\, like a bunch of loud scenes each ending with an ex-machina.","true":true}
