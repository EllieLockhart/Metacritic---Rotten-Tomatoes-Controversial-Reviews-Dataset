This review bombing trash here is awful play the game first and then judge. I didn't pay attention to any of that and enjoy playing and after I finished today I looked what the fuss about. And the transgender character I didn't know until I learned\\, it wasn't that obvious at all and after I learned I know what character they mean but I couldn't figure it out when I didn't know this piece of info. The ending was weird but it fits nicely into this whole game atmosphere and points they were trying to make. Imho ending was little bit oblong but I understand they're intention.\rGraphics was amazing I still don't really understand how can it be so beautiful on my old OG PS4 and I didn't really experience FPS drops that much but my PS4 is old and full of dust and need thermal paste so maybe overheating and underclocking was a problem on my system but that is all about graphic. Graphics in this game with one word: beautiful.\r\rCons: I encountered several bugs through playing that basically ruined my checkpoints. It was a lot more than OG but I only played Remaster of OG so I don't really know how many bugs had OG OG PS3 ver when it came out\\, but I am sure they will fix most of this issues by updates.\rAlso\\, checkpoints were all over the place in places that I didn't really need checkpoint on every meter they gave me that\\, but when I had one of the hardest fights in the entire game I didn't have checkpoint until freaking kilometre away\\, that angered me but I guess The Last of Us was always hard so.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
