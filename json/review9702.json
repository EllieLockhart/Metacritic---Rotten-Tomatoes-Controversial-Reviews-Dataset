Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good production but an unprofessionally visionless story with poor quality jokes. Writers of this movie had no idea about Star Wars\\, unless it was their intent to make millions of people quit this franchise.","true":true}
