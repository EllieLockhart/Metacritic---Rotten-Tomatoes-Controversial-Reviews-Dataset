Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay so apparently half-Star ratings don't count on this site\\, which is very strange. This has earned the last Jedi an extra half a Star from me\\, and a revised review. This movie really does get worse and worse after seeing it. I hated it as I was watching it\\, the stupidity and arrogance of the writing insulted my admittedly meagre intelligence right away. But as the film curdled in my mind\\, it got worse and worse. The last Jedi is a bitter\\, mean spirited recipe for hate. Whether you care about Star Wars or not\\, it's an appallingly bad story. I have had fever dreams which were more entertaining than this dreck. As a life-long Star Wars fan\\, I am beyond disappointed. This film is not only terrible\\, it ruins all the films that have gone before it. It's a total disaster.","true":true}
