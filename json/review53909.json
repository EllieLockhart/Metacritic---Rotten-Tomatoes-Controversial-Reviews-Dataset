Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can some people and critics of the movie are saying it's good because it felt totally new and fresh... like how?  It's the same plot from the Ep V and VI. This movie shows that Rian Johnson has never seen SW. The lore\\, the characters arc\\, the pacing\\,  the force\/balance and its mysticism\\, the appropriate jokes\\, the legacy of the original trio\\, the motivation for character's actions. It's all but gone. And the plot holes\\, my God the plot holes were so noticeable. It feels a like a 15 years old fan fiction. Terrible. Awful. Horrible.","true":true}
