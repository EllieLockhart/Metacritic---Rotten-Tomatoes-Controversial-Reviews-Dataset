Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the director is responsible for the story and the editing then the director failed.  Too many agendas going on in this film that distract from what should be the only goal of the movie - to tell the Skywalker story.","true":true}
