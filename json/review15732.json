Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED this movie. Not only were the cinematography and character building fabulous\\, but I feel that this is the natural direction the series - and the Jedi\/Sith\\, must take. Just as the original Star Wars (Episode IV) start with a young\\, niave view of the world - everything is black or white\\, one or the other - this explores the challenge of grey areas\\, of the balance of dark and light in everyone\\, and that we all have the force\\, it is how we chose to use it. Can't wait for the next one!","true":true}
