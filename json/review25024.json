Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My second favorite\\, behind ESB. The scenes between Rey and Kylo are particularly good\\, and their fight with the red guards is one of the best action scenes I've seen in a while.","true":true}
