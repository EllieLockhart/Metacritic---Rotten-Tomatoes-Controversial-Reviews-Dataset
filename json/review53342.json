Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely the worst film in the Star Wars main saga. (SOLO takes the cake for worst Star Wars film full stop).\\nI don't care what anyone says about it being \u2018different and good' it is NOT! The storyline is just so pathetic! There is so much filler action which visually is great but such a waste of time considering this is the second last Star Wars saga film... Did anyone actually even care about the characters after this film? It was such a disappointment. Now there is so much to be done in the upcoming last movie because so much was wasted in this one. It just completely went off the rails\\, completely disregarded Previous plot points and set ups and just really feels like it's own random one off movie? \\nHate what The director did with Luke\\, hate what he did with Leia\\, didn't even care about Finn\/Poe and hated all the new characters.. Talk about blowing it. How this was even allowed\\, I have no idea. Has Disney lost the plot? I'd take a George Lucas Star Wars film ANY DAY over this one. At least the story would stay on track with the whole saga and any surprises would be good ones... The Force Awakens set up for such a good follow up movie\\, but they blew it.. When all 9 films are done\\, you can literally skip this one. It won't make a difference. ","true":true}
