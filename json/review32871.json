Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars was my childhood and I went into this one with high expectations but it fell short for me. General Hux in VII was villainous and power hungry\\, here he was the pantomime clown... The \\\"can he hear me\\\" at the start of the film really grated on me\\, thinking\\, is this the way this film is going to go? Luke milking the beast was unnecessary and these moments gradually spoiled the film for me. Phasma looked absolutely amazing when she was first announced before VII was released and she was an utterly pointless character who was killed off without adding any kind of threat or menace. The casino scene wasn't as bad as I expected until the chase riding the beasts spoiled it. And the trailer reveal of the new AT-AT had me excited until I watched the scene..... So\\, the AT-ATs march in a straight line whilst the resistance move towards them in a straight line flying the least manoeuvrable ships they could find .. No interaction apart from the resistance being blown to pieces from a distance\\, it wasn't exactly an epic battle. Luke and Kylo Ren were good but everyone else was wasted.... Snoke had potential but inevitably was killed off before he could actually fight anyone and the tag team sabre fight was exciting but... Come on\\, use the force at some point\\, it's not Robin Hood","true":true}
