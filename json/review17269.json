Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to enjoy this movie\\, I just couldn't. It made a mockery out of many characters and the jokes were even more cheese than the Phantom Menace. In my opinion this is the worst star wars movie. I loved Rogue One\\, and enjoyed TFA. This movie has its moments of shock but overall it just sucks.","true":true}
