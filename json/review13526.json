Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like I have just watched the most expensive piece of fan fiction ever made. Sure\\, it's impressive to look at but there's so many questionable situations\\, deus ex machina moments - not to mention one of the poorest decisions regarding a characters story arc I've ever witnessed. For all its flaws\\, Force Awakens is still infinitely more rewatchable than this movie is. Was I watching a different movie than the movie critics?","true":true}
