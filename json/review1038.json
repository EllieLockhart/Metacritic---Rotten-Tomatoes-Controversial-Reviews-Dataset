Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another mediocre Star Wars film with crappy plot writing and beautiful flashy effects.  This felt like a Star Wars film written by someone who didn't care much about Star Wars.  If it was a standalone film that had nothing to do with Star Wars\\, it would have been \\\"ok\\\"\\, but as a Star Wars film it kind of sucked.","true":true}
