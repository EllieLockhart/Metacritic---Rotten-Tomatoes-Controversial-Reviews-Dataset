Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy cow what a giant waste of my $12 and more importantly my time... Jar Jar had more of an impact and story  than Snoke and the SJW bullshit being crammed into the film in place of an actual story is a giant steamy pile a pewp.","true":true}
