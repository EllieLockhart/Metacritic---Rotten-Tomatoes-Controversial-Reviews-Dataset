Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much wrong\\, it could take a book to explain it all. The writer seems to have been given a list of boxes that needed ticking and scenes and characters just got thrown into the movie for no reason other than to tick the boxes. No real effort to integrate these into the movie in a way that makes them work (and therefore make them less noticeable) so they are noticeable. Infuriatingly so\\, for many people.\\n\\nThe ridiculously fast development of Rey's powers is so far over the top\\, it's reminiscent of people on multiplayer games who spend tons of money getting all the good gear and powers without earning them. We don't get much of a sense of accomplishment when Rey turns up and just wins.","true":true}
