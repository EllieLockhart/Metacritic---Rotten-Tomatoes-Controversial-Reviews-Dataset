{"101487":174385,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half is extremely boring. I felt myself nodding off when half the characters were stuck on a ship while the other half were stuck on an island for 45 mins. It all seemed pointless. Last Jedi is a filler episode. They try to make up for it with an action packed finale that ultimately feels like a desperate attempt to get you to come back for the next one. Not worth seeing in theaters. Not even really worth renting. Wait for it to stream on netflix. ","true":true}
