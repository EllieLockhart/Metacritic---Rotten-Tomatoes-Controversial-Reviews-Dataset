Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a hard core SW fan\\, this movie is such a wierd and bizarre experience. It's soul crushing because it destroys our childhood hero Luke\\, who is now a depressed\\, pessimistic and unfatherly. It's soul crushing because rebels are no longer noble freedom fighters\\, but suicidal kamikazes (asian bomber\\, Holdo\\, Finn and many others)\\, driven by hate (Poe)\\, self-righteous\\, insubordinate (Poe and the rest of the younger rebels)\\, class resentful (Rose)\\, and have other many wierd and ambiguous moral feelings. SW innocence and classic fable morals are destroyed. It is now a mucho more cinic\\, morally ambiguos world\\, of shitty parents and horrible masters o no parents or master at all.  You are BY YOURSELF. All these is really soul crushing in many ways. Apart from that\\, dialogue is bad\\, humer is wrongly timed\\, mostly verbal and not very starwarsy. The basic SW rules of how the Force is supposed to work are thrown through the window with no development to prepare us for it.  The movie also has pacing problems\\, and structurally very very weird. I can appreciate impressive visual\\, great acting and Kylo Ren is actually very interesting. The movie has franchise destroying potencial. I'm so conflicted and confused as how this came to be. Could keep talking forever...","true":true}
