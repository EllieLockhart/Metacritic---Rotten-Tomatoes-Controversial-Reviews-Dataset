Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long\\,  Die Hard STAR WARS fan i am crushed by this abysmal mess.  Everything you liked about Star Wars\\, destroyed\\,  every question you had\\,  unanswered\\,  everything that could have been amazing\\,  ruined. 40 minutes of boring Finn and terrible Rose\\, a character a million times more annoying than Jar Jar\\, running around a Cantina. Luke turning out to be a cowardly dirtbag who never redeems himself\\,  makes Kylo Ren angrier\\,  then dies.  Leia\\, tedious\\,  needs to die and doesn't.  Poe\\, who cares about this guy? Snoke\\, weak and pointless. Reys parents\\,  nobody.  Rey\\, finds her soulmate and then betrays him within seconds\\, without even convincing him\\,  changing him.  Kylo Ren\\,  made tragic and understandable\\, not redeemed and will be killed instead of saved. The only good parts are Rey and Kylo Ren communing and nothing comes of it because we are forced back into the So Tired\\, good guy rag tag rebels  (seriously which of them is likable?) Vs. Poor broken hearted\\, destroyed by circumstance Kylo Ren? And what will 9 be? Rey murdering the only person who loves her? And zero good light saber battles and corny jokes\\,  it's unfathomable how bad this was. Adam Driver was absolutely brilliant but that's the only star i can give","true":true}
