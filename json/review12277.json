Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure if I want give this a 2 or 3 Star. I am rather torn. The weird milking of the sea beast\\, the anticlimactic death of Snoke\\, no real info on Rey's parents ( I don'tknow I trust Kylo)\\, the overuse of amateurish humor\\, Leia zooming around in space.. the list goes on. \\nI sat there so excited and it was like SW was trying to Marvel. And just as DC can't carry in sassy wittiness\\, this movie felt forced. A few jokes here and there were funny but after a while\\, you actually feel pulled from the movie from the clumsiness at the attempts of humor.","true":true}
