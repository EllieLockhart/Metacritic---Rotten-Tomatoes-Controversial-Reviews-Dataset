Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes and missing sub plots for what is basically one really\\, really\\, really\\, long chase scene.  You learn so little about the story.  \\n\\nThe action was entertaining though and I enjoyed other parts of it.  If you want to zone out and watch some space explosions you will like it\\, if you care about the story you will be asking questions in your seat just as I was.","true":true}
