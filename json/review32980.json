Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story makes no sense. I  try to find one character which was well potrayed or written. There is no one. Luke\\, the saviour of the Galaxy is an attempted murderer of his nephew after leaving one of the greatest alive which was his father. His sister turns into supergirl. Rey needs to train.I like Daisy Ridley\\, but her character might have been not well developed. One Star for SFX-department made a good job.","true":true}
