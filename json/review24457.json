Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More sneaky lefty propaganda forced down our throats by Hollywood and Co.....Star Wars 4-5-6 (The REAL ONES) were a success because they were just like an old traditional and sound Fairy Tale and had\\, like it or not\\, traditional values behind them.. \\\"1-2-3\\\" had no soul\\, but these last ones\\, (excluding perhaps Rogue One) are a dumb Politically Correct script from some degenerate in Hollywood","true":true}
