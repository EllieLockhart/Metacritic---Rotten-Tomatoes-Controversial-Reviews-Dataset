Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account just to review this shart of a film. I didn't think it could get much worse after TFA. I was very wrong. The story is a mess\\, characterization is a farce\\, the humor is awkward and out of place\\, and the \u2018themes' it tries to shove down your throat are complete dogshit. This is the last star wars movie I pay to see.","true":true}
