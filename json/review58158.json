Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow what a let down\\, they destroyed something I thought would go on forever. This film had so much potential. A universe of lore and movie magic and beloved characters turned into a something unfamiliar and unwanted. With the return of the original Star and everyone's childhood hero\\, Mark Hamill\\, hope for a return to good story telling and star wars action was high. Too high. We were going to see him as the teacher instead of the student. Yes! But instead we are Introduced to old\\, bitter man with no hope. What!? Luke was a symbol of hope from the beginning. During the original set he was the hope that allowed Darth Vader to find his way back to the good side\\, he was the hope at ending the empire. Even during the Force Awakens he was the hope the sought. What a let down. Just like this film for a number of other reasons. Perhaps this truely is the last of the Jedi we knew and loved.","true":true}
