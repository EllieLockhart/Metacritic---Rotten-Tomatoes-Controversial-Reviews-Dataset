Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely enjoyable. Great tension\\, a variety of twists\\, and instantly one of my favorites of the series. I\u2019m disappointed only in the people who are so critical. This is a franchise with unbelievably high expectations\\, and it\u2019s easy to forget that the higher one\u2019s expectations are\\, the lower the results will be. The dynamics between Kylo and Rei in this story are what pushed it to be one of my favorites. I won\u2019t spoil that here\\, though\\, but it is incredible. The story is a tough journey because the good guys keep losing\\, and there\u2019s so much to be worried about. That\u2019s what makes for an excellent 2nd installment. To be fair\\, the conclusion of the new trilogy will be the ultimate factor in determining the value of The Last Jedi. But on its own\\, A+. Fantastic character development all around. This movie is also about creating new leaders in the franchise\\, and we get to see those characters grow here. ","true":true}
