Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not bad\\, but not good either. Metrics such as ticket sales appears to be evidence of riding on the coattails of the Star Wars franchise. JJ Abrams sets up a nice lob for the alley-oop to Rian Johnson with the introduction of Luke in the last scene of Force Awakens\\, but Johnson mishandles the alley-oop. The whole casino planet\/horses bit should have been slashed because it does not meaningfully move the story along. Hyperspace tracking and weaponized hyperspace as plot points should have been avoided because now it just brings up the question of why hasn't anyone ever employed those strategies before. Why build the Death Star or Star Killer Base when you can just use hyperspace to launch a large unavoidable projectile into any target?","true":true}
