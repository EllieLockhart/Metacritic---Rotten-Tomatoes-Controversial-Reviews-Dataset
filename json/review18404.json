{"101487":141474,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is almost a full week since I watched the film\\, and still I'm conflicted about its merits. On one level it was a good\\, standard movie - a little over-long\\, but entertaining. But at a deeper level it did not feel like a Star Wars film. There was an emptiness in the storytelling. It lacked the soul and heart that defined the original trilogy and\\, to a lesser extent\\, the prequels.\\n\\nHaving allowed my thoughts to settle during the past week\\, I rate The Last Jedi as a 2.5 out of 5. It is an adequate film\\, but somewhat lacking. My views on the positives and negatives of the film are below.\\n\\nSPOILER ALERT: The remainder of this post discusses aspects of The Last Jedi\\, including plot and characters. If you intend to watch the film and don't want to know what is in it\\, read no further.\\n\\nThe positives:\\nThe cinematography on the whole is well done and gives the movie a quality aesthetic; many of the sets and location shots are a joy to view and well framed. \\nLikewise\\, the space battles are more interesting than in some of the previous installments. The battle engagements are shorter\\, more focused\\, and the special effects are beyond fault.\\nThe interaction between Luke and Rey is fascinating and insightful\\, up to a point - because there was plenty of scope for more to have been achieved here - in particular in relation to Luke's torment and why he had taken the path he did. Mark Hamill's acting is magnificent and one of the film's highlights.\\nAnd then there is Kylo Ren's uneven relationship with the dark side of the Force\\, so dynamically portrayed by Adam Driver that he overshadows Rey as the most interesting protagonist on the screen. \\nThe developing story between Kylo and Rey is now clearly the signature theme for the trilogy\\, and it made for the most compelling on-screen interactions.\\nThe throne room showdown was memorable (albeit\\, with the proviso below regarding Snoke).\\nLeia's no-nonsense final flourish that puts Poe in his place\\, twice.\\nA blisteringly brilliant standoff as Luke faces Kylo and The First Order's ground attack AT-ATs.\\nThe negatives:\\nThere's no real hero. Rey is surely meant to be the heroine of the piece\\, but she is unengaging and that is worrying two films into a trilogy. Her background and deeper motivations remain opaque. It is hard to really care for a character that you know so little about. The classic hero's journey is absent from Rey's character. All the interesting development stages have been left out. Also\\, she lacks emotional empathy\\, other than the edgy interplay with Kylo. It might be that this is all by design. We have one film left to find out.\\nAs mentioned in the positive list Carrie Fisher's performance of Leia was fine\\, but there was potential for more. For example\\, when the communications operator reported that the call of help had been received at the outer rim but no one was responding\\, had it been shown\\, the sadness on Leia's face could have been a showstopper\\, particularly when immediately followed by Luke stepping out from the shadows. As for Leia's flying through space scene\\, the less said\\, the better. I'm fine with the concept - but what we got looked ridiculous.\\nThe new charactors have not developed in any compelling ways. Finn looked the most promising\\, but his side adventure with Rose was underwhelming and a drag to the main narrative. Poe has yet to fulfill the potential he showed in The Force Awakens.\\nChewbacca was a bit player. The meeting with Luke could have given something; that moment when Luke realised Han was no longer around. But the moment was squashed.\\nLuke's finale was uneven. There was the brilliance of his emergence from the smoke during the AT-AT standoff\\, but his ultimate departure missed a beat. Considering the film's ultimate nondescript ending\\, it was a shame it did not climax at\\, or around\\, that moment. If only the movie had flipped to the Millennium Falcon departing with the rebels and then back to Luke on the rock\\, the sunset\\, the empty cloak. End.\\nThe bad guys. Are there any? General Hux is a shallow\\, ineffectual baddie who from the get-go is the fall-guy\/punchbag for Snoke and Kylo. As for Snoke\\, so much potential thrown away with his highly anti-climatic demise. Who was he\\, where did he come from? Perhaps there's a bubblegum card that can help.\\nThe film creaked under the sheer weight of its palette of characters. I had a hard job feeling connected or invested in the fate of most of them. The scripting left out the humanising elements.\\nPlot holes. So many\\, including a slow-motion space chase waiting for ships to run out of gas when it would appear simple enough to have a few star-cruisers head them off. And the casino subplot was weak and added little value to the main narrative.\\n\\nReflecting back two years to The Force Awakens\\, that was a fun and action-packed romp. Yes\\, it did retread past movies in the series\\, but it could be forgiven this as it was the scene setter for the new trilogy. The Last Jedi should have been the consolidating episode\\, but it failed to establish an emotional tether with the main protagonists.\\nThe handling of Luke's character is questionable\\, and Mark Hamill has said so in blunt terms in interviews during the past two years. While I acknowledge the realigning of his character arc is a valid development (though not the only one)\\, it cries out for some exposition. The Last Jedi missed that opportunity. I hope the next and final installment rounds things out.\\n\\nFinally\\, I question the decision to not have the trilogy planned in some semi-structured way. I have read that director Rian Johnson scrapped an outdated draft of what Episode VIII might look like\\, and wrote his own version picking up from where JJ Abrams left the storyline and characters at the end of The Force Awakens. This \\\"pass the parcel\\\" approach to story sculpting must have some bearing on the disjointed feel of The Last Jedi.\\nAnd the film was longer than it needed to be. A sharper focus and editing would have made a big difference.\\n\\nAs I watched the quiet departure of the audience from the cinema at one of the early sold-out showings\\, to me it was a sign that this movie lacked the knockout stuff that many have come to expect from the Star Wars universe. As I mentioned earlier\\, I left the cinema not feeling that I'd witnessed a Star Wars film. It wasn't the same. There were too many diversions\\, too little depth\\, and too many unsatisfying gaps. It may be that Episode IX will deliver the answers that will cast The Last Jedi in a more favourable light. All now hangs on that 2019 release. Back to you Mr Abrams.","true":true}
