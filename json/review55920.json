{"101487":165139,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has created a masterpiece with the Last Jedi. Star Wars has to move on\\, evolve in the right way. This gives the whole series hope and reignites the story. Why would we all want to sit down over and over again and watch the same garbage regurgitated until the end of time. Let's put the 80's Star Wars to sleep and let Johnson weave the story of a new generation\\, a different battle\\, a spiritual one instead of the guns and explosions! Because my friends that is our fight now...a fight for freedom\\, segregation\\, lack of belonging...Last Jedi is clearly the best film since Return Of The Jedi...!!!! Crazy reviews","true":true}
