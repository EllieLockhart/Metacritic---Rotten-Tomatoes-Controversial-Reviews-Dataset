To me\\, The Last of Us 2 feels like reading someone\u2019s first foray into fan-fiction with a potentially compelling story in mind and moral they want to extend whilst not bothering to consider keeping true to the characters they include\\, or at bothering to evolve them\\, nor following themselves the moral they appear to want you to learn: \u201cviolence and revenge are wrong.\u201d The tone seems set: \u2018Revenge is a cyclic horror that never ends well\\, and violence should be reflected upon and avoided as it is a daunting and disturbing act.\u2019 Except in this game\\, revenge is a driving story point throughout and violence feels glorified to a disgusting extent. I can\u2019t help but think back on other games that make you reconsider and question acts of violence and rekindle your humanity like Earthbound or Undertale so skillfully do.I wish they had thought more about communicating their message effectively in offering autonomy to follow through on what appears to be an intent to self reflect and let go of cyclic violence\\, it might have been a great game if they had.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
