Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rather underwhelming\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a solid sci-fi adventure\\, but it fails to build on the promise of The Force Awakens.  After a costly attack on the First Order\\, the Resistance is depleted of resources and retreats to a fortified moon base for a last stand; meanwhile Ray pleads with a reluctant Luke Skywalker to train her to be a Jedi.  None of the mysteries set up in the last film are followed through with or get satisfactory answers; Ray's parentage\\, Snoke's possible Jedi\/Sith connection\\, Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren\\, etc.  The script is poorly written and the characters don't feel the same.  In fact\\, the directing and editing are so different that the film doesn't even feel connected to the previous ones.  Still\\, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic.  And the special effects are especially well-done\\, making for some visually compelling set and character designs.  While Star Wars: The Last Jedi does''t live up to the standard that's been set by the new Star Wars films\\, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (though not by much).","true":true}
