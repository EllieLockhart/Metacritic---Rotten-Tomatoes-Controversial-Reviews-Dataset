Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a good movie unfortunately. I don't think it's a one star movie as far as movies go but I'm giving it one star because it killed the new trilogy. It's incredibly long\\, unimaginative and soulless. They followed the same cookie cutter approach that TFA did but somehow made it even worse. There was no character development or surprising twists. I could have wrote a better overall plot than they did. It lacks imagination at best and was really cheesy at worst.","true":true}
