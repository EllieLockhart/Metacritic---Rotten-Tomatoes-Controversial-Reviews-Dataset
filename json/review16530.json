Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a galaxy defined by clear-cut lines between good and evil\\, The Last Jedi delivers complexity and the unexpected in characters\\, relationships\\, motives and the nature of the force. It's beautifully shot and breaks new ground for the franchise. If you want to pay money to watch a Star Wars film that panders to your every expectation as an uber fan then this is not your film. But if you're a fan who wants to be challenged\\, or just a regular Joe wanting to be entertained\\, TLJ is for you.","true":true}
