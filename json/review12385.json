Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe if Rian Johnson was the director of force awakens this could of been a good movie. The problem is that it fought with the movie that came before it in story\\, theme\\, and tone so much it just left a rotten taste in your mouth. It felt like two rich white boys fighting over who gets to play with their toys and how to play with their toys. If Rian got to direct all three movies in the trilogy I think the trilogy would of been great and if J. J. Abrams got to direct all three the trilogy would of been ok. Sadly J. J. Abrams got to direct the first and thrid while Rian got to direct this movie. This made this movie and the one after filled with your movie sucks and I can do it better no your movie sucks and I can do it better. This made the viewing of the movie\\, story\\, and trilogy disgusting","true":true}
