Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It really felt like Rian Johnson didn't like J.J. Abrams take on the movie so he did his own thing and made a bigger mess out of the movie. Reminds me of Lost where you have a story and they just don't feel like doing that anymore so they just end it and don't explain anything.  Some things were a bit far fetched as well. I grew up on the original trilogy and I liked the prequels but these new movies are not on the same level. Even Jar Jar Binks makes more sense than some of these main characters. Give it back to Lucas to try and redeem this trilogy.","true":true}
