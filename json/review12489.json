Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can only assume the director either never saw the previous films or just hated the series. This was a plot hole laden mess. The treatment of Lukes character was deplorable. Ray and Kylo are two of the most uninteresting characters ever. She seemly becomes all powerful without any work. Kylo isn't threatening\\, hes just a petulant child. I don't think I'll bother going to the cinema for episode 9 after this.","true":true}
