To clarify\\, the characters\\, the different types of villains\\, and the setting as a whole were meant to feel familiar and stereotypical. Not unlike Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods\\, Until Dawn isn't really meant to be a standalone experience - you won't enjoy what you're seeing to its fullest if you haven't also seen at least some of the substantial source material.\rSo the player controls 8 teenagers (portrayed by actors who most certainly are not teenagers) as they wander around a spooky house\\, a sanatorium\\, and the forest and such surrounding the two locations\\, picking up things and piecing together what happened at varying points of the mountain's past. The game jumps you from character to character to try and keep the narrative going. The characters have set attributes\\, as well as relationship meters with all of their friends\\, and your actions as each character alter how the others perceive you. Choices you make as one character resonate with the others\\, and change the story.\rOn that note\\, the \\\"butterfly effect\\\" system the game is so proud of (it even gets its own intro cutscene)\\, isn't as robust as the ones found in the Telltale games\\, or even that of Chrono Trigger. Supposed recaps of certain situations happened differently during my playthrough than they had when I was playing them. While the consequences were the same\\, there was an odd disconnect in seeing things that I didn't do work out the same way as the things I actually did. Similar problems arose regarding lines of dialogue that didn't make sense in the context of my actions.\rGameplay-wise\\, most of the game is walking around looking at things and flipping them over. If you've played L.A. Noire\\, that's honestly the best way to describe it - right down to the over-the-shoulder camera when you pick something up and use the right stick to rotate it. Here\\, however\\, is where the most noticeable problem of Until Dawn shows itself: it doesn't control well at nearly any point in time. The game operates on a nearly fixed camera (think Resident Evil\\, or a Telltale game again)\\, but the right stick is still used to move your character's light source around. Everyone turns too slowly\\, and the light sources\\, whatever they may be\\, are difficult to control\\, because it's hard to tell whether the game wants you to move the right stick in relation to the camera or the character. I'm pretty sure it changed sometimes\\, as well. But that's tolerable; the real problem is once the right trigger comes into play.\rPlayers use the right trigger (R2) to pick up objects\\, push buttons\\, open cabinets\\, and so on. To push a button\\, you must hold R2 until the character's finger presses the button\\, then release R2. To pick up an object and perform an action with it\\, you must hold R2 to pick it up\\, and keep R2 held while doing whatever else is required; releasing R2 will cause your character to place the object right where they found it and then just hold their hand in front of it\\, like they're trying to manipulate it with the Force. Furthermore\\, for some strange reason\\, all of the actions that involve movement in one of these R2 sections translate that movement to the right stick\\, not the left. Anyone who's played just about any 3D game will understand that the right stick is used for camera control\\, and that this is wrong. These sections appear often\\, but thankfully aren't usually time-sensitive.\rIn all honesty\\, however\\, the thing that really lowered my opinion of the game was the lack of a consistent story in this story-based game. In trying to wrangle all of the horror subgenres into one game\\, the developers made a story with far too much going on at once; as though they were aware of this\\, they then sliced away every plot point previously mentioned\\, and put an entire new one in for the game's last third. With more than half the game involving a series of red herrings\\, the final\\, much more action-packed hours lack the tension and interest that was built up for the majority of the game. Furthermore\\, Until Dawn is\\, like the horror films it so lovingly emulates\\, predictable to the extreme. Every plot twist is foreseeable\\, even after the radical shift in subject matter in the last section of the game. And\\, as a side note\\, most of this horror game's \\\"scares\\\" are jump scares that have no context nor significance to the plot at all.\rDespite these concerns\\, I still enjoyed Until Dawn\\, as did my family and girlfriend who all sat down to watch the story unfold. But I think I enjoyed it more than some because I got it for about $30\\, rather than the full price. Like a bad horror film\\, rent it\\, or buy it on sale\\, and you'll have a good time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
