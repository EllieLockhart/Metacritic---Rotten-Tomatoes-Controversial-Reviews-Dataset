Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors both the rich mythology and legacy of the franchise while also turning the Star Wars \\\"schematic\\\" on its head. This installment takes huge risks and challenges the viewer as well as open new doors for the future of the franchise. For better or worse\\, Star Wars has evolved.","true":true}
