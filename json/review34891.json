Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the film could have been better\\, it decharacterizes luke skywalker and adds unnecessary scenes that in the end does not add anything to the movie. his second act is dragged and does not compensate even the third act being more explosive and megalomaniacal\\, the film has very good scenes but the film is without rhythm. they killed the luke and left the live video even the actress being dead\\, had great scenes and a beautiful photograph","true":true}
