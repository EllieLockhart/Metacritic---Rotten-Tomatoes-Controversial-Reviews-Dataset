Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars was a decent movie. I would say good not great. At times they tried to hard to be funny\\, and the storyline felt rushed. I would've liked to see more of Rey's journey to find the force instead of just her getting it on the first try. I didn't understand Rose as a character and found her to be pointless to the plot. It was a fun movie\\, but it didn't strike me as a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
