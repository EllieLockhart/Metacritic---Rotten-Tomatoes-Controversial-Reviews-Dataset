Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About halfway through we get to see the movie Rian really wanted to make: a lavishly styled indictment of the 1% and evil capitalism. The rest is just tacked on; Luke Skywalker does a 180 for no reason\\, bombs fall in zero gravity\\, shields only work when the plot says so\\, the list goes on. This new trilogy is dripping with a political message that white men are bad\\, so they're all made to look stupid or just simply killed off. There is no redeeming quality here\\, Snoke's mysterious presence from TFA was wasted\\, Rey may be the worst Mary Sue in all of film\\, and even the star of the original trilogy hated his role. This 'film' is aptly named\\, for it will surely be the last Star Wars I pay to see.","true":true}
