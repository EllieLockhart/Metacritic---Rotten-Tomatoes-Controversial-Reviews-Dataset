{"101487":103157,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-01-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An abysmal film that breaks\\, no - destroys the legacy of Star Wars and uproots everything that our heroes fought for in the original 3 films. A truly terrible film on every level imaginable. Unfunny comedy\\, cringe-worthy dialogue\\, disastrous pacing\\, underdeveloped characters\\, and not to mention the complete character assassination of Luke Skywalker are just SOME of the MANY examples as to what's wrong with this film. I could go on forever about this movie\\, but there isn't much more to say that hasn't been said already. This film truly earns an abysmal rating of 0.5\/5.","true":true}
