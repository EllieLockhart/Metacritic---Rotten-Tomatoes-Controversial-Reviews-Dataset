Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing\\, I can't believe what Disney did to Luke... even when the Force Awakens was a copy from the first Star Wars: A New Hope\\, it was more appealing and it rose many questions that this movie did not care to answer\\, it seems that the Disney formula of having dumb jokes and some colorful scenes did not work this time\\, they ruined what it could be a great continuation of a story.","true":true}
