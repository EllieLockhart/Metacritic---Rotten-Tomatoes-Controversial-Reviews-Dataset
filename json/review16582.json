Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"inconsistent with alot of what a star wars movie should be 40 minutes to long and some jokes are out of place the pacing drags and the cheesy lines from one character are borderline unbearable but despite all of this it is still a fun movie and still a star wars movie through and through despite what people say its a decent star wars movie","true":true}
