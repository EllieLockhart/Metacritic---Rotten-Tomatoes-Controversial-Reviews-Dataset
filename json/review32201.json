Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars 8 or Star Wars Ex Machina. Some parts could've been taken directly form Family Guy or Spaceballs. Sometimes it feels like they (Disney and Johnson) are not taking the franchise seriously. It's such a big difference to The Force Awakens. I can hardly remember a Franchise where the change of directors is so significantly visible. In style and story. \\nMaybe it's Disneys' desire to cater to kids and families but this one just feels like it's stuck in its teen-years while Ep VII was way more mature.\\nAlso the Character development and the plot feel slow\\, unmotivated and just painfully awkward sometimes. The plots are partly just pointless. \\nAnd I think Daisy Ridley can do so much better. \\nI was so hyped but then so disappointed... Let's see if Howard and Abrams can straighten out that mess.","true":true}
