Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Empire Strikes Back remix. The series already jumped the shark in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, now it jumps the skycraper. On the good side\\, it's the most gorgeous-looking Star Wars film\\, and that's its saving grace\\, despite some characters going Super-Saiyan.","true":true}
