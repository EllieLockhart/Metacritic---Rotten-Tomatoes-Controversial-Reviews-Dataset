I felt like a Charlie Sheen in Platoon - I could observe two similar persons eaten by hate and violence (somehow similar to Sheen observing two sergeants). And like in the Platoon similar persons become totally different. One chose hate to the end for any cost\\, even its own best friends and loved ones.

And because the game shows violence so strong\\, I felt like I would really kill. And I felt these kills were bad.\r\rIt was great adventure and great story. But still I hated the zombie parts - that's why I take 1 point from 10 and my honest score is strong 9.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
