Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This isn't just a bad Star Wars movie\\, this is one of the worst movies of any genre that I have seen.  Bear in mind\\, all of this coming from a die hard Star Wars fan that thoroughly enjoyed The Force Awakens.  From the HIGHLY questionable direction of the story\\, the campy dialogue\\, terrible character development\\, forced cameos\\, plot holes you could drive a truck through\\, cringeworthy acting\\, lack of flow\\, and embarrassingly amateurish plot twists this film is shockingly bad.  It's almost as if Rian Johnson is intentionally spitting on the legacy of the Star Wars we all grew to know and love.  Also\\, expect to see some stupid little fluffy alien creature meant for cheap laughs in literally every other scene.  I can just picture George Lucas laughing maniacally as he counts his money after having seen this movie.  Do yourself a favor and skip this piece of garbage.","true":true}
