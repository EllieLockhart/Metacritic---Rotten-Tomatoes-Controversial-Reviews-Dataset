Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok I'll be that one guy and say it; Rogue One was better. TLJ felt like Disney was pushing plush toys for 30% of the movie. Stupid friggin Disney princess sidekick cameos by random cgi alien animals that made no sense. Luke sucking milk from a bloated cgi alien walrus utter was cringeworthy. Crap lightsaber scenes and choreography that had to be severely slowed down\\, no meaningful Jedi training for Rey\\, no depth to the Sith Villian Snoke\\, and Kylo Ren STILL isn't remotely intimidating. Worst Star Wars villain at this point\\, unless things severely change in the final act\\, but by then he'll probably just \\\"turn\\\". The opening act felt like Space Balls half the time\\, from a ton of comedian cameos to ridiculous punchlines that were written into the MAIN PLOT of a canon universe (how Poe stalls for time). This movie was definitely made for children and parents with young children. To me\\, it was Star Wars Episode 1 all over again- except for it didn't have a badass fight sequence and lead villain like the epic showdown with Darth Maul and Qui Gon and Obi Wan. Rogue One on the other hand had very serious tones with a lot of character development in a single film and you could really appreciate those characters and what they were accomplishing. No clue how this movie is at 93% with everyone praising it.","true":true}
