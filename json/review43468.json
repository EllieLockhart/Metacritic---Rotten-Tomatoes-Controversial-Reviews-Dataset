Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a train wreck of a movie. From the lack of character building with their new characters to the character replacement\\, with no backstory\\, of the old. the plot barely makes sense\\, with huge holes. characters having knowlede they shouldn't\\, not giveing other characters expanations that they should and technology that doesn't and never has worked that way in star wars. in nearly all ways\\, from an unstructured and confusing plot\\, to a lack of character building this movie fails\\, and particulary so with long time fans who have invested in reading and understanding the old characters and how the technology and force in star wars are supposed to work.","true":true}
