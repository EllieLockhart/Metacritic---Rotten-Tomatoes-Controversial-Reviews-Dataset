Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie seems to create holes in the Skywalker story and Star Wars as a whole. Though after watching Episode 9 JJ Abrams saved the story. When doing a Trilogy should be the same writer and director. Rian Johnson tried to change the coarse with his view and did not consider the previous films or the fans.","true":true}
