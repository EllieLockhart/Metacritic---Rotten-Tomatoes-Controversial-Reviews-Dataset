Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was prequel level bad: great actors and amazing effects that couldn't save a horrible story. Star Wars now just feels like an exquisite corpse style movie making\\, where one person draws lines of a creature without being able to see the one from before. It's frankenstein filmmaking\\, meant to sell toys to little kids. The first two originals were great films (Thanks to the editors of a New Hope\\, and the director of Empire Strikes Back). But let's be honest. The rest are here to sell toys to children. I had high hopes for this film to restore the franchise. There were a couple great scenes\\, but they were ruined by lack of character motivation\\, or mislead character motivation. It was a bad story. The critics reviews are interesting. I remember people loved the Phantom Menace when it first came out\\, because they *wanted* to love it. I think it's the same with this film. In the weeks to come\\, the high will wear off and people will realize this movie is total garbage.","true":true}
