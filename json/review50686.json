Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"8 out of 10. Good not great. If you\u2019re a fellow hard core original trilogy fan\\, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. I thought Disney was going to take the franchise in a new direction by ending the Jedi\\, they don\u2019t. Let\u2019s hope the next trilogy will be more original","true":true}
