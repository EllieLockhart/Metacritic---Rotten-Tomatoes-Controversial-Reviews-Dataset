Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Patsy \\n\\nAmerican slang for a gullible and weak-minded person. A patsy is a fool\\, usually a person that has good intentions but is deceived easily.\\nAlso\\, Rian Johnson\\, the amateur director who still believes that Disney hired him due to his incredible directing and writing skills and not because every real director wouldn't accept to be remembered as the one who killed STAR WARS.","true":true}
