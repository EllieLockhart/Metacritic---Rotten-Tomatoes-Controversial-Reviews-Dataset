Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally really enjoyed this installment in the franchise despite what others might think. The many misderictions and subversions made Star Wars meaningful and full of supspense for me again. Really brought me back to my childhood in a surprisingly effective way.","true":true}
