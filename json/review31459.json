Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some plot holes this episode introduced made the entire franchise seem silly.  It's a very accurate caricature of the times we live in - a busy time with no cohesion anywhere.  At least there were some half decent light saber and TIE-fighter action sequences\\, still\\, this movie didn't deserve the publicity (or money) it brought in.  It's financial success goes to show how mindless movie goers are and how little they value their time.","true":true}
