Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I dissect this movie the more I dislike it. It was massively underwhelming and had gaping plot holes. Force Awakens and Rogue One were far and away superior films. Just meh overall. Could have been way better.","true":true}
