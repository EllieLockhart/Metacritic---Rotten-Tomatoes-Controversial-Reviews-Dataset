Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u0092s empire strikes back with a few elements of a new hope and return of the Jedi. So a rehashed movie just like Ep7. There is one interesting Plot line with Kylo and Rey\\, but beyond that\\, the logical inconsistencies frankly destroy what greatness is left in the Star Wars universe. I could rewrite the script of a new hope\\, and return of the Jedi given how unbelievably powerful sending a hulk of metal through hyperspace is. Why bother with Death Star plans when ramming it at light speed will clearly do the trick. Anyway\\, this movie sucks. Think I\u0092m done with Star Wars in general.","true":true}
