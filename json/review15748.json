Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. There were a couple of things that I think are justifiably vulnerable to criticism\\, but overall this is my absolute favorite Star Wars movie. The action is superb. The Character development feels very natural 95% of the time and rewards emotional investment into the characters. I legit cried at the end. The concepts and themes are very interesting and compel you to watch and ask questions. -1 star for Porgs","true":true}
