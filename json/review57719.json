Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Usually not a keyboard warrior but the poor script and editing of one of my favorite movie franchises drove me to share my opinion.  This movie is truly rotten.  Parents no need to look for a babysitter because if you take a baby to the movie you more likely to find die hard Star Wars fans crying louder than an infant.  We all know the cast are great actors but the writing in this movie was worse than Disney's cartoon animation.  Comedy\\, really??  When have slapstick jokes ever been part of a Star Wars movie\\, even Phantom Menace did not contain as many as the Last Jedi.  This film felt more like the Emperor's New Grove.  The Force Awakens was decent and Rogue One flowed like a movie from the first trilogy.  A person watching this movie needs bottle of Ex-lax in order to clear the constipation of multiple plots in order to find a true story.  What is disappointing is\\, through all the diarrhea there is not a complete story.  The movie is choppy.  I don't know whether  to blame Disney\\, the attention span of the younger generation\\, or the money grubbing executives who want to hawk their cheap merchandise. I think this movie was made more so parents could feel nostalgic and take their children to a family friendly not so violent movie.  It does not due justice to the first trilogy and even through the prequels had lame scripts at least the story was coherent.  Wish I could get refund.","true":true}
