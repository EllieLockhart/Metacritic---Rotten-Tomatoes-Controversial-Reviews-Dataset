Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, was an even bigger disappointment than The Force Awakens! The plot was full of holes\\, Luke was reduced to a shell of his former self. Kylo is an even bigger whiney baby than he was before\\, and still we have unanswered questions. Do yourself a favor\\, and don't waste your money! I'm glad I had free tickets\\, or I would really be upset!","true":true}
