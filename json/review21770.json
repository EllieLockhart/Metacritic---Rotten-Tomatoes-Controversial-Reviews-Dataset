Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just awful. What a waste.  Were they trying to make a bad movie? Laura Dern with purple hair and Benicio Del Toro reprising his Usual Suspects persona can't save this movie...if you have an ounce of Jedi in you\\, resist the dark side and stay home.","true":true}
