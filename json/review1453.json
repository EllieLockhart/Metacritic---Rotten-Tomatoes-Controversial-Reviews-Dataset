Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the franchise\\, this one didn't hit the mark.  The Force Awakens renewed my energy for the saga but this movie was very poorly done.  Too much humor\\, and the humor was il-timed.  We were told this would be a darker movie\\, there was nothing dark about it.  I hope we can get JJ Abrams back for the last one\\, Rian Johnson wasn't up to the task.","true":true}
