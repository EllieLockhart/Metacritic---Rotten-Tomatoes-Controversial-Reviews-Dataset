Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an original Star Wars fan\\, I could not have been more disappointed in this movie! Take the plots of movies IV and V\\, mix them around a bit\\, splash on a new paint job and you've got The Last Jedi. They even took some of the script  from IV and V nearly word for word in some areas! Perhaps this was what the writers meant to do\\, perhaps not\\, but the lack of creativity in plot and script was astounding for this industry. \\nI will say this\\, the movie gets a star for awesome visuals and fun new alien critters. Not to mention\\, BB-8 gets a star for just being the sweetest\\, funniest\\, most kick-ass robot.\\nI was almost getting into the final sequence\\, since for once\\, they were not working on destroying the Death Star . . . again. Then they decided to throw in the horrific visual of a red salt planet where it quite literally looked like cutting skin and exploding fountains of blood whenever a shot was fired or the surface was disturbed. I mean come on! Choose any other color to get a cool visual effect\\, but when a speeder flies over the surface with its balance rod dragging through and it looks like a knife splitting skin and kicking up a fountain of blood\\, I don't know about everyone else\\, but I was done. \\nLast part of the rant and then I'll wrap up. Kylo Wren . . . really? I have not seen such a whiny\\, weak\\, indecisive bad guy . . . ever. What happened to the days of Jabba the Hut and Darth Sidias?! Even Darth Vader was really  bad and pretty damn bad-ass and then was swayed to the good\\, he didn't waffle back and forth like some emotionally stunted brat who always looks one step away from a temper tantrum. I mean Kylo Wren's entire reason for going dark was pretty much \\\"my family didn't love me\\\" and even then he was never quite sure about it. \\nAnyway\\, if you can get past the copied and scrap-booked plot\\, the repetitive\\, cheesy\\, and self-plagiarized script\\, and the weak characters\\, the movie is worth seeing for the fun critters and . . . well\\, no that's about it.\\nHopefully this industry can turn in around for VIIII because as a Star Wars fan\\, I would hate to see it go out with this disappointing dud.","true":true}
