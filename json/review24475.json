Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most disappointing film ever. Such a shameful waste of characters\\, actors and money! I laughed at the twists and the jokes just cuz they're ridiculous. This totally meaningless plot leads to nowhere. Poor Mark Hamill tried to warn us\\, we didn't listen. We've all been betrayed by Disney and by this selfish and incompetent director. They brilliantly delivered an expensive and shiny piece of s**t.","true":true}
