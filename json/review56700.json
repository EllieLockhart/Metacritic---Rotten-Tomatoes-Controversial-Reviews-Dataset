Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I read the fans reactions\\, the more I worry these fans don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d this new trilogy. It\u2019s about passing the torch. It\u2019s about saying goodbye to the past while welcoming a new group heroes. It\u2019s about breaking the mold. Episode VII was a pretty shameless remake of episode IV. That\u2019s fine. But had this been a remake of \u201cEmpire\u201d as it very well could have been (and even felt that way in the beginning) do you think the \u201cfans\u201d would have been happier? Since when does \u201cfandom\u201d mean you get to call the shots? Being a fan means you have love and respect for a property\/character\/franchise\/creator\\, perceived flaws and all. Even if events don\u2019t pan out like you\u2019d imagined. It\u2019s about having faith and trust in the storytellers. Rian Johnson did an incredible job and took a ton of risks to make a main saga entry unlike any we\u2019ve ever seen before. In the most interesting and positive way. It\u2019s fine not to like it if you had problems with it. But to jump ship and trash it like this shows ignorance and arrogance. This a risky movie that expands the mythology in unexpected ways. If you think you can do better\\, get a job at Disney. Otherwise\\, I hope time will convince these sad \u201cfans\u201d this is\\, in fact\\, a strong entry. ","true":true}
