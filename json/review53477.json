Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Don't fly too close to the sun or you'll get burned\\\" \\nThis movie works in similar ways. If you look too closely you'll die\\, on the inside.\\nI have never seen so much plot armor nor experienced so large plot holes in a Star Wars-movie before. That alone pretty much took me out of the entire movie\\, but sit tight because it doesn't end there.\\nIt was obvious that Rian Johnson spat on everything that was set up by JJ in the previous film. It was done to such a degree that the movie felt disconnected from the trilogy. Like if there's no requirements regarding consistency throughout the movies.\\n\\nSimply put these \\\"unexpected\\\" turns were handled very\\, very poorly.\\nMaybe even in the worst way possible way? \\nI'm pretty sure they didn't even watch The Force Awakens before they made this one.\\n\\nThe movie begins and ends where the last one ended which made it pretty much pointless in that regard. \\n\\nSomething they actually did put a lot of work in was shoehorning in super cringy political messages which took you out of the movie even more (if such a thing was even possible).\\n\\nI'll give this movie a ripmychildhood\/5.\\n\\n- Per Berglund","true":true}
