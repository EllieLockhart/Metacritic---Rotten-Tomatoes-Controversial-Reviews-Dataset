{"101487":169038,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, this is my REAL review of SW:TLJ -- I am not a bot\\, I'm not fake\\, and I'm not hating. I'm just stating my opinion. The film was a GOOD movie\\, but not a good STAR WARS movie. A good solid Star Wars movie is \\\"Attack of the Clones\\\" for example. In my opinion The Force Awakens and Revenge of the Sith are Great Star Wars Movies. Legendary Star Wars movies are the first trilogy (IV\\, V\\, VI) only. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi takes nearly every wrong direction possible. Luke's character doesn't work from what we know about him in Return of the Jedi. I mean\\, he just goes into hiding? Just because of one bad moment with Ben Solo? I would have thought that redemption would have been his new motivation\\, not becoming a hermit. Leia\\, not having used the Force before\\, suddenly saving herself from the vaccuum of space is laughable at best. Plus\\, building up several plot points in the Force Awakens and then being NOTHING in the sequel does not make for good film-making. \\nLet's look at a couple cases in point - Rey's parents turned out to be nothing...literally nothing! So why the build up!?! Next\\, Snoke is made out to be a big baddie\\, then to be snuffed out by Kylo so easily! Such build up and then NOTHING. Fasma vs. Finn was pumped up to be and epic clash ... that wasn't. This should have carried onto the next sequel\\, for sure. We have the Canto Bight storyline with Bencio Del Toro that ended up being a big fat NOTHING-burger in the storyline. Next\\, Luke SkyWalker finally coming back to the Star Wars Universe\\, only to be killed after 1 movie (this one)\\, and he wasn't even featured that much! What a tease!\\n\\nSo we have no trainers for Kylo Ren and Rey\\, yet we have Leia\\, who's alive\\, but Carrie Fisher\\, who's dead in real life. We have no Luke coming back\\, no more Mark Hamill\\, even though he could still play the role\\, no Supreme Baddies (like the Emperor or Snoke) and new characters that we haven't really emotionally connected with like Rose. What was Rian Johnson thinking? What a mess. The only good parts were the fight with Rey and Ren vs the Red Guard\\, the final fight scene with Luke vs. Ren\\, and the Vice Admiral using the main Rebel ship as a Spear. \\n\\nI'm sorry\\, I'm just done with this movie. What a disappointment.","true":true}
