Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can people be so critical of certain movies and then rate this movie so well? Every critique that you have ever been surprised of when looking at a movie applies to this one. There are so many issues that this movie has and what its supposed to represent that it really is a failure. \\n\\nWhen one watches this movie and sees every other Star Wars... anything connected to it\\, one has to wonder how exactly this movie is supposed to represent Star Wars. It simply does not make sense. It is clear even after ignoring the political stupidity of this film\\, that the new creators disagree with how Star Wars was. They should have simply done a reboot and said... this is how this works. This is how the Star Wars universe works. The Characters from the other Star Wars just don't make sense in this new trilogy. They make is unabundantly clear when they close many questions from Force Awakens with little no to no answers. Basically saying... they don't matter. This is simple Star Wars now. \\n\\nAlong with that\\, why don't we add political connotation to it. The bad people are all white men. Force Awakens at least shows some diversity of evil to represent the universe. Now... well there is not a single male in this film that is a hero. \\n\\nHow do people like this film? You either just don't care\\, and\/or\\, you just like politics being rubbed into every facet of entertainment. The movie is disgusting.","true":true}
