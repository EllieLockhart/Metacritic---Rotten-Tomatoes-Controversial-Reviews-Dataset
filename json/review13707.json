Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find it funny how these outlets are blaming \\\"bots\\\" or \\\"trolls\\\" for the bad reviews when I know several people who agree it was not a great movie. They took my childhood hero and turned into a recluse who milks aliens\\, whines like a child\\, and really doesn't do much in the movie. I get they are moving on from the Skywalker era\\, but don't with some respect for the fans of those characters and the characters themselves.","true":true}
