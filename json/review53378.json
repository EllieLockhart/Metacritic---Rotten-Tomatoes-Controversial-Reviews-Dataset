Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did this movie ruin Star Wars? Of course not but it didn't make it better or worse. just whatever. People are pointing fingers at the  die-hards like our expectations were too high Maybe but I argue that's Disney's fault for marketing the movie the way they did. JJ already created intriguing mysteries that were changing he Star Wars lore. I don't know why critics are defending this movie saying sw fans don't want anything new. Are you kidding me? We've been waiting for something new FOREVER.  It's obvious that they didn't have a game plan for this franchise.  I'll still see episode 9 but I don't know if I care considering what they did to snoke.  The fans have been waiting for some backstory on this foool since day one and they trolled us. The worst part is they'd knew we'd be upset but did it anyways. I was nervous about jj coming back but now maybe not. If story continuity is synonymous with fan service then I'll take a fan service movie.  At least the fans pay attention to your story elements","true":true}
