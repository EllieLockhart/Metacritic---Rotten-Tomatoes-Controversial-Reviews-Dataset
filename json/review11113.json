Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hindsight is 20\/20. Having now seen the epic conclusion to the Skywalker saga I can safety say that this film is.... alright.\\nIt's beautifully shot and well acted. But ROS wouldn't have its problems if it didn't have to fix all the wrong doings of this film. Serviceable narrative\\, nothing more.","true":true}
