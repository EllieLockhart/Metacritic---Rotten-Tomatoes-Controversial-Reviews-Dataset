Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics\\, as usual\\, caught up in the advertising hype (the second wave of reviews will not be favourable)...Johnson has ruined a great franchise...silly film. Star Wars is about ancient lore\/prophecies and impending peril\\, not teenage angst. By throwing the lore in the bin and making Kylo the chief antagonist (who is not a formidable character) Johnson has killed the mythology of the franchise\\, that magic...that fear.... What an idiot. What was the OJ Simpson style car chase about?!? And Leah flying?!? \\n\\nSo you can destroy an Empire\/First Order ship just by crashing into it at lightspeed?!?what was the point of all those battles in the other films then ...such sloppy sloppy writing\\n\\nIt felt like I was watching a B-movie. Mark Hamill had it right when speaking of Johnson\\, \\\"pretty much fundamentally disagreed with every decision\\\"...yes replace the lore if you have something better\\, dont replace it for the sake of it...\\n\\nOh I do hope Disney think it's bots giving the bad reviews and are happy with the box office numbers....the box office really reflects the last film (which was decent)...and sure this film will make money\\, but it has done significant damage to the franchise\\, and cost a lot more money in the longer term...Star Wars is no longer THE franchise\\, its now a good franchise\\, but it has lost its awe\\, and that is something marketing cant buy....\\n\\nThink of it this way\\, at the end of Force Awakens\\, everyone had questions and theories....at the end of this nonsense...no one cares....","true":true}
