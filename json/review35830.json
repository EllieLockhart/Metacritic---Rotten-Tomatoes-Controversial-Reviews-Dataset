Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi is one of the best star wars movies yet. I don't know why so many people hate it. Don't listen to the haters the last jedi is a great film you should go see it and it belongs in the star wars franchise.","true":true}
