Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie so pumped with anticipation. I left going.... why did they do That? I feel like a part of my life has been taken from me. If this was not a Star wars Movie it would be a good movie. It just takes things in a bad direction. I can't explain without spoilers but it felt as if Lucasfilm did not have a real story arc set in place for the trilogy. They introduced characters that really served no purpose at all as well as project mystery that became something that was barely mentioned in the next episode. I just think this is a HUGE missed opportunities with this film and people will be talking about it for a long time.","true":true}
