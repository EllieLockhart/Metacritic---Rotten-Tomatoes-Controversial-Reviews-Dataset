Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fast paced deepening of the story line loses out to the shocks delivered as key characters are effortlessly despatched and great mysteries rubbed out seen as a snub to audiences. The story is interesting but may be a little too much for some movie goers who over invest in what ifs. At it's heart it still wins bringing the story back to the key themes of light versus dark and the oppositional aspects of the self illuminated by some great performances.","true":true}
