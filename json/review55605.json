Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing of consequence happens. Go see it in theatres because it definitely will not be worth watching on your TV.    \\n\\nThat is the best way I can describe this movie. There are beautifully choreographed action scenes. There are moments that will make you laugh and cry. All of this\\, however\\, is pointless because nothing of consequence happens. \\n\\nThe whole sub plot of the movie is a false start and it feels like it is shoe-horned in because they need something to do for the minorities they cast in the film. Like someone said \\\"We can't not use them\\, so let's give them something pointless to do instead.\\\"  I found myself actively hating any scene involving that sub-plot because I could sense from the get-go that it was very convoluted and pointless. Which is a real shame\\, because I really like Finn as a character. \\n\\nThe humor in the film is at times so awkward that it takes you out of the movie (I am looking at you Poe Dameron). However\\, there are some sequences that are genuinely funny and add to the story in a positive way.\\n\\nSome well-known characters die off screen and are mourned in a single\\, throw-away line. Some character(s) that should die\\, and come close to it\\, don't. But they definitely should have. Seriously if that character would have died\\, it would have saved us all a very\\, very\\, very\\, very groan-worthy and dumb (af) scene. \\n\\nThis kinda feels like a movie that was finished and good\\, and then George Lucas snuck in one night and shot a few scenes and edited them into the final cut of the movie. \\n\\nDisney knows that I and everyone I know is going to spend money on these movies. They have us all between a rock and a hard place. They don't need to make movies where we care about\\, or are rooting for the characters in the film. They can make a flashy movie that is boring because they know  that (I am) we are going to buy tickets to them\\, so the contents of the movie doesn't matter. \\n\\nThis is a movie without a heart\\, that spins its wheels and lightsabers for 2 and a half hours and leaves you wanting (a better movie). Again\\, go see it in theatres because it definitely will not be worth watching on your TV.","true":true}
