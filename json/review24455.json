Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More questions than answers. ***Spoilers***\\n\\nFin's entire storyline was for nothing\\, should have just left him in a coma. They really have to address Rey's parentage\\, I don't buy what was in the film. Kylo was messing with her to forget her past. Hologram Luke was stupid. SMH... waited this long for a disappointment.","true":true}
