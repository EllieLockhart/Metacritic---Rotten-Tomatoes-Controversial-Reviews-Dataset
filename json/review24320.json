Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Might be the worst Star Wars movie made to date.  Ruining Luke to try and force us to like the new characters?  And the new characters are hardly more developed at the end of the movie.  I liked the new characters in Force Awakens\\, but not now.  Why even have Luke in the movie to destroy his legacy in a meaningless way.","true":true}
