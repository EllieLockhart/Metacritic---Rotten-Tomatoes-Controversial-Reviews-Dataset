Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just what Star Wars needed! I\u2019ve seen the film twice and I have thought long and hard. As weak a couple moments are (the Finn and Rose storyline)\\, I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m in awe of the amazing things that did happen in this movie. Rian Johnson took a risk and it was a risk worth taking. ","true":true}
