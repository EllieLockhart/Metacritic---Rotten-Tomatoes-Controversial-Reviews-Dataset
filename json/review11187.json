{"101487":127798,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly did not care for this movie. \\nAll I hear is how The Last Jedi is new an exciting\\, it's not.\\n\\nMy biggest issue is that we finally had a Star Wars movie that was going into the grey areas of the Force\\, talking about how the light and dark are just two sides of the same coin\\, they even went as far as to show how the same people who supply the First Order also supply the Resistance. They were building this great new world where everything is not what it seems\\, then\\, they threw it all in the garbage\\, went straight back to the standard good vs evil that we've all seen a thousand times before (literally ignoring all the grey areas they just made and trying to pretend that they no longer exist). It doesn't really count as \\\"new and exciting\\\" if you only introduce new concepts but don't follow through.\\n\\nMore specifically\\, the overall tone was too light. In the theater all I could think was \\\"If someone says 'hope' one more time I'm going to throw up\\\". By the end of the film\\, the Resistance is literally holding hands as they escape on the Millennium Falcon while the big bad First Order\\, filled with all its evil stormtroopers (who are evil for apparently no other reason than you can't see their face\\, as usual in a Star Wars movie) lose again.\\n\\nThe side mission to the casino planet was an absolute bore and didn't really add to the plot at all. It took away from the gravity of the First Order pursuit of the Resistance\\, I never felt like the Resistance was in any real danger with the slow \\\"Imperial\\\" fleet behind them (Plot hole: There were more than enough tie fighters in Snoke's ship plus all the other star destroyers to have finished the resistance then and there\\, pursuit not even necessary). Nothing added more to the feeling of the Resistance not being in any danger than Finn and Rose being able to take an actual side-trip to another planet during the pursuit. If that wasn't enough\\, I've never seen more powerful plot ammo in my life. A First Order Dreadnought and Snoke's Mega Star destroyer\\, obliterated in the same movie without putting up a fight\\, ridiculous. \\n\\nFinally the Humor was non-stop and out of place\\, on the level of the Phantom Menace. BB-8 taking out a guard with casino coins\\, the porgs\\, Po's prank call...\\n\\nI've never cringed so much during a Star Wars movie\\, not even the love story in Attack of the Clones made me so irritable. This is the first Star Wars movie I wanted to walk out of. It's a shame the real Star Wars fans usually have to turn to books and games for deeper-gritty stories (Rogue One and Revenge of the Sith are the exception to that) and cannot treat themselves to a movie the way a casual viewer would. It certainly is possible to make a Star Wars movie that appeals to fans and regular movie goers while being original\\, but that movie is NOT The Last Jedi.","true":true}
