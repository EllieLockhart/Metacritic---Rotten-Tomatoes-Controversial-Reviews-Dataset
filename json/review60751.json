And not just because of Joel\u2019s death. If you\u2019re anything like me and you loved the developing relationship between Ellie and Joel in the first game\\, you would be sorely disappointed with this game. It\u2019s only redeeming qualities are the graphics (which I will give them credit for\\, they are outstanding)\\, gameplay (a little outdated but still okay)\\, and the soundtrack. Sadly it ends there. The main reason people play this game is for the STORYLINE\\, and a decent one was not even remotely present in this game. Why spend years and years crafting this beautiful father-daughter like relationship between Joel and Ellie just to have it destroyed in the second game? Killing off Joel so soon in the game was a horrible move\\, and a big blow to those of us who love Joel (which I\u2019m sure most of us do). To make matters worse the Ellie-Joel flashbacks\\, in my opinion the only good part of the story\\, appear AFTER his death which leaves such a bittersweet and melancholy feeling knowing he\u2019s going to die a cruel death eventually\\, by Abby no less\\, a character we are forced to play before she dies and after for a huge chunk of the game (and I don\u2019t even like her!!! AT ALL). If he had to die it should\u2019ve been later in the game when they\u2019ve established a real storyline because it happened too suddenly. Secondly the game is just downright depressing. It\u2019s not fun to play whatsoever\\, because Naughty Dog mislead all of us with that BS advertising of Joel helping Ellie on her quest for revenge. Instead we were greeted with a swift death and the introduction of underdeveloped and bland characters. And guess what? They all end up dying or abandoning Ellie at the end (surprise surprise!) where she is just fingerless\\, unable to play the guitar (her only connection to Joel) unmotivated\\, and depressed. Which make us players incredibly depressed too! There was absolutely no reason for this to happen to Ellie. Seriously\\, we spent all the time killing and killing so violently just to get to Abby then we don\u2019t even get to kill her at the end. It\u2019s like\\, hello\\, what was the point of all that then? And it doesn\u2019t help that I feel absolutely no remorse for Abby either. I WANTED her to die. All in all this storyline was a big risk on ND\u2019s part but it did not pay off. I\u2019m sorry but if a game leaves you feeling so enraged and sad it\u2019s not a good game. These critics are out of their minds\\, they are only reviewing it on a technical level and are clearly not attached to any of the characters or storyline like true TLOU fans. 0\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
