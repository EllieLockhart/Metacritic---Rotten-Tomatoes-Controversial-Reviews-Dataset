{"101487":147489,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will start off by saying that I understand why so many people are not liking this movie (hate is a strong word). However\\, that is not to say that I feel like people created their own disappointments. I think the movie did a great job of saying \\\"screw you\\\" to the whole bunch of blockbusters out there. Contrary to all Star Wars fan theories\\, this movie takes the franchise into almost entirely opposite direction in plot and character developments\\, but I wanted to comment on one thing for those who do not like Luke's character. I did not like the new Luke\\, Benicio Del Toro's character\\, Rose\\, and Finn's story arc. However\\, upon my second viewing\\, after catching alll the details I missed\\, my opinion all changed. Spoilers ahead. Besides Admiral Holdo's belated response to the fallen escape pods (I think she should've made her final decision to sacrifice herself way earlier\\, rather than waiting for multiple escape pods to get blown away) and Canto Bight sequence (which I think was beautifully done after my second viewing\\, yet I still think they can trim it down)\\, I loved everything else about the movie. People and Mark Hamill himself argue that Luke wouldn't do what he did in the movie. However\\, I like to point few things out. 1. 30 years have passed. Let's see if you stay the same after 30 years. 2. Some people brought up an interesting point; Obiwan trained Luke even after Anakin turned on him\\, but Luke gave up as soon as Ben turned on him after trying so many years to turn Darth Vader back to the light side.  First\\, Obiwan had no choice. Unlike Ben\\, Anakin was the chosen one\\, who turned to the dark side\\, contrary to the prophecy. However\\, when Anakin becomes Darth Vader\\, the Empire had already arisen and Obiwan went through the period of galactic jedi-wipe with Yoda. This allows Obiwan to put a blame on both the Emperor and Vader for the fall of the jedi. In case of Luke\\, who learns about everything Obiwan has gone through and who has feared the Empire for his entire life\\, he knows that it was Jedi who basically caused all this; believing in Anakin\\, training him\\, failing him\\, which gave rise to the Empire. Furthermore\\, when Ben became Kylo Ren\\, Snoke didn't go out hunting for the Jedi. It was that moment\\, when Luke sees Ben's future\\, when Luke realize everything is a cycle; Jedi training turned his father to the dark side\\, and Luke's own training was about to turn Ben\\, his nephew\\, to the dark. Especially when Luke lost his mentor\\, Obiwan\\, and his father\\, Darth Vader\\, because of all the crap about light and dark\\, I could see why Luke wants everyhing to end. And due to the impulse at the moment of re-thinking about all his past\\, he tries to end. And shamed\\, he goes into hiding. Unlike Obiwan\\, who had his apprentice's children to look for\\, Luke just got too tired.","true":true}
