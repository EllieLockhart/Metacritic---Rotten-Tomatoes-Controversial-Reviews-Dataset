Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is so disappointing on many levels.  Rian Johnson is a good filmmaker and the film is technically marvelous.  But this could've been the Star Wars film we've always wanted.  Instead we see one of the most beloved and iconic characters in cinema get reduced to a coward.  They should have called this film Episode 8: Luke Never Leaves the Island.  I was also annoyed with being beat over the head with an over the top feminist agenda.  EVERY leader in the resistance is a woman... even the squad leader! Every male character is a testosterone filled idiot\\, a coward\\, or a leader in the First Order.  I love strong capable female characters... but this film does not portray equality.  Too long.  Stupid jokes. Lame subplots.  But most of all... Luke Skywalker goes out like a little bitch.  Thank you\\, Rian.  This was a huge wasted opportunity.","true":true}
