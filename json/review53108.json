Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A ton of plot holes hastily filled in\\, and many left open. Terrible script and lots of random hopping between characters. Finn's journey could have removed completely and nothing would have changed. The love story between him and the mechanic felt contrite\\, forced\\, and too soon (3 days!?). Admiral What's-Her-Name could have saved so many lives by simply being a good leader and communicating with her crew. The cave scene and stupid and completely useless to the story. NONE of the characters grew or changed throughout the story\\, except Kyle Ren\\, he was the only saving grace. His believable twisting and breaking was amazing\\, I was beyond impressed by Adam Driver. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher's acting were both fantastic despite poor writing and ineffective plot building.","true":true}
