Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason I will watch the next movie is a hope  for redemption. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi did a horrible hob of story telling\\,  character development\\,  or following up on anything good from the Star Wars canon. \\n\\nNot the worst Star Wars movie\\,  but likely #2 in that ranking.","true":true}
