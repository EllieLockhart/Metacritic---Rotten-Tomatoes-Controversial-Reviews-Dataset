Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't worry\\, I don't need to dissect a movie searching for gripes to prove that I'm the biggest fanboy of all time. The Last Jedi is just plain great. Four times\\, FOUR TIMES throughout the movie the little small town movie theater audience surrounding me erupted in cheers and applause. I have NEVER witnessed such a thing in all my life. I think that says a lot about what this movie has to say and the sort of people it really speaks to. This movie is brimming with joy and wonder and hope\\, especially for an audience full of nobodies from nowhere. It was incredible. Perhaps the most enjoyable cinematic experience I've ever had.","true":true}
