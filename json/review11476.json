Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. Middle finger shown to all SW fans\\, actors\\, JJ Abrams and characters. The only 1 star for actors (especially Mark Hamill). They were good. One nice scene on the soil planet. The rest is absolutely terrible. Director doesn't deserve for such movies. He ended history of main characters without any respect to them. Since I loved TFA or R1 (one of the best SW films ever) I hate \\\"The Last Jedi\\\".","true":true}
