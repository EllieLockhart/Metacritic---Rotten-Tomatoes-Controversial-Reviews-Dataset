Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is arguably the worst film in the Star Wars franchise. It marks the true intentions of Disney clear\\, they prefer quantity over quality. I\u2019ve watched it several times in hope that perhaps my judgement was swayed somehow during the first screening but alas\\, it is complete rubbish. From the opening credits to the Jedi dust settling at the end\\, the plot lacks a connection with the previous films and leaves little to work with for the third installment. I feel saddened that such amazing talent was wasted. Rain Johnson should be ashamed. I would be embarrassed to have my name even listed in the credits. ","true":true}
