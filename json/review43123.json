Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this one was really boring. I don't like all the dumb jokes either. I was hoping we would find out more about Ray but we didn't. I liked her in the force awakens just not in this one.","true":true}
