Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story is boring as it is nonsensical.  Despite going into the theatre with high hopes and nostalgia from the past sagas\\, this segment in the Starwars franchise was nothing familiar to the seasoned fan and mediocre at best for the casual movie goer.  The story movie revolves around a small event (unlike the galaxy scale story that was Starwars) that seems to drag on for eternity while numerous of unmemorable characters carry on in side quest storylines that add absolutely no value to the main plot.   Adding to the already bad story\\, the writers couldn't seem to resist forcing in a plethora of gags that are terribly delivered at the oddest of timings - distracting and annoying.\\n\\nAlthough the reboot began with a generous dose of classic characters\\,\\n they are nothing but the same actors in a simalar costume playing a diffent role all together.  With no development carrying over from the past movies\\, the seasoned fan is left confused and disappointed at the \\nshallow portrayal of the characters they used to love.  There is little for anyone watching this movie to enjoy other than the soundtrack.\\n\\nI honestly couldn't recommend this movie to anyone as it would be a waste of precious time and money.  I am not sure how they could have made this movie anymore disappointing.\\n\\nSo\\, what about the new characters?","true":true}
