Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. Especially in 3d. Love the Kylo-Rey-Luke arc. The rest not so much. Plot\\, was weak\\, too many charachters\\, too many directions\\, thin bad guys\\, a MacGuffin that is useless\\, Duex ex plot devices and flying Leia? It was good\\, not great. For once\\, can I see a Star Wars film where some creature doesn't burp or fart? 30 minutes side visit to a casino was useless. Snoke was the new Darth Maul. Phasma was the new Boba Fett. Finn the new Han Solo. Yeah\\, the writing was that weak.","true":true}
