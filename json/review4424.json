{"101487":112772,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\nI usually don't review things\\, but in this case I'll make an exception. I even created an account just to rate this movie. I have officially lost any trust in RottenTomatoes critics' ratings. A 94%?! You're either high or paid off. Any critic that gave this movie a good review has absolutely not credibility\\, in my honest opinion.\\n\\nThe pathetic and shameless marketing and promotion (Nissan and American Idol\\, anyone?) and early \\\"rave\\\" reviews were indicators that this movie was going to be the worst installment of the entire Star Wars Saga. I never thought I'd ever get bored during a Star Wars movie and wish it would just end already. At its core Star Wars was always clever and witty. Perfectly timed lines and unexpected humor always contributed to the story or character development. Slapstick comedy made Episodes 1-3 terrible and made The Last Jedi even worse.\\n\\nNothing in the movie made ANY sense. There was absolutely no character development\\, no explanation of events (except for the childish he said\/she said arguments between Luke and Kylo Ren)\\, introduction of new unnecessary characters given a bigger part than they deserved (Rose)\\, classic Democratic Peoples Republic of California themes of anti-bourgeoisie and the poor treatment of animals\\, a schizophrenic selection of the physics of space (last time I checked\\, you get sucked out of a hole in the side of a space craft every time\\, not just some of the time)\\, and if I have to watch Fin wake up from unconsciousness breathing heavy one more time I'm going to lose my mind!!!\\n\\nHey Rian Johnson\\, if you're going to kill a character off\\, just freaking do it already! Oh wait\\, you did... to the one character that no one knew anything about\\, but wanted to know everything about: Snokes! Any explanation or back story? Nope.  Leia dies... until she doesn't and floats like a crippled superman back into her cruiser from the vacuum of space. Any explanation or even application of this extreme use of the force in the rest of the movie? Nope\\, and Leia lives on for a third installment. Fin's tries to sacrifice himself to the mouth of a \\\"portable Death Star cannon\\\" until Rose selfishly stops him. Luckily for them the cannon is spectacularly disappointing\\, only drilling a hole through a large metal door killing NOBODY! Luke takes on Kylo Ren and sacrifices himself to Kylo\\, Obi-wan style. Except he's there in spirit form while meditating from his hidden island and doesn't die. But wait... after the twist\\, Luke still vanishes into the force Obi-wan style with no reason or explanation. Probably the best possible move for Mark Hamill\\, though. No wonder he didn't want to do this movie; it's a stain on his portfolio.\\n\\nEverything about this crappy movie suspended my belief in what was actually happening on screen and the slapstick comedy just further drilled the nail into the coffin. Save your money and beware of the third installment of the series.","true":true}
