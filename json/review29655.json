Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson somehow managed to singlehandedly butcher the characterisation of every fucking character in this movie. This whole movie was a 2 hour shit show of rian basically jacking off to kylo ren's manpain. I also had to witness kylo ren's pasty ass\\, misshapen tofu looking body with my own two eyes and that alone deserves a 0\/5 star rating. \\n\\nOverall\\, I'm bitter because Rian Johnson has tarnished this triology and I'd rather watch all of Jar Jar Binks scenes from the prequels for 2 hrs than this disrespectful garbage.","true":true}
