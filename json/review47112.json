Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a joke. Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw and I followed the franchise ever since.  This is a massive middle finger to everything I loved about the SW universe.  The only reason someone would like this movie is if they were paid to say so\\, or if they appreciated the SJW angle\\, in that all the men are deemed unethical\\, incompetent\\, or just cowards\\, and women are basically perfect in every way\\, despite little or no training.  \\n\\nLuke\\, a childhood hero for many\\, is just a tired piece of crap in this movie. what a waste. All the ideas were just recycled from Empire and ROTJ.  It's not the Hoth planet\\, its a salty planet...bring on the imperial  walkers.  The emperor is played by some CGI gollum character who exists just to be killed by a conflicted dark side guy.  Sound familiar?  I could go on and on\\, but in the end who cares.  This franchise is dead to me.","true":true}
