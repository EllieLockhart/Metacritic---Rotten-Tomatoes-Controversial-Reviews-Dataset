Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ahh\\, what a mess. Trash. Thanks to Kethleen K. The best quote about this tragicommedy is  :\\\"What a piece of garbage!\\\". Good things are effects. Rest is insolting fans. Why Disney are stubbig themselfs by this garbage? Now I know why they eanted to buy this frenchise from Lucas. To put there political agendas. They did it so obvious and strong\\, that they tottaly destroyed this movie. Second terrible thing is no connectiom to SW univerce. Rian have no historical or battle experiencee. The movie showing death all over\\, but it is a commedy\\, with multiply of gags. This is not Star WARS\\, but Star BALLS. Third thing is How they treated Mark. Thanks to one poor woman.","true":true}
