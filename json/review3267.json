Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful Visuals\\, fantastic fighting scenes. Some fun comedic antics. And that's where the good ends. The story makes no sense and is in many ways senseless\\, and useless. No background on anything from the war to character's stories. New characters are pointless and old characters are rewritten and not in a good way. I just don't understand what the hell I watched\\, and that's after 3 viewings.","true":true}
