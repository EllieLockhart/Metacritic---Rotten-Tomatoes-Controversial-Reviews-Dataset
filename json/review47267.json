Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a shit show. Man this was just epic bad writing. The story makes no sense. The entire middle of the movie\\, during the slowest chase scene ever\\, could have been just cut out. Rose Tico's character has to be the worst written in Star Wars history\\, and Jar Jar set the bar pretty low. The humor was WAY off. There were literally \\\"your mama' jokes.\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell were they smoking when they made this dumpster fire.","true":true}
