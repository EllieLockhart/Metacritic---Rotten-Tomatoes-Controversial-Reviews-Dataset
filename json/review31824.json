Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Special effects and the 'feel' of Star Wars is the only thing appealing about this movie. Dialogue and story line was poorly written. If anyone can answer why the First Order couldn't jump ahead using light-speed then cut off the Rebels I'll shut up about how bad this movie was.","true":true}
