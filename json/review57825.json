Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted time. Almost all the things characters try to do in the movie end up being totally meaningless\\, from Rey trying to save Kylo to Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rose's side quest. Also\\, none of the character motivations are explained. Why does the same Rey who literally hates Kylo at then end of TFA do a complete 180 just days later? What happened to make Luke turn from the guy who refused to give up on his father into the guy that instinctively pulls his saber out on a sleeping kid? Why is Poe\\, who is \\\"one of Organa's most-trusted operatives\\\" all of a sudden a hot-head who won't listen and isn't trusted by any of his superiors? Why introduce two new characters instead of spend time developing the characters we already have? Holdo replaces what Leia's role should have been if they hadn't had her unconscious for the whole movie. And I could not care less about DJ. The attempts at jokes and humor were awkward and took me out of the narrative\\, but even worse was Yoda's appearance. I have so many more complaints that all amount to the same conclusion. This was not the Star Wars I love. This was Rian Johnson making characters run in circles with no regard for who they are or what makes a good story\\, let alone a good Star Wars story.","true":true}
