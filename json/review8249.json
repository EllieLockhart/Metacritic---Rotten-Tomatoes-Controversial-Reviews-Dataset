Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic! While hardcore fans can't deal that Vader\\, Yoda\\, Siths and Jedi are no longer around for good reasons\\, they will complaint forever. The movie is bold\\, messy and overwhelming at some times. But it's original and new\\, and introduce us into new Force interesting facts. Opens up for a lot of possibilities.. Yes\\, it has issues but most of them are minor things. Resistance and First order are decimated\\, nobody gives a shit apparently. So\\, no spoilers\\, but I understand why Rian did it this way. It's amazing.","true":true}
