Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad plot with some of the worst characterization I've ever seen. Slow pacing with some of the most ridiculous choices made by the director. Very inconsistent with the previous movie and overall really sloppy. ","true":true}
