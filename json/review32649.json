Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars:  The Last Jedi\\\" is hero story that inspires.  Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill are awesome.  Adam Driver returns stronger as Kylo Ren in Writer and Director Rian  Johnson's tale of redemption with nuanced sense of humor.  \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" awes and is heartfelt.  \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" redeem this \\\"Star Wars\\\" trilogy.","true":true}
