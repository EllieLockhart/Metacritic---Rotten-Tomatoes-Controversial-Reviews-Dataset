Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i loved it. It does so many things right. I've already watched it 3 times and its a film with so much depth that you keep discovering new things each time. Moves the star wars universe forward and thats something some people cant handle because its not going the way they think. my favorite of the saga along Empire.","true":true}
