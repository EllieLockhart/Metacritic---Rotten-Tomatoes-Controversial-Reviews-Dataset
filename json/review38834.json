Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They had the opportunity to make this movie go in a great direction. Instead they brought sjw mindset into the movie. The direction they chose made Rey into a Sallie Sue. They made Poe into a hot head. Created a subplot of capitalism and treatment of animals to the movie. The women are calm\\, calculated and center\\, while the men are gullible and immature morons. The list goes on. The movie was a terrible send off for Luke. Majority of star wars fans were entertained\\, but left sooooooooo disappointed","true":true}
