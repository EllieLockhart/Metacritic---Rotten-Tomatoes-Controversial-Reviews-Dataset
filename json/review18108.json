Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a good movie\\, but it was very\\, very intense. They tried to relieve some of the intensity with jokes. but it was hard to laugh when I was so tense. I assumed we would be saying goodbye to more of the original characters\\, and we did\\, which is sad\\, but it's time to move on to the next generation. The movie was just a placement between the beginning and the end. It was like the middle of a book. Unfortunately\\, we will have to wait a while to find out the ending.","true":true}
