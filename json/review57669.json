Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trashed everything that star wars stands for\\, for the first time in 30 years I'm no lnonger excited to see the next film. This film sacrifices basic character development and basic rules of story telling in order to create narrative twists. Some scenes were done well however the film doesn't hold up as a cohesive whole. This director used the pivotal movie of a trilogy to attempt to mark his territory and separate himself from the previous director.  Disney should stick to the formula it uses to find directors formarbel movies. It's sad that we will have to wait another possible 10 Year's for another trilogy . JJ Abrams is about to get a chance to show how talented he really is by salvaging this trilogy in episode 9","true":true}
