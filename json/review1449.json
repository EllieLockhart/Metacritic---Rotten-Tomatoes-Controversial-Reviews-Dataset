Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of Star Wars since I was 6 years old in 1977 this movie hurt my feelings. I have never before walked out a movie and said you know I don't even care anymore. Why do you have to kill all of the original characters to move on with the story? Why do you only have one Jedii in training? And finally why do you treat not answering questions from the first film so flippantly?. When I go to see a Star Wars film it like ordering my favorite dessert  and this time instead of the dessert I ordered I got a tuna casserole.","true":true}
