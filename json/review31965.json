Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers... \\n\\nVery disappointing use of Luke after all this time. Terrible missed opportunity. \\nDid you have to destroy absolutely everything about the best trilogy cinema has ever seen? \\nJust awful. \\n\\nIf Rey would have cried one more time it would have been every scene she was in. Where is the fun and adventure? \\n\\nAmiral Holdo\\, what a horrible look and dialogue. Yikes!\\nJust tell Poe the plan!!\\n\\nFor the first time in my life I can honestly say I will not go to see the next movie.","true":true}
