Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney build the trilogy up to be a suppose to be a story about the Skywalkers... and the story is now starting not to feel like a Galaxy that is far\\, far\\, far away. After waiting for decades and living in the canon stories of book novels after Return of the Jedi. This trilogy is nothing but dangling carrots for those waiting for a spark of our beloved heroes and the promise of a better story and circumstances. Where the other films made me feel part of the stories\\, I felt excluded in this one. Last Jedi just confirms without any true mystery or magic\\, Disney is just sucking us in for cash.\\n\\nCinematography\\, episode 7 & 8 are great to look at and entertaining .. but the story being told... I resent sitting for 2.5 hours of hope to just get it crushed while Fin and Rose go on a wild goose chase and the rebel fleet dies of in a slowest space battle I have ever witnessed since \\\"Jason of Star Command\\\"!\\n\\nI went to a late showing\\, last night. Out of curiosity and hope. Used my hard earned money\\, after days of all work and no recreation! But\\, was The Last Jedi really a new dark story? No\\, lots of shadows though! We still have no answers or hope. The direction of the film was all about making money. The changes in the direction of the franchise doesn't bother me. What bothered me is that it had noooo substance. All the build up to where Luke is\\, and the scavenger girl from Jakku\\, and the Supreme Leader making for a good story just fell flat in this film. Like a flat tire... fooled me twice\\, not waiting for a third.","true":true}
