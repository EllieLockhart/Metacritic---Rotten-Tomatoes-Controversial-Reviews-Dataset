Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to add an account on Rotten Tomatoes just so I can review this movie. People and Critics who say this was a good movie were either paid off or they have a family member that works for Disney or on the production of the film. As a science fiction film it there are so many plot holes pointless story arcs and fantasy that goes beyond the bedrock of a science fiction film. As a star wars movie Rian Johnson and Disney are clearly marking their territory\\, like a dog urinating on a tree. They dissolve any nostalgia of the OT and anything they built up in the Force Awakens. I don't care if you want to take it your own direction but don't call it star wars. this film franchise is lying to its fan base and Lukes statement in the trailers \\\"This is not going to end the way you think!\\\" is spot for the entire film and for the rest of the star wars franchise. \\nBottom line\\, its an ok film and a god awful star wars anything.","true":true}
