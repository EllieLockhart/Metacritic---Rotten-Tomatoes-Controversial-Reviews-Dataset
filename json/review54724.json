Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I remember when the credits rolled on this film in the cinema. I couldn't even speak. I didn't know what to say. I had never been so torn on a movie in my life. There were parts I absolutely hated. There were parts I loved. On subsequent watches\\, it hit me that this is a badly made movie from beginning to end. The overdone humour. The change of basically every character from TFA. The tone wasn't even the same as TFA. Something was so off about this movie. It absolutely tore apart the Star Wars fanbase due to its expectation-subverting\\, post-modern nonsense. We wanted a Star Wars movie. Not Game of Thrones. Instead\\, all we seem to have gotten with this trilogy is two dead OT characters\\, leaving alive the only OT character that's dead in real life. What an absolute travesty. The lack of any solid plan for the three movies has really bitten this trilogy hard.","true":true}
