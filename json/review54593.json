Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not trying to inpune anyone who loved this movie...art is subjective and everyone interprets differently.  I hated TLJ. The writing was terrible\\, the story disjointed\\, redundant in some instances\\, and anti-connonical in still others. For all that complained that TFA was too similar to ANH unwittingly encouraged Disney to overreact in kneejerk style and thus making a very different kind of movie...and in my opinion\\, not a good one at that. \\n\\nI could go through and discuss the myriad issues with this movie but I'll leave you just one.  Why would Luke leave a trail via pieces of maps just so they could find him to say\\, \\\"I came here to die\\\"? Only so he could troll the resistance? Nonsense. \\n\\nI mainly wrote this in a response to the folks at collider suggesting the bulk of bad reviews were being posted by bots and\/or people with an anti-star Wars bent. I'm 45\\, and have been to every theatrical release. I have purchased tons of memorabilia and all the movies\\, and will no doubt buy TLJ (in fact it is preordered). However\\, that speaks to my love and acceptance of the SW franchise. Disney has ruined that franchise in one fell swoop and I wanted my opinion known to them...thus this review. I accept this as unfortunately being the latest in the new trilogy but that doesn't mean I like it. The fact is I very much don't.","true":true}
