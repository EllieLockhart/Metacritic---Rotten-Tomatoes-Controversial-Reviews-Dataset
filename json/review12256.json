Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a  die hard Star Wars fan but I strongly believe this is the worst film in the franchise.  It completely lacked substantial character development and was riddled with amateurish plot holes.  This was a weakly directed movie with incredibly poor writing and an inconsistent tone.  I can't imagine this movie being anything other than a box office bomb if it hadn't been associated with the Star Wars brand.  This movie was a huge disappointment.","true":true}
