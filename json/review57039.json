Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film is a great next episode to the saga. the movie needs more than one viewing to absorb everything. the visuals  are stunning the action scenes are amazing and Mark Hamill steals the show every time he is on screen.","true":true}
