Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty decent movie\\, however not perfect. I didn't like how Leia wasn't the one to sacrifice herself kamikazi style\\, would have been much more impactful. Leia floating thru space didn't look great. I don't think it was explained why Luke left a map to find him which is flawed. Pratorian guard scenes were awesome! Snoke scenes were great\\, didn't think Rose crashing into Finn was realistic. I didn't like the Millinium falcon being featured again\\, too overdone. Maz's scene was stupid\\, the Cantobite stuff was justifiably criticized. Kylo and Rey's force connection\/projection was great! Luke's was cool too. I'm glad Luke died the way he died\\, very good send off. Yoda's force ghost scene was great\\, I don't like the political agenda they were pushing with Poe and purple haired lady. Keep politics out of Star Wars. Phasma vs Finn was pretty good. Phasma's line \\\"I want it to hurt\\\" was badass\\, didn't like when BB8 was controlling that walking\\, cheesy CGI. I wish Rey joined Kylo\\, that would've been something fresh and daring but they didn't go that route :(","true":true}
