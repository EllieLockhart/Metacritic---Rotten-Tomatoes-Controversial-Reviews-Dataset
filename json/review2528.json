Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A waste of time. Really enjoyed Rouge One which gave me some hope...but seeing Hammils acting and all of the feel good moments when 95% of the people were dying all around them...lol. there was no resistance just running away for 2.5 hours.","true":true}
