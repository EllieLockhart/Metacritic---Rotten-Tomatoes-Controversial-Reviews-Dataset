Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good visual effects & scenes\\, some saving graces. But so many glaring plot holes\\, character continuity & development\\, space physics\\, pointless scenes\\, pointless added characters\\, pointless hype\\, political agenda\\, etc. The critics are either paid off or can't tell good writing apart from just terrible s----- try to appeal to everything so that we can get more money writing. Holy f---.","true":true}
