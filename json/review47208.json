Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What annoys me is that the critics sold out on this one\\, 93% really? Way to sell out guys. This was a piece of garbage that undermined everything that came before it\\, and was a slap in the face for most of the original star wars fans.","true":true}
