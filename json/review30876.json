Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So bad. The worst movie of the saga. It is just a product from the dollar machinarie of Disney\\, at the level of worst movies from Marvel and DC universes. Just like Iron Man 3 or Suicide Squad. Don't go to the cinema to see it\\, don't waste your time and money in this. We deserve much more.","true":true}
