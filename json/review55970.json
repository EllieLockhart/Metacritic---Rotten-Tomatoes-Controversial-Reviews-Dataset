Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rotten Tomatoes does not count 0 or 0.5 star ratings in the total. Which they should. Do they throw away 5 star ratings? Of course not. Anyway\\, including the 1\/2 star ratings\\, the reviews from the last 18 pages (328 reviews) show a 36% audience rating\\, not 49%. \\n\\nIn my opinion\\, this is the worst Star Wars movie if you can call it Star Wars at all. More like a spaceballs spoof or \\\"B\\\" grade spaghetti space romp. Poor continuity between movies and scenes\\, inappropriate joke placement\\, flat characters and lack of character development\\, absurd plot devices\\, too many \\\"gotcha\\\" twists\\, too many subplots which were irrelevant to the story or led to nothing being accomplished\\, and too much soapboxing of contemporary political issues which will be dated in a few years. \\n\\nThe worst imho was the systematic tearing down of major beloved characters\\, deconstruction of core values of the franchise\\, \\\"leave the past\\, kill it if you have to\\\" mentality. Its almost as if the writers hated the franchise and couldn't wait to tear into it with zest and enthusiasm.\\n\\nIts hard to believe Disney and LucasFilm are that foolish to put out something as rancid as this under banner of one of the most revered franchises in 120 years of cinema. But alas\\, here we are.","true":true}
