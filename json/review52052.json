Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After my first time watching The Last Jedi I came out not knowing how I felt. There were a lot of unexpected turns and one character arc that wasn't the greatest. However\\, upon my second viewing I appreciated the film and the risks that Rian Johnson took. No film is perfect but that doesn't stop it from being good. First off\\, the characters were very well written and the action was choreographed to perfection. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley both give terrific performances as Kylo Ren and Rey and carry every scene they are in. Mark Hamill give his best performance of his career and Carrie Fisher is much improved over The Force Awakens. In fact\\, her performance proves that she can still act after all these years. Fin's story arc is a weak point in the film and slows the movie down a little. There are many strong moments in this film that you will remember for years to come. There are small moments I could nitpick but they don't affect the overall film. There's some comedy that works and some that doesn't\\, but again\\, it doesn't detract from the film. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone but this is a very different film from what I though it was going to be which might cause some to dislike it. However\\, if you go in knowing that this isn't going to turn out the way you think\\, you'll enjoy the story that was made.","true":true}
