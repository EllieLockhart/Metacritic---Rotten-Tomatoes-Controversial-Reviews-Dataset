Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film has so many problems\\, other audience members have already pointed out all the flaws of this film\\, can't believe people can say this film is better than even 2\\, 2 at least has a plot that doesn't pull terrible twists at every corner because it is \\\"bold\\\"\\, putting a grenade inside your mouth is bold too\\, just cause something is bold doesn't mean it is smart.","true":true}
