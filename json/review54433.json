Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like how Star Wars is trying to take a different turn in things and letting the old die. I feel people are struggling to comprehend this which is completely understandable\\, but I think this movie might get more appreciation after the 9th movie comes out. If people come into this thinking of seeing a dank star wars movie\\, then they are wrong. As a movie it is well done with twists and turns that will have an amazing ending in Star Wars IX","true":true}
