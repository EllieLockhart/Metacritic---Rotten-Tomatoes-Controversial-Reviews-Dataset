Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the worst Star Wars movie there has been. There are a few decent moments but not enough to save the movie. What is most troubling is there doesn't seem to be much build up to anything else. For the middle movie in a trilogy that is pretty awful. There is no real direction that makes sense to the world or characters which makes the movie lack. On top of that\\, new characters become annoying and old characters are ruined. I have to say that the trailer for the next one better look amazing and touch on a direction or else I will probably skip it altogether.","true":true}
