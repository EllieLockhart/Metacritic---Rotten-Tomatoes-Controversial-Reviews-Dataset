The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I managed to avoid the spoilers\\, and I intentionally avoided all the trailers\\, except 'e3 reveal' one. I enjoyed 'Part 2' as a game\\, but as a sequel to 'the last of us' I did not.\r\rFirst strike was when Tommy\\, in the middle of the fight\\, from nowhere decided to be a gentleman and introduced himself and his brother \u2013 a person with a secret so horrible\\, that Tommy swore to took this secret to his grave. And\\, quite possibly\\, person with a price on his head\\, after all he had done. And after that decided to go in a room with bunch of unknown\\, heavily armed people with no precautions. That for me felt very out of character.\r\rSecond strike was for the way Abby killed the man\\, who just saved her life. I have no problem with the fact that she kills him. Just the way it happens for me paints her as complete psycho and irredeemable person.\r\rAnd third strike for me where all those cheap\\, in-your-face attempts to show Abby and her friends as good\\, intelligent\\, compassionate people. Here's Abby saves a zebra\\, here's Abby reads a book\\, here's Abby feels ashamed that her friend cuts the queue\\, here's Abby plays with a dog\\, here's Abby saves kids even tho they are an enemies and so on.. Abby's part was tooooo long. I was done with it before 'day 1' ended. And from that point I just stopped caring about what is happening with Abby storywise. It just felt like completely different game\\, that I was forced to play for some reason.\r\rThe last part and the end were quite emotional\\, and I understand what ND tried to do\\, but it just did not work for me because of all the reasons above.\r\rAnd it's just sad and upsetting. Because flashbacks with Joel was great\\, especially the museum one and final one. Because I see all this incomprehensible amount of work that was put in this game! Visually it looks stunning. Hands down the best looking game at this moment. Acting and mocap are top notch. Game play is solid. Sound and music is great. Years of work. You have all components needed to make another masterpiece. And in result all I feel is confusion and disappointment.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
