Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly disappointing\\, a weak excuse to cash in on the quirky space movie idea that Guardians of the Galaxy actually did successfully. Bad jokes\\, bad dialogue\\, using great actors in bad roles. Got milk?","true":true}
