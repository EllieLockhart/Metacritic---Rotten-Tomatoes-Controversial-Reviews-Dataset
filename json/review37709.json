Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reviews for the Last Jedi are polarizing among Star Wars fans. This movie revitalized the franchise more so than the previous the Force Awakens. Rian Johnson sure did create a completely different movie than the others but it was refreshing. Although there can be comparisons made with Empire Strikes Back this movie also had some twists and turns that even the biggest fan would not have predicted. The visual effects were great\\, John Williams score was great and different than the previous film\\, the new creatures and locations looked beautiful. I have heard quite a bit of rumbling regarding pacing and character development but I did not feel that those two lacked enough for me to dislike the film. There will be a third film in this trilogy that will hopefully wrap up any lose ends. The story in these Star Wars films are told over the span of movies so I don't feel like this has to be explained in one film as if it were a one off.Overall I like Rian Johnson's vision for the new trilogy and the fact that they are taking the series in a new direction. We want new and not repetition or at least I do.","true":true}
