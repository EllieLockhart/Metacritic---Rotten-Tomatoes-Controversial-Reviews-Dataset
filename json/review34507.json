Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Best Star Wars movie since Empire! Luke played his role as a broken mentor and hero excellently. Rey\u2019s and Kylo has great chemistry with each other. Epic fights and sacrifices were made. I don\u2019t won\u2019t to spoil it but I\u2019m not sure what movie these nerds saw to hate on it as much as they are doing. ","true":true}
