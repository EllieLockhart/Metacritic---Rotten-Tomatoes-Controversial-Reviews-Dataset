Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what the \\\"critics\\\" were watching. This movie does nothing to honor the Star Wars tradition. Everything JJ Abrams did to honor the tradition and set up this episode was destroyed by Rian Johnson. It totally diminishes Episode VII to having no meaning. The plot is tremendously weak\\, as to is the development of the Luke Skywalker character\\, who by the way\\, fans have been waiting 30 years to see. As a life long George Lucas and Star Wars fan\\, I am angered and disappointed at both Mr. Johnson and Disney. In the Star Wars tradition\\, this movie makes Episode I look like a masterpiece.","true":true}
