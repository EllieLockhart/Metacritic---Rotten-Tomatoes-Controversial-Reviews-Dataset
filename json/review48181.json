Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually stunning on many levels\\, the story left much to be desired. The dialog\\, also impacted the acting. Several changes to cannon\\, holes\\, Leia floats in space but doesn't die? WHAT WAS SNOKES BACKSTORY? I found him to be very interesting but to have him killed off? I just hoped for\\, expected more","true":true}
