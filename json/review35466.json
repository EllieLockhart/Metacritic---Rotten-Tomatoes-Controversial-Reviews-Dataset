{"101487":175012,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi doesn't deserve to be part of the Star Wars Franchise. It shouldn't even be a movie. The entire movie is full of unnecessary action that doesn't make sense\\, plot holes that need illogical outside help\\, and stupid characters that have literally NO positive\\, constructive development at all. I'm pretty sure if you just figured out that the Resistance gets annihilated and that there's a stupid new character named Rose who seems to care more about Finn than what her sister gave her life fighting for (get to that later)\\, you'd be all set to watch the third movie. The tone\\, despite the destruction of all of the resources that the Resistance had and the deaths of nearly everyone\\, is exactly the same. Sure\\, they blew up the Dreadnought\\, and Snoke is dead\\, but Snoke wasn't going to live long anyway\\, and we never even heard of a Dreadnought before The Last Jedi. This is just an awful attempt to milk out millions of dollars out of an amazing saga. And when I say milking\\, I mean it. Luke literally milks a space cow in this movie\\, adding to the long list of crazy things I saw in this movie.  And then Rian Johnson decides that anyone who doesn't like this garbage movie is sexist? What! Okay\\, before people start attacking me by saying there's a ton of people who liked it\\, I have to point out that only 46% actually did. And then people point to the money this film made. I don't think you can point to that. The 54% who didn't like the film still had to pay\\, right? Or is there some new thing where I get refunds if I don't like it? Even Mark Hamill didn't like it!\\nThe beginning of the movie begins with the Resistance trying to escape the evil First Order\\, who has somehow found the location of their secret base. I don't understand the whole First Order vs. Resistance thing. The entire thing makes zero sense whatsoever.  If the quote on quote \\\"good guys\\\" are in charge for a change\\, how does this rehash of the Empire come back? If this happens every single time the \\\"good guys\\\" are in control\\, why are they even in control? Why not let the bad guys be in charge for once? All of a sudden\\, there's these bad guys\\, and there's also child abuse\\, slavery\\, child labor\\, and cruelty of animals\\, under the \\\"good guys\\\" control? So why don't we try letting the First Order be in charge? But anyway\\, then there's some your mom jokes. Which\\, by the way\\, makes zero sense to me\\, because in the expanded universe\\, Hux doesn't have a mother. I don't want to spoil some Star Wars Rebels EU\\, but that joke was a sad attempt to be Marvel. The entire movie is full of attempts to be Marvel\\, even in scenes that should be serious\\, like the time Luke chucks the lightsaber off a cliff. J.J. Abrams built up this amazing cliffhanger that I thought was sure to make a good second movie. Rian Johnson decided to just make the entire movie full of bad jokes that ruin the movie and make longtime fans (like me\\, by the way. I've been a fan since I saw the first film. Force Awakens was the first film I'd ever fully seen in a theater. And I loved it!) cringe. But I went a little too off topic. Then\\, after a ton of explosions\\, they send in some bombers to destroy the Dreadnought. These bombers are literally B-Wings that look like they can't fly. But then that pilot of that (I think) Resistance A-Wing made a bad decision and said\\, \\\"Bombers\\, keep that tight formation!\\\" Next thing you know\\, half of a non-functioning Tie-Fighter takes out 3 of them because of that stupid decision to keep them tight together. But okay. That's not the stupidest character choice we see in this movie (I'll get to this one later)\\, in fact\\, it's far from it! Because right after the destruction of the Dreadnought scene\\, Luke tosses what should be one of his most sacred items off a cliff!\\nOkay\\, more in depth about that scene\\, Disney flat out does NOT understand Luke. This is portrayed in the first two minutes of the film where they show him as a crabby old man who thinks the Jedi should die. I know\\, Mark Hamill\\, you tried to warn us\\, but none of us listened. The Luke Skywalker that we know and love had hope\\, and even though his father was the most evil person in the galaxy\\, he tried to save him. Now he lost one person\\, and he's some crabby\\, hopeless old man. That's not what Luke should be like. Luke should be trying to save Kylo Ren\\, rather than just wasting away on an island. The idea that Luke would do something like this is completely crazy! Luke's character is just plain misunderstood by Rian Johnson (same guy who called everyone \\\"manbabies\\\"). Luke should be working for the Resistance\\, or struggling through his failures: NOT sitting on an island\\, sobbing about his life story. BTW\\, does anyone else realize how weird it is that Rey is able to fluently speak Wookie with no lessons? That adds to the long list of things she can do without any training\\, challenge\\, or struggle in the film. And before you call me sexist\\, I'm not against the idea she's female. I'm against the idea she's a perfect Mary Sue. Disney has consistently advertised this movie as having a strong female character\\, not even mentioning the 50 million others that came before it. But technically\\, Rey isn't a strong female character. Nothing she ever tries is ever hard\\, and so she never struggles through anything. So\\, technically\\, she isn't strong\\, because everything is just handed to her.\\nThe scene then switches back to Finn\\, who wakes up wearing a bacta suit and runs around the ship. It is possibly one of the weirdest things I've ever seen in a movie ever! And then he runs over to Poe and they do another imitation of Marvel. Okay\\, so really quickly\\, they need to stop trying to be Marvel. In Marvel\\, we already know that the idea of two guys in costumes is already really unrealistic. So either they can try a semi-serious film or they can just be make a ton of bad jokes. But in Star Wars\\, we want to feel like it's real\\, not like it's stupid. So their attempts to be Marvel are not needed nor necessary. Anyway\\, he asks where Rey is\\, and Poe tells him... I forget. This movie is too forgetable anyway. Anyway\\, after that\\, we see that all of a sudden\\, you can be tracked through hyperspace\\, and pretty much all of the First Order arrives. The First Order launches some Tie-Fighters but not all of them\\, which makes no sense at all\\, and then they blow up the bridge. Leia was on it\\, which means she dies\\, right? But no\\, now with no training whatsoever she can fly. That made me scratch my head in wonder at how badly Rian Johnson was going to trash this movie. But don't worry! It gets worse.\\nSo\\, skipping ahead\\, Rose\\, Finn\\, and BB-8 go to find the Master Codebreaker. Nobody else could (supposedly) break the Empire's secret code! Except some wierdo is capable of doing the exact same thing. That made little sense to me at all. They infiltrate the ship but somehow\\, the First Order knew they were coming! Maybe shouldn't have trusted the weirdo\\, Finn! Next\\, Rey heads to Snoke's throne room. Some stuff happens\\, and then we arrive on Holdo. One of the worst characters ever\\, in my opinion. She is current commander\\, since Leia's in a coma\\, and makes a bafflingly idiotic decision to have a secret plan she didn't tell anyone about. Even when Poe threatens mutiny\\, her reaction is \\\"Not much I can do about that\\, guess your in charge now.\\\" NO! All she had to do was say\\, \\\"Let's sit down and talk about my secret plan!\\\" I mean\\, how hard was that? What is the moral? Blindly follow orders! Of course! Then we get to the praetorian guard fight scene\\, which is one of the worst fight scenes ever. Just look it up and watch it again in slow motion. \\nThen\\, Holdo makes that jump to lightspeed. Sure\\, it was a cool scene and all\\, but Rian Johnson shouldn't have done this. Now\\, if there is ever an epic space battle\\, all the Resistance has to do to win is to launch a one-manned-fighter at the opponent. And then we will just start launching missiles with hyperspace at one another. It ruins space battles\\, it ruins the movies\\, it ruins Star Wars.\\nFinally\\, we get to rehash-just-with-salt-Hoth-also-known-as-Crait. The action all leads up to this. But it just happens to be one of the worst scenes in the movie. First\\, to start this scene up\\, the Resistance literally copies the Rebels with the binoculars\\, the AT-ATs\\, the snowspeeders\\, the people filling the trenches: all straight out of Empire. Real creative\\, RIAN! Then\\, Kylo Ren and the First Order have this battering ram thingy that will blow up the blast-door\\, and in my seat I was thinking to myself\\, \\\"Okay\\, aside from the fact that they are literally copying Empire Strikes Back\\, this has some potential to be a great action sequence.\\\" No. To make a long story short\\, it did\\, but Rian Johnson goofed up and didn't include any of it. First off\\, you have the completely awful decision by Leia to put all those soldiers out in front of the blast doors to shoot down the Tie-Fighters. What are they going to do out there? Nothing! It would make sense to put them all behind the possible-to-be-breached blast door and snipe of the snowtroopers when they walk through the door. Then Kylo Ren goes ahead and says \\\"The entire Resistance is behind that door!\\\" No! They're all out in those trenches! Oh\\, he means Leia! Give yourself up\\, woman! Next\\, you have the Falcon scene with Rey. AARRGH!!!! That scene makes me so angry. First off\\, they try to get Rey to do an impersonation of Han and Luke when they shoot down those Tie Fighters in A New Hope (not even going to mention how unusual it is that Rey can shoot down three at once without any training)\\, but in New Hope they have just escaped with their lives. In Last Jedi\\, Rey's killing people and watching other people she knows and loves die. And the impersonation is her saying WAHOO! I like this! Yeah\\, she most likely would! She's not just a Mary Sue now\\, she's a psychopath! But this isn't the worst part of the battle. Next\\, Hux calls for all of the Tie Fighters to follow the Millenium Falcon! I get some of the fighters\\, but all of them? Not a good battle decision\\, Hux! Leia made a bad decision and you wasted your chance to take advantage of it! And then\\, Poe says \\\"They hate that ship!\\\" I just find it weird that they knew which one it was. After that\\, Finn is going to sacrifice himself for the Resistance. At that moment in the theater\\, I thought\\, man! Rian Johnson has some guts! This would fit Finn's character\\, because he has been debating fighting the First Order since Force Awakens! But in the back of my head\\, I knew what had happened before and I thought\\, \\\"It's just a trick. Rian Johnson doesn't have these guts. And then WHAM! Rose comes out of nowhere and head on nails him. Regardless of the fact how far back she was\\, and how she perfectly hit him\\, WHY? She makes some quote: \\\"It's not about destroying what we hate\\, it's about saving what we love.\\\" WHAT THE HECK! Okay\\, remember that Rose's sister gave her life for the Resistance. But then she's like\\, \\\"Love's better!\\\" And so she dooms the Resistance by letting the battering ram destroy the blast door for what? Love? That doesn't fit her character! I have to be honest\\, I wasn't a big fan of Rose to begin with\\, but this finalized it! Rian Johnson ruined a character! Next\\, when we look at the trenches again\\, all the soldiers are gone. We never see them again. Somehow\\, they disappeared without us knowing. Unusual\\, right? Finally\\, there's the stupid end of movie scene. All the Resistance died\\, right? But they're all smiling\\, patting each other on the back and celebrating! I just wanted to scream \\\"STOP SMILING\\, STOP CELEBRATING\\, YOU'RE ALL DEAD!\\nSo what do we learn from the Last Jedi? Rian Johnson cannot be trusted to write a good\\, not-stolen Star Wars film! If you want a good film\\, I do NOT recommend it at all.","true":true}
