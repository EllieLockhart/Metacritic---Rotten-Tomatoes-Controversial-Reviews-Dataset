Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hollywood is at it again\\, this time to destroy our most beloved sci-fy series. The only redeeming quality of Star Wars: The Last Jedi was the performance of the villain\\, portrayed by Adam Driver. 1.5\/5 stars imo.","true":true}
