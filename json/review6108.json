Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney ate Star Wars' soul. The original films were epic\\, mythic. They were a fresh\\, modern telling of the hero's journey\\, and spoke to universal truths in a way that touched generations. It's why there are fans 40 years later\\, and why most 10\\, 20\\, 30\\, 40\\, 50\\, 60\\, and 70 year olds have seen and loved these films. J.J. Abrams' TFA was a serviceable reboot to the franchise and story - a new beginning. Then\\, Rian committed murder. The Last Jedi completely misses the point. Rian's film doesn't respect or understand the original material\\, and there was no one around to help get him on the right track. Lawrence Kasdan wasn't involved for god only knows what reason\\, George Lucas wasn't consulted. Suffice it to say\\, had this been the original Star Wars universe\\, 40 years later\\, no one would know about these films\\, or care. What a shame.","true":true}
