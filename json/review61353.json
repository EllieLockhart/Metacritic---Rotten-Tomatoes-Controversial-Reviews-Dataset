LIKE ARE U SERIOUS!!!! like this is just pathetic its like they were trying to kill their own game with their own hands and they had a chance to fix this mess in the farm scene when u return to the moment joel was being tortured they could hv made everything like a dream but no they just had to ruin the incredible franchise and if they do a part 3 with no joel in it no 1 will buy it bec this game cant be called the last of us with no joel in it \\, part 2 should hv been about the last 4 years after the hospital scene only and see how ellie and joel relationship develop and ellie slowly starts to discover the truth and end it with that scene when she told joel we r done and walks away now that would be a great cliffhanger for part 3 and make part 3 about this revenge or whatever u were trying to do and dont kill joel this way make him die protecting ellie like literally when he fell on that iron pipe in the last of us 1 that would hv been a better death than this so this shows how bad this death is for such a big and lovable character to all fans\u2026 Expand","true":true}
