{"101487":147043,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very disappointed. It is understandable that they were taking a different direction\\, but it ultimately failed. They could have done a much better job with the twists that happened. Come on Disney! You are supposed to be one of the best story tellers. What happened here? \\nI will not deny the amazing visuals and music. But when it came to the character development and all those painful plotholes it just killed the movie. The longest and slowest spacechase ever chase ever lol. I will not even mention Luke's development on this movie because it was a painful thing to see. I get that on hos death he became one with the force and his corporeal body trascended realms\\, but it was very underwhelming. Humor is great\\, but also overdone for a SW movie. This is not Guardians of the Galaxy. Overall it feels like a prequel movie (like episode 2). I am hoping Episode 9 blows us all away and closes all the plotholes left. Also\\, give us a really good lightsaber battle or force battle. These climaxes are intense and loved\\, like the Obi-Wan and Anakin battle in Mustafar. Anyways\\, peace-out!","true":true}
