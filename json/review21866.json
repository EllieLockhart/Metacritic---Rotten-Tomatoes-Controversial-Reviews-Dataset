Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just loved the visual and all the twist in this movie. I'm a hardcore fan of the first trilogy and I'm so glad that Disney is taking the history to other ways instead than just keep with the safety and familiar story. It's the fresh air that this story was in need of.","true":true}
