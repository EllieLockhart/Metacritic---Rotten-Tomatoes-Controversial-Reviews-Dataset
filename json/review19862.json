Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was bad-disastrously bad in basic elements of storytelling while still managing to find time to betray the characters in a way that not only spoils Episode VIII\\, but now creates glaring\\, deep plot holes inconsistent with everything that came before. It may have also spoiled the remainder of the main (Skywalker Family) story in the Star Wars universe.\\n\\nLuke's character\\, one of two character's central to the main Skywalker storyline (Anakin as the other)\\, is done a horrible disservice here. I found myself mentally stepping out of the movie as it was playing to try and reconcile out how the Luke on screen could be portrayed so inconsistent to his past self. Would Luke refuse to help his own sister? Even when R2 tells him to help? Would Luke refuse to help any good person in need regardless of his own past? No. But here\\, he does\\, again and again and again in an infuriating\\, overlong loop. That's no Jedi-like at all\\, and as Mark Hamill said\\, this is not the Luke we know.\\n\\nVirtually every question posed by The Force Awakens that had us coming back for more goes unanswered\\, or is answered in a way that conclusively says the question didn't matter to begin with. How was Luke's lightsaber retrieved? Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? What the hell happened to the Knights of Ren? Where did the First Order come from? Nothing. All thrown out for a contrived\\, painfully nonsensical plot that forces in twists for the sake of having twists critics can talk about.\\n\\nBeyond all of that\\, I still don't know what the theme of this movie is. Is it \\\"Just ignore wise people and do your own thing\\, because what do they know.\\\" Is it \\\"Actually\\, please tell me the odds\\, because Han had it wrong and we need to think about this....\\\" There is no inspiring theme.\\n\\nI walked out of Force Awakens excited that Star Wars was back\\, feeling 10 years old and ready to take on the galaxy. I walked out of The Last Jedi counting the days until the next season of Game of Thrones.","true":true}
