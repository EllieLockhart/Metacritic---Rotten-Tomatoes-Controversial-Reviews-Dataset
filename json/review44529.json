Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To sum it up\\, We were betrayed and seduced by the Dark and Stupid side of Disney. .. highly anticipated The Last Jedi was full of disappointment but yet excitement as well. Luke Skywalker's character was hugely under performed by The Script it was as if Mark Hamill's character was being held back purposely out of jealousy and not used as the hero he is. relying on a new generation of Heroes to pick up where Luke Skywalker left off. Not allowing him to finish in a blaze of glory but to go out in a wimper. as if he was a old dying man who no longer mattered. full of plot holes and unnecessary Side Stories. would of loved to seen a darker more serious tone like Empire Strikes Back and maybe a Darth Vader Force ghost in human or Vader form. and maybe more Master Padawan training.... I'm so upset that this is the movie that will destroy the franchise\\, Rogue One got it right.. the last Jedi got it 100% wrong. ","true":true}
