Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So what is left is White Woman (Rey)\\, to be mentored by an older White Woman (Leia\/Kathleen Kennedy)\\, and assisted by a Hispanic Male (Po)\\, a Black Male (Finn)\\, and an Asian Woman (Rose).  Their remaining goal is to 'Resist'\\, humiliate\\, and kill the evil White Men (G. Hux and Kylo)\\, and turn the world into the beautiful future we all deserve.  Star Wars is now just the perfect Leftist fantasy film.  No wonder critics love it\\, but people (even with decades of love for the franchise) don't.","true":true}
