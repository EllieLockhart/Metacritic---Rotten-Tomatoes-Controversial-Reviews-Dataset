Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wait is Worthy....The Last Jedi was totally awesome.This is my favourite film in the Sage.That Mass Climax Fight Scene ( Rises Gossebump for a every single Fan ) is totally epic.\\n\\nOverall The Last Jedi is more than Awesome....","true":true}
