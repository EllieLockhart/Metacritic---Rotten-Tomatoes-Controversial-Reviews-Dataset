Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have no emotional stock in the original trilogy or care for any of the expanded universe lore this is an ok movie. I don't know where they go from here. There is no villain and no resistance. Too much left leaning politics infused in the movie to ignore. Overall the movie is visually amazing but the story is a disaster.","true":true}
