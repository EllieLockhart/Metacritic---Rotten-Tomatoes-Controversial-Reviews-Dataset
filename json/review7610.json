Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything I thought I would be was delightfully wrong. This is the break in the formula that the franchise needed. I recommend it. \\n\\nMy one complaint would be a moment by a primary character that was seriously out of character given previous movies. I haven't really gotten over it but cast it aside and enjoyed the movie.","true":true}
