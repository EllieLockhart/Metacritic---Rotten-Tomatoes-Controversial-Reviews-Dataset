Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Star Wars\\,\\n\\nbased on your potential\\, your force to bring people together\\, your ability to keep fans talking about the possible plot over two years and the impact you have on the culture\\, you failed in such a grand scheme... unlike any other movie before.\\n\\nIf this is your way to ruin the childhood hero of so many fans - Luke Skywalker\\, then we have obviously to accept it. This movie has no depth\\, more plot-holes then all movies (incl. animated) combined and takes no interested at all in any other lore or even Force Awakes just before.\\n\\nIts like you dont trust in the new and young fans to like something which has a deeper meaning then your regluar Marvel-Action-Flick. Disney and Star Wars has proven what can be done. Meaning Rogue One - almost a masterpiece. If you dont count the Money the 40 and 50 years old fans have at the Moment\\, you will miss quite a sum in the future..\\n\\nBut.. of Course.. it does not matter. Let the past die.. kill it. Thats your motto. Keep your Star Wars - im not interested anymore :)\\n\\nWL","true":true}
