Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Deft blend of storytelling\\, emotion\\, and homage. Revelatory\\, funny\\, and fresh. I'm amazed at people who are upset at what they perceive to be disrespectful treatment of material; Luke tossing the lightsaber is brilliant\\, and shows something other than what we've come to expect. As a fanatic since age 8\\, I was moved by Hamill and Fisher's performances\\, and by the great character depth portrayed by the new actors. Best by far since ESB.","true":true}
