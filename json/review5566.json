Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did I just watch a Disney kid\u2019s movie\\, a Marvel movie\\, or a Star Wars movie? I\u2019m not really sure anymore. Thanks to Disney\\, they\u2019ve practically become one in the same. It\u2019s necessary to watch as a fan\\, but the only respite comes in the last hour. ","true":true}
