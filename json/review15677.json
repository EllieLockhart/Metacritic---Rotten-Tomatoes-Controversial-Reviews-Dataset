Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie but... I'd have edited it better. All respect for Carrie Fischer but there could have been a better plan for Leia. The good-the acting was the best of all the episodes. Luke was awesome...could have got there sooner though. The trippy Rey sequence rocked! Snokes soldiers were a little Bill n Ted's ridiculousness. Fin and Rose - eh. Laura Dern's character\\, not so much either. But Rey and Kilo ---- yes!!! Totally awesome! Can't stop thinking about the possibilities! Come on! ","true":true}
