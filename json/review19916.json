Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was entertaining but I came out disappointed after seeing such great trailers I didn't think they would mess this one up but I was wrong. Oh dear someone needs to fall on their lightsaber. The film is a mess with pointless story line\\, hit & miss humour\\, one minute its great the next I'm pulling my teeth out\\, eeekk Adam drivers great and so is Mark but some creative boffin high up the chain made some poor decisions killing off characters that never had a chance to be developed. They should have taken some lessons from Rouge one a far superior film that has a story to tell. I think the next film Disney produces will have to call it Space wars as I don't know how they can right the wrong of this one. How did this get 93 %. Very interesting. Bizarre how it may seem I still enjoyed it.","true":true}
