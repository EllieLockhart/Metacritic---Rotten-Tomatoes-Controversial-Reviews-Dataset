Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had to make an account here because this movie has annoyed me so much!\\nI disagree with Disney's assertion that they were doing something fresh with this movie.\\nLast Jedi calls to mind the excellent S13E01 South Park scene where Mickey Mouse kicks the shit out of Joe Jonas.  Just re-shoot that scene\\, replace Joe with Luke Skywalker... and there you go.\\nVery very disrespectful to the legacy of the original characters.  It would have been better to reboot Star Wars without them instead of taking the Mickey.\\nThe movie looked good\\, but seemed like it was written by 8 year olds for 8 year olds.  \\n5 of us (40-somethings) saw this at the cinema\\, and two of us fell asleep half way through. This just shouldn't happen with Star Wars.  The franchise won't get another penny from me until Kennedy and Johnson hand the reins over to someone who knows what they're doing!!","true":true}
