Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry lovers of SW. I was at the opening of the very first one\\, yes the epic\\, perfect film that we all have come to love. I have seen every episode since and\\, sadly\\, this one killed it for me. There are so many gaping holes in the story\\, the script\\, the editing.....it is really incredible. Rey is fighting for her life\\, and suddenly she is on the Falcon. Ummm....ok\\, we\u2019ll give that a pass. Who the heck is this Snoke guy...BTW what a weak name. And Rose...come on. I\u2019ve read all the gushy things on the net but the part is questionable and the execution was awkward\/weak. Rey\u2019s purported backstory is a mess and that weird scene when Leila is blown into space and the does the Mary Poppins thing was lame. I could list many more things but am fatigued so will stop here. ","true":true}
