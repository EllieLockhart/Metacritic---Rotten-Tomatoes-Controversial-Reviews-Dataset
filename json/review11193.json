Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"honestly don't know why there's all the negativity. Saw the film in IMAX 3D so admittedly I got the maximum experience out of the visuals but I really liked that they changed up what could have been a very formulaic re-make of empire or something. Can't wait to watch it again sometime next week.","true":true}
