Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a hot mess. The issue was the plot\\, moreso the conflation of the various subplots and the quality of many of the subplots. There were some subplots that were explored spectacularly\\, namely Kylo and Rey\\, and somewhat Rey and Luke's. However\\, the entire resistance subplot\\, along with that utterly awful and unnecessary casino subplot\\, was just lazy writing and poor narrative. The entire movie suffered\\, in all of its subplots\\, from annoying gimmicks that constantly felt forced and unnecessary. These subplots were so spectacularly bad that the Rey and Luke story suffered enormously. It felt like it could have\\, and should have\\, been something so much more. It could have developed and polished itself to something that would have been a defining moment in Star Wars history. Instead\\, we have minor moments with so much potential\\, and Luke milking a sloth and drinking it while staring at Ray. Nearly the entirety of the Rey and Kylo's subplot was simply astounding and awe-inspiring. The movie suffered from glimpses of greatness and actual quality content mired by a dense jungle of extremely lazy and poorly-written plots. I felt betrayed that Disney would try to peddle this to me as \\\"Star Wars\\\" just one year after the spectacular Rogue One. I went in enthused and excited\\, but left disappointed and shocked. This was a mess. An absolute mess.","true":true}
