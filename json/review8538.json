Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, I am not a Star Wars Die hard\\, I am not nit picking every little thing in the movie. I am a movie fan\\, I enjoy good movies and praise them. That being said\\, this is a pile of poop wrapped in a Star Wars box. Sorry. It is bad. So bad that I began to reason why.. how could the next installation of the most expensive.. er watched franchise be so bad?? Bad writing. Bad directing and knowing that everyone would watch it. The fact is they did not sign the same Director.. yes he produced it which means he is off working on other things while someone else makes this movie.. I absolutely hate this movie. It is the cliche pass the torch...and not in a good way. Even Lucas could not have written this worse.. yeah its bad. Like just about everyone except for Disney\\, WE ARE DISAPPOINTED. Disney pays its critics well obviously.","true":true}
