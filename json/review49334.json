Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie to date. Luke milking weird aliens\\, tossing his light saber away. Luke was ruined in this movie. Rey's parents? That storyline trashed. Snoke? Mary Poppins Leia? SMH Another great subject trashed. So many bad parts of this movie outweighs the 1 or 2 actually good scenes.","true":true}
