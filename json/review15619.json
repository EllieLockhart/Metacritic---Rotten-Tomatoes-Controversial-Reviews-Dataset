Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie. My 14 year old son ADORED it. He owns it.\\n\\nI care more what my son and his generation thinks. They have taken ownership of this movie without decades of our baggage. My son at least\\, has a future of new characters he's invested in.\\n\\nI really don't give a damn what we old farts think\\, save any reflection our stupid vanity to be expunged.","true":true}
