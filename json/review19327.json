Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its not worthy of a 93%\\, and its not the besr Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson\\, and Disney gave use some of the best scenes to happen in any Star Wars movie\\,  but the dialogue was terrible. Luke the most energetic young Jedi\\, is now a hermit ? R2-D2 is in one scene. I dont want to spoil it. But if we expect better and more from Disney\\, dont watch the movie.  Rent it from the RedBox\\, or when it hits the dollar movie theater. Long time fans\\, be prepared\\, to see you fandom getting pushed aside and discarded.","true":true}
