Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi \\n\\nThis is both a typical and atypical Star Wars movie\\,  it zigs where it should zag but still manages to comply with all the things that people love about Star Wars.  It takes characters in new and exciting directions\\, which might be why it's so divisive among fans.  It's by no means a perfect movie\\, there are too many plotlines and it's not as tight story wise as The Force Awakens.  Parts of the story felt rushed\\, which is impressive given the film runtime.  Some moments come out of nowhere and are never given an explanation.  And for those hoping Phasma was going to have her moment to shine in this film\\, be prepared to be disappointed.\\nWhere the movie excels is in defying expectations.  Things that have been causing fans to speculate for the past two years are handled in an unexpected way\\, as if Rian Johnson is telling us that the answers to those questions are not really the point. For those complaining that The Force Awakens felt repetitive to the other movies\\, this one is sometimes drastically different. It does at times have scenes which are reminiscent of previous Star Wars films; however\\, this appears purposeful and those scenes seem intended to set the audience up to expect a certain outcome and then to pull the rug out from underneath them.  \\nIn addition\\, the score for this film is fantastic\\, as are the visuals and action.  Poe\\, Kylo Ren and Luke are all given great arcs and the actors are really given a chance to shine.   Lastly\\, the porgs\\, which people were concerned about are never used too much and are generally relegated to background\\, where they work.  \\nAll in all\\, a good\\, new take on the Star Wars franchise.  4\/5.","true":true}
