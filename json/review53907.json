Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How and why film critics gave The Last Jedi such high acclaim is completely beyond my comprehension. While this movie has all the visual and superficial elements of Star Wars\\, it really doesn't share the same heart and soul of the Star Wars franchise that I've grown to love and know through Episodes 1-6\\, Clone Wars\\, Rebels\\, and Rogue One... Beneath all the shallow window dressing and impressive visual effects\\, The Last Jedi lacks depth\\, lacks integrity\\, lacks continuity\\, and at many moments even dangerously meanders along the thin line of becoming a comedic satire of Star Wars. (Remember Space Balls?) This is not a film that leaves you breathless and excited to want to watch it again and again... At the end of the film\\, you're left silently wondering how in the heck hundreds of millions of dollars and all that creative Hollywood talent resulted in such a bland and mediocre storytelling attempt. I'm thoroughly convinced that Dave Filoni and George Lucas need to be back inside the fold to steer this sinking ship back on course...","true":true}
