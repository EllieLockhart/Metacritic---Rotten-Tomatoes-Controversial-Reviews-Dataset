This is a something more than just a game.\r\rIf you have finished that story and you don't like it - it's okay\\, no problem. Everyone has own taste.\rBut I hate that clowns who did not even played and gave 0 on metacritic.\r\rIf you are going to start playing this game I want to give some advices:\r1) Firstly you need to play original 'The Last of Us'. You need to play it again and refresh your memories if you have played this game earlier. Because the story of TLOU 2 absolutely haven't got any sense for you without first chapter.\r2) I'm begging you\\, pls\\, try to avoid spoilers. You even have no idea how it important is. If you have got some spoilers already\\, maybe you still don't know context and all can be not the way you think.\r\rAnyway\\, I think that everyone who love games should play it. No Youtube walkthrough\\, no metacritic reviews because part of reviewers did not played TLOU 2. You must play it by your own. It's very important.\r\rI really hope you will appreciate this creation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
