Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a terrible and incoherent mess of a film. The story was weak\\, lacking\\, and downright awful due to its numerous plot points and the poor decision making of the characters. The worst part... it drags on for 2 and a half hours... for nothing. Ask me about episode 8 and I can conclusively say nothing significant happened. \\nWorst star wars yet. Too many jokes\\, no good background\\, and the worst part? Disney wants to destroy 15000 or so years of lore to \\\"usher in a new age\\\". No!!!","true":true}
