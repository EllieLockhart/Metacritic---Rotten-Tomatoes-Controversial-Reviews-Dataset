Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disguised as a family friendly follow up to The Force Awakens\\, Rian Johnson\u2019s 105 minute epic perhaps delivers the most viscerally stunning and compelling installment to the cannon yet. Along with gut-wrenching action\\, The Last Jedi exposes the flaws and strengths of every character\\, to a point where every pre-existing notion of is challenged. Some may say it\u2019s too long\\, they may say it\u2019s humor is misplaced\\, but the truth is Rian Johnson\u2019s magnum opus is full of hyper meta layers with much more allegory than silliness. This movie isn\u2019t just about Star Wars\\, it\u2019s about morality\\, purpose and so keenly put\\, hubris. It won\u2019t leave you with the nostalgic feels of it\u2019s predecessor\\, but rather challenge you and your cinematic eye as it truly encompasses the meaning of an \u2018epic\u2019. ","true":true}
