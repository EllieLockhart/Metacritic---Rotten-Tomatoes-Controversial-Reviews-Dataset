Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who loved TFA and Rogue One and was confident with Star Wars in the hands of Kathleen Kennedy\\, I was very disappointed in TLJ. Nonsensical plot development\\, most intriguing mysteries from TFA are disposed of tactlessly. Snoke's origin? Who cares\\, dead. Rey's ancestry? Moving on\\, Kylo Ren says it's not important. I object to Lea's \\\"ghost mode\\\"\\, how being a kamikaze is the answer to every ship battle and to the death of Luke for no apparent reason. The First Order is reduced to childish buffoons\\, Phasma's unmasking is stupid fan service\\, Laura Dern's character is a military leader yet wears a ballgown... on the bridge of the rebel flagship and for the whole movie. Laura Dern's character exists for reasons of gender politics\\, we already have Rey and Carrie and Rose and a bunch of female pilots... do we need her? She gets shutdown by Poe only to be saved by Leia\\, so she's weak but a girl... female empowerment? I thought about clapping at the end to be polite but couldn't bring myself to do it. On the other hand\\, my GF is a casual fan and really enjoyed it so I don't think all the positive reviews are shills.","true":true}
