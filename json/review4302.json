Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Came in with an open-mind and then suddenly realized how inconsistent the film was. Tried too hard with a\\, \\\"HERE'S A PLOT TWIST\\, BUT HOLD ON WE WERE JUST JOKING.. THIS IS THE REAL PLOT TWIST.\\\" maybe 3 or so times. And Luke did not feel like Luke at all. (You'll know what I mean). The pacing of the film was a huge problem. I do admire their originality this time around but it was overall non-existent. Sorry\\, this one is complete garbage.","true":true}
