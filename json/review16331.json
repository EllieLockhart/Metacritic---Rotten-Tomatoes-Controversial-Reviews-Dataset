Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure why so many people seem to hate this movie.  Is some of the humor a little cringey yes. Is most of the Fin side plot unnecessary yes\\, but other than feeling entitled about or misunderstanding Star Wars there isn't much to complain about. This movie is good. It's original and takes risks. It's refreshing to see the Kurosawa influences back. Overall lots of fun\\, heart\\, and action\\, and all of that is what makes Star Wars not nostalgia and fan service.","true":true}
