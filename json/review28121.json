Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pointless side quest that does not add anything to the movie\\, nor character development\\, in which the characters like Finn show in full force\\, their inadequacies of competence to accomplish the mission\\, which ultimately having the droid singlehandedly carry them through their side quest.  moments of pure cringe\\, including most humor\\, that defy all logic and reason\\, a non existent plot\\, a lack of understanding of how the force and source material. Incoherent character development that does not add or reflect TFA. Worst fight scene\\, lack of compelling villains. This movie is 90 percent Disney\\, and 10 of what ever was left. Such a truly monumental failure and such SJW edging that left me flabbergasted it has Star Wars in the title. It gets one star for at least being shot well.","true":true}
