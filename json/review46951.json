Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We went to see The Last Jedi with 6 friends together and 5 out of 6 hated the movie at the end. One friend was not really a huge fan who liked it\\, she found it entartaining without caring who Luke was or became. Rest of us walked out of the theater very disappointed\\, it was the worst Star Wars movie ever for 3 of us\\, 2 of us hated most parts but enjoyed some moments. \\nWe went 5 adult ages between 40 to 55 and one 12 years old\\, he was extramly heartbroken\\, so upset with Luke's approach to his nephew and found Luke creepy sneaking while Ben Solo is sleeping. Luke's approach was not a Jedi way but a Sith way (Palpatine was telling Anakin that one apprentice killed his master in his sleep - that was palpatine himself)\\, he also compared him to Anakin in episode III\\, killing younglings. Luke was nothing like Anakin\/Vader\/Palpatine\\, that's why we loved him\\, he sensed the light in his father and challenged him to turn to light side almost sacrificed himself while doing so. Luke would never think of ending nephews life because he turned dark\\, especially while he is sleeping and without giving him a Jedi talk and try to work it out. He is experienced from his father\\, he turned him to light side\\, why give up now?\\nLuke was young when he faced his father\\, it doesn't make sense that older and wiser Luke would give up on his nephew. \\nLuke's character was badly written for a cheap distasteful twist\\, it was very upsetting\\, like Rian Johnson has no idea about Luke\\, he made him like a marvel or DC character\\, hero turned bad cliche\\, it was pointless\\, disrespectful to Luke's legacy and his fans.","true":true}
