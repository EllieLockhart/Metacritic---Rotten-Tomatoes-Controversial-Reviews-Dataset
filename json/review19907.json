Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was done as if the writer director didn't understand the concept of Star Wars and even basic character concepts. It would have been more satisfying if Luke went to the dark side rather than becoming a fearful hermit. That literally goes against everything the character stood for and because he had a moment of doubt? Critics seemed to love the artistic direction in this\\, but also forgot to critique the very concept of story flow and narrative as well. This story may have worked in another movie\\, but in one filled with space knights and space wizards going back and forth in battle between light and dark with such a rich history to it\\, it was not a good movie to tell it in. At least The Rise of Skywalker made up for the damage done to a cohesive narrative from this film.","true":true}
