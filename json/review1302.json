Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really great movie with some of the best sci fi action scenes ever. Unfortunately\\, it feels like it suffers a little from Transformer-itis. After 2.5 hours of non-stop explosions and way too many sub-plots and secondary characters\\, the movie feels a bit bloated and about a half hour too long. That being said\\, I think its the best of the newer movies they've made.","true":true}
