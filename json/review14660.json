Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have mixed feelings about this movie\\, but there was more positive than negative. I'll start with the negative\\, so that this review will end on a good note. The first thing I think of when I look back on this movie is the fact that it had too much going on at the same time. It was quite hard to keep up with and seemed a bit jumbled. There were also a few moments where the current plot line\/characters felt unimportant\\, and could have been cut out. Lastly for the cons\\, was my hatred for a forced relationship; it's not what you expect\\, but it is very forced. What I liked about this movie the most was that it had many moments that made your jaw drop; moments that were so cool that everyone seemed to hold their breath. There were at least six instances this happened\\, and I've never seen anything like it. It was remarkable. One of those moments is easily the greatest cinematic moment I have ever seen on screen\\, and I am dead serious. I would like to end\\, however\\, by saying this is probably the funniest Star Wars movie to date. This is my second favorite Star Wars movie\\, behind The Force Awakens.","true":true}
