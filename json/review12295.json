Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am really glad this is the Star Wars movie that we got from Rian Johnson. To me\\, this felt like the first Star Wars movie since 1980 that did more than just exist within the universe\\, but rather gave us a rich\\, bold story that plays outside of the already established world\\, as well as expanding upon it. This was also\\, in my opinion\\, the first film in the franchise since Empire that was really bold and actually kept me on my toes for most of the film. This is not to say it was without issues\\, but the brashness and strength of Rian's vision is really where the movie draws its power from\\, and\\, to me\\, that deserves respect.","true":true}
