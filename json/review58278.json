Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely beautiful movie. Great acting. Inspiring character development. Wonderful sound and music. Very interesting and compelling  themes and plot twists.\\nBut terrible writing and delivery. \\nIt managed to diminish a lot of the classic star wars themes in its goal of letting go of the past\\, and very blatantly gave the finger to many fans who had hopes of a grander theme\\, and seeing their characters act counter to their character\\, the complete opposite point of using a familiar character. \\nNumerous plot holes destroy the logical path and disassociate the viewer. And politics were pushed all over the place. What the hell? I get enough politics in the news - I don't want it in Star Wars.\\nBut all that aside\\, even forgetting my expectations and reviews and nitpicking\\, I just felt kind of disappointed at the end. I'm not really looking forward to the next movie. This movie feels like the end of an era\\, and the end of the story arc. The bad guys won. Everyone failed. And hope is nothing but slim and none. Not that that is a bad ending\\, but not exactly the one I was hoping for\\, and not a great one for the middle of a trilogy. Usually the middle movie is the darkest\\, yes\\, and the failure makes sense. But where do we go from here? What conflict do we hope to win over? It was clear in Empire.\\nBut hey at least it's better than the prequels!","true":true}
