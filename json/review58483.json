Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Alright\\, where to start?\\nWhat is dumb: -The opening scene\\, bombers are stupid in so many ways\\, none of it really mean anything.\\n-Rey's training\\, its not\\, and her solo lightsaber shit would get her killed by one decent fighter.\\n-Casino planet\\, all of it\\, its dumb\\, and a giant waste of time.\\n-Phasma\\, wasted\\, useless\\n-Admiral purple. A condescending bitch who should NOT be in charge of ANYTHING\\, literally getting most of her people killed because shes a moron.\\nWhat is bad: -Rey. Rey is a terrible character who cannot close her mouth\\, or really emote and is a helluva Mary Sue who can just do things....because. No aim\\, no ambition\\, no real difficulty\\, except for maybe\\, five minutes.\\n-Rose. Rose is a character that i'm just not sure why shes there. The most significant thing she does is teleport somewhere she should not be and nearly kill Finn\\, then kiss him. Zero chemistry\\, zero reason for her to be alive.\\n-All Military tactics. Anyone who has picked up a history book about war\\, read it for like\\, twenty minutes could outdo every single person in this film as long as they had average intelligence. These tactics and ideas are mind bogglingly illogical\\n\\nOVerall\\, this film looks really nice\\, sounds great and sucks in every other area.","true":true}
