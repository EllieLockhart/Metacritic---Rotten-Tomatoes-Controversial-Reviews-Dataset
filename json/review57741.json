Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very Disappointed.  The film did not continue to evolve the plot points from the force awakens.  It's like a separate movie altogether.  Poor character development.   Poor script writing.  Poor continuity in the story.  The characters have no arc to follow.  Rey has very little struggle.  Finn character arc is pointless.  Above all Luke Skywalker was tremendously disrespected as a character in this film.  He was reduced to a crazy uncle who wanted to kill his nephew.  In the George Lucas canon he was the most powerful Jedi that ever lived and we never got a chance to see it.  Disgraceful.  I am shocked this movie was approved to be made and executed by Lucasfilm\/Disney executives.  The is absolutely the worst Star Wars Film ever made.  A wasted opportunity.  I will not see episode 9.  There is no more integrity in telling this story.","true":true}
