Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. The characters were more fully fleshed out\\, the story was exciting\\, and most importantly\\, it furthered and deepened the plot of this modern trilogy. Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren\\, and Daisy Ridley as Rey\\, were both so well done\\, completely immersing each character with the struggles of finding his\/her place in the force\\, and from adolescence into adulthood. The throne room scene was hands down the best light-saber fight sequence in all of Star Wars. The music was absolutely wonderful\\, punctuating the ebb and flow of the storyline in the masterful way Williams has done with every Star Wars movie.  \\n\\nMost importantly\\, what TFA & TLJ accomplish and is so needed in Hollywood\\, is representation! Heroes that are women\\, people of color\\, and perhaps even of different orientations\\, are so important to see on the big screen. And these heroes  and villains are absolutely relatable to all of us\\, no matter our background. This is why I hold this movie up there with one of my absolute favorite recent movies\\, along with Black Panther. The latter a whole other review of superb performances and characters that appeal to all generations and backgrounds. \\n\\nI'm shocked by it's low audience score\\, especially rating this below the Prequels\\, which were unwatchable and horrible to sit through in the theaters. TLJ will one day be looked at as the perfect bridge between TFA and #9. \\n\\nI will agree that I am not such a fan of the Canto Bight sequence\\, outside of the character development opportunities it gave Finn\\, Rose & DJ. It did seem excessively long.  And yes\\, it was hard to see Luke's portrayal as less of a guide and more of an angry and forgotten hero - yet what a commentary on how we treat elders in our society. And what a journey his character traverses throughout TLJ\\, confronting his own demons and internalizing the importance of embracing failure. Watching the extras\\, including Rian Johnson's documentary \\\"Director & the Jedi\\\" as well as his additional commentary\\, helped me fuse all the pieces to understand his vision for this movie\\, and how it fits into the big picture of these characters' respective heroes journeys.\\n\\nI can't wait until the next movie\\, and have high hopes that JJ Abrams will tie up the series in a thoughtful\\, edge-of-our-seat\\, fantastic way that the Original Trilogy did for us so long ago. \\n\\nI am a big fan of the entire Original Trilogy\\, Star Wars Rebels & Forces of Destiny. Was not a fan of the Prequels or Rogue One (despite liking Jyn Erso).","true":true}
