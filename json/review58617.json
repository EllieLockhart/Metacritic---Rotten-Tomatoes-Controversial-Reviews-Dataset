This isn't Uncharted Zombies Part 2.If you want a sequel to be like the previous (admittably amazing) installment\\, play Uncharted. If you want the same game but new\\, play Halo or Call of Duty. But if you're looking for a new experience\\, a different take on your usual story\\, then much like the first The Last Of Us\\, this is the game for you.Don't expect to love it like you did the first one\\, it's a different game. The former is a simple story. Yes it was amazingly written\\, directed and visualised but it didn't require much thought.This one\\, however\\, isn't simple. It has a simple premise (get revenge) but there's many more layers to this that you have to understand; you should be putting your thinking glasses on.I finished the game and I didn't love it at first: though I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a lot of fun playing it\\, it took me some time to fully grow to love it as I do now and this seems to be the case with most ppl. After reflecting on it\\, you can come to like it\\, if not love it (the story and it's characters).\u2026 Expand","true":true}
