Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would rate this film 9\/10 for a Star Wars Film\\, though i admit there are some elements of the film that don\u00b4t land that well. What i can\u00b4t believe are this 0\/10 reviews. That simply makes no sense. I can\u00b4t believe how angry these people are because the film didn\u00b4t go their way. Overall I am really happy with direction the saga took to move forward. I find Kylo Ren a truly fascinating character and I\u00b4m really looking forward to se where this all leads to. So I\u00b4m giving it a 10 to compensate for this 0 nonsense (probably a 10 is nonsense as well but we really need a balance)","true":true}
