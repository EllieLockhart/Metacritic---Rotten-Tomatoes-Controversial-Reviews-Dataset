Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m terribly saddened to give this film a review so low. I really want to give it 1 star\\, but can\u2019t bring myself to do it. Pros: Rey and kylo....their chemistry together is the lone bright spot of the film Cons: everything else. The cheesy forced humor\\, the stupid divergent plots that serve no purpose\\, the premature death of Snoke\\, the disappearance (death?) of Luke\\, porgs (literally served ZERO PURPOSE to the plot)\\, etc. Very disappointed. The only reason I think it was critically received so well is because they wanted to like like it just as much as us fans did. This is a bad movie and bad addition to Star Wars","true":true}
