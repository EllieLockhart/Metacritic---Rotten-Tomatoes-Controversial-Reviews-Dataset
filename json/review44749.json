{"101487":190119,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash\\, no continuity with TFA\\, The Force is now just that a power you can use just because. Since Kylo did all the hard work she is just as powerful as him or even more. Just shows to the next generation of kids that you can be what you want without hard work great for this stupid PC culture BS. Kids nowadays think they deserve everything just because\\, this movie is great for them. Ray is another Marry Sue\\, 2 movies not injured once but beats everyone. what a great role model \\\"sarcasm\\\". Wish life was that easy\\, just great CGI with no plot\\, no connection\\, just complete ballocks. No originality\\, not a snow planet its salt. \\nRay is such an insignificant character because she always triumph without any sacrifice or at least difficulty\\, that I'm Hoping Kylo beats her\\, I feel he is more relatable than little miss OP Princess Ray.\\n\\nSpoiler Warning \\n\\nThe movie left of exactly when TFA finished but the rebels are almost dead while destroying the planet with a bunch of the 1st order did nothing. after revenge of the sith they killed of Jedi left and right and nobody ever survives in space\\, but Leia with no training flies back to the ship opens the Door and magic\\, nobody gets sucked into space. Then she is just in a coma half the movie\\, and people call that great acting. LMAO Chewie sucked balls\\, only here for comic relief so is Finn his plot is complete garbage. From Hero\\, in TFA to zero in TLJ. Too many how can that happen in the movie. Finn and Rose about to be executed surrounded by at least 500 troopers well 495 died in the explosion except you guessed it\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Phantasm and 4 other storm troopers. 2 again Finn and Rose right in front of the 1st order like a mile away from the base\\, Finn drags Rose to the base they never even get shot at once\\, in a freaking cocaine planet they never saw them apparently. \\nRay beats the red fighters 1st and then has to help Kylo who has trained from the start beat them? WTF. If that was even Anikan from Attack of the clones he could have beat all 6 of them by himself. Snoke died because Kylo is the only Jedi in the universe or at least the 1st to figure out he can turn on a lightsaber without grabbing it. that could have come handy a couple of times before. Look Rian Johnson is so creative that on the throne scene\\, Ray could see their ships being destroyed just like in Return of the Jedi\\, Kylo ask Ray to join him just like Anikan asked Padme in revenge of the Sith\\, or just like Vader asked Luke in the Empire Strikes Back. And so creative they all said no. Want to be creative Ray or Kylo should have switched. That's what I call unexpected. His creativity is that Luke is a Projection. How about Yoda\\, he can summon a lighting now that he is a Force Ghost\\, Episode 9 Yoda kills Kylo With a lighting\\, movie done.","true":true}
