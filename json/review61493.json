It doesn't sound so bad if well executed but first both characters play exactly the same and second the writing is on par with the worse netflix production\\, the dialogues belong in an episode of 13 reasons why and the plot is so stupid i wonder if any mentally abled adult took part in the writing. To this add that you'll fight the same enemies over and over again in setpieces that you've already seen in better games.\r\rOn the graphic side the game looks really good but doesn't run smoothly and often suffers from framerate drop (even though the game only runs at 20-30 fps and even though i played it on a ps4 pro ).\r\rOh i forgot\\, almost all the environnments are grey and green and look copy\/pasted except for the last part of the game (which was actually enjoyable\\, too bad it took 25 hours of watching paint dry to get there).\r\rOverall there could be a decent game in all this mess but it's destroyed by the pacing and bad writing\\, for every good idea there are 10 bad ones. Really to think that this took 5 years to make and had close to unlimited budget is embarassing\\, kinda reminds me of the rise of skywalker :D\u2026 Expand","true":true}
