When I played the first game I was very unimpressed until I reached Jackson midway through the game. I noticed the bond between Joel and Ellie and was bewildered by the attention to detail. No other zombie game really pays close attention to how an event like a zombie apocalypse can change a like-minded individual. Joel kills so many people before and during the events of the game it's ridiculous and it's all capped off by one of the best endings to any game. The Last of Us 2 is not as good as the first that's just not something it can be. It is however a very innovative game when it comes to the portrayal of enemies and the gore effects. It also nails the story I could really care less if you agree with me. Joel's death was an inevitability as one of the patrols his job is to kill all infected on his route and to identify and trade with other groups to keep Jackson thriving. When he and Tommy meet Abby they are forced to trust her and retreat to her camp because of the horde. As said earlier Joel killed a lot of people and it was only a matter of time before he crossed someone and when he did it wasn't going to be pretty. I say these things because common complaints are that Joel should have known better or he should've had a heroes death but there is no such thing in The Last of Us. Joel's death affected me probably the exact way it was supposed to. I've never been so onboard for revenge I remembered the people who did that to Joel and they were always looming I'd always hope I'd be running into them soon. Once I got to the Abby story line I was about as upset as everyone else I got to the chapter ground zero and took a break for a couple days and came back fresh. I finished Abby's storyline and as much as it's presence in the story is a blemish on the game the 2nd half is far better than the first half. What I would have done with the Abby story is make it an optional campaign upon finishing the game sort of like separate ways from resident evil 4. The end leaves something to be desired but I think it's fine. Please don't review bomb this game just play it if you feel like playing it and give it the score you would actually give it. Review bombers are a plague on the entire gaming community and makes it very difficult for some people to find a resource for whether they should buy a game or not and undermines everything the devs worked on (yes the ones who were on crunch to bring you the game as fast as possible). Before you say \\\"0\/10 is my score for the game\\\" this game isn't a 0\/10 not by a long shot games like Big Rigs\\, Ride to Hell or Rambo are games worthy of that score.\r\rPros:\r*Combat\r*Graphics\r*Attention to detail\r*Enemy behavior and personality\rCons:\r*Poor use of Abby's storyline\r*Poor ending\u2026 Expand","true":true}
