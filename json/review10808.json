Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hard to believe how bad this film is; how incoherent\\, improbable\\, and dull. In hindsight\\, the notorious Phantom Menace looks like a masterful lesson in storytelling\\, a jewel of character development.\\n\\nAlmost equally hard to believe is the positive consensus among the critics. Hard to believe that this what all the Hitchcocks\\, Kurosawas\\, Wells\\, Kazans\\, Spielbergs\\, Bergmans\\, Scotts\\, and Kubricks taught them; that\\, when it comes to a perfect film\\, the Last Jedi scores over 90%. Not only is this uncritical but also almost unethical.","true":true}
