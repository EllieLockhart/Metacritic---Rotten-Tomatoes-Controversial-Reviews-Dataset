Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyed this movie\\, dont care about who made it\\, why\\, if we deserve it\\, or any of that junk.  Simply had a good time in theaters and bought the DVD because to me its fun to watch if its on the screen.  Looking forward to see how it wraps up in IX.","true":true}
