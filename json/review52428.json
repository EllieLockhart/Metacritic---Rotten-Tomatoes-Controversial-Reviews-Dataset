Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie. Nice twists. Nice story. Overall a good movie.\\n\\nSome people might say it has not allot of characther moments...it does have those. And its clearly trying to separate its self from old star wars by bringing forward a new cast\\, and writing out the old one. It does this in a nice manner. Not force \\, but still leaves you a bit sad.\\n\\nA other point people hate is the plotlines. They hate that it has multiple ones. If you do not like movies with story ...go watch the fast and the furious etc\\n\\nGreat movie\\, bad fans","true":true}
