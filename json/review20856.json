Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 7 years old when \\\"A New Hope\\\" was realised and I can still remember it like yesterday. I have been a fan every since\\, I even looked for the good in the prequels (hard I know) but this is by a long way the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Come back George all is forgiven.","true":true}
