Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you're a fan of Finn\\, Poe\\, or Rey\\, you will Not enjoy this movie! Rian grossly mischaracterizes them\\, shoving Poe into the role of an impetuous asshole despite existing canon showing him to be the exact opposite. Finn\\, who shone as a main protagonist in TFA\\, gets relegated to a sideplot that almost every critic described as \\\"useless\\\". And Rey? Remember how Kylo Ren tortured her\\, slammed her against a tree\\, killed her father-figure (and his own father) and sent her best friend into a coma? Well\\, now Rey\\, at one point\\, holds hands with Kylo. So that tells you all you need to know about Rian's opinion of women.","true":true}
