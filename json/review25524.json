Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers.\\n\\nLook I've never reviewed a movie in my life here in rotten tomatoes but I just left the theatre completely baffled by this movie. \\n\\nIn this chapter\\, the flat humor found in the subversions is more important than meaningful development here.\\n\\nIt's one thing to not answer any questions the previous chapter set up (it doesn't) \\n\\nBut the real crime is when it tries to double down on the fact that what the audience wants to know from the previous chapter \\\"doesn't matter\\\" or tries to make you feel stupid for caring. \\n\\nSay what you want about the prequels... Im right there with you. \\n\\nthey don't feel anywhere near as lazy.","true":true}
