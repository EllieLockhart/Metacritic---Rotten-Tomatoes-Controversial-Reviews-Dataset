Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah it\u2019s different from the older Star Wars which I loved\\, but it isn\u2019t so different. The movie honestly had many enjoyable things about it\\, and some people are expecting too much when it\u2019s only the second movie of the new series. ","true":true}
