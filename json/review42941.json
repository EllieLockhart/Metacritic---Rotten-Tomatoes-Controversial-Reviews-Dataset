Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a let down. How can they give such a big project to a director who made only 4 movie in his whole career and his last movie being Looper. Are you freaking serious\\, Disney? Someone or how many were involved in making this decision to hire Rian Johnson as director and writer should be fired. Bring back J.J Abrams and fire Johnson. Don't believe the critics review for this movie\\, they are owned and paid by Disney. What a let down!!!!! ","true":true}
