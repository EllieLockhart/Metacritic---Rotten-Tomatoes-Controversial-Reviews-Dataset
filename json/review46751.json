Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well all I have to say is Kennedy and Rian should never ever be allowed to touch another star wars movie ever. The over all acting and visual effects we're great as always but the story was souless and forced and the attempts to be politically correct is stiffling just make the movie and stop trying to pander Disney. \\n Over all if your a star wars fan expect to be going wtf quite a few times and leave wishing for a different ending .","true":true}
