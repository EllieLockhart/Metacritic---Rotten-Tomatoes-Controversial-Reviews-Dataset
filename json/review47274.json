Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a soul crushing disappointment. I honestly felt like I had been robbed of my entrance fee. Such high expectations such absolute rubbish. Since Disney took over they were way to eager to push the new generation Rey \/ Kylo etc - I mean Han\\, Leia and Luke never meet up once in these movies (and never will again now) - the so called humour was cringe worthy; the Leia floating in space moment was groan inducing rubbish; plot holes everywhere - honestly the worst Star Wars film ever - as a long time fan I wont be going to anymore Disney Star Wars films. Whoever\\, green lit this rubbish script should be sacked.","true":true}
