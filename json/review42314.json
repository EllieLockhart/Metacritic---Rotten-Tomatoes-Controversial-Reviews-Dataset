Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes a lot of risks\\, and for that to happen to a franchise and even the Star Wars franchise is something special. However I might admit that the first 1\/3 (not including the first space battle scene) is extremely disappointing with some reveals that have extremely poor execution. Soon after the battle\\, some characters get sent on a mission which I'm pretty sure contained a countless amount of MacGuffins and some lacklustre world-building which is unlike anything Star Wars would ever do. \\n\\nAs I was watching these scenes on Canto Bight\\, I honestly thought they've messed this up so badly that it's unsaveable. However\\, the last 1\/3 is some of the most outstanding scenes that this franchise has to offer. The battle scenes are fantastic and tension is high throughout. The island scenes with Luke and Rey are also a highlight with some fantastic creature-effects as is to be expected with the franchise. I could make the point that this stuff was so good that I was disappointed by everything else but it all has to be at the same level and it wasn't. I think I'm nervous yet excited for Episode IX\\, it has the potential to be terrible or fantastic.","true":true}
