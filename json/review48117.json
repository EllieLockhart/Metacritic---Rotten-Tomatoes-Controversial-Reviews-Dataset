Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the moving itself is a fantastic spectacle\\, Rian Johnson has destroyed 40 years of character development and galactic lore and foolishly squandered what could be one of the be most epic opportunities in cinema history. \\n\\nHow is this kind of bumbling storytelling even permitted in one of the richest media companies to ever exist? \\n\\nIt's profoundly conflicting\\, as I enjoyed every second of the story inside a universe I adore. But Johnson's callous treatment of our character icons and the galaxy we love\\, is reckless\\, despicable and categorically unforgivable.\\n\\nThank god for J.J. Abrams. Only he can clean up your damned mess now.","true":true}
