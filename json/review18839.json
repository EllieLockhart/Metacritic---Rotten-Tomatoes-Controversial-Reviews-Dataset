Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an amazing movie with twists and turns you won't see coming until right before they happen. I have trouble ranking the Star Wars movies because they each bring something new to the table. Tentatively\\, I'm going to rank as just below The Force Awakens. I have never seen a Star Wars movie that I didn't at least like a little (even Episode 2 wasn't all bad) so I admit to being a fanboy. I don't know why people are rating this one so poorly on this site. I haven't talked to anyone who didn't love it","true":true}
