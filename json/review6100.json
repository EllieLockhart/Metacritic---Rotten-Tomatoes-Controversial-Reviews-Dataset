Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney and Rian Johnson has did the impossible.  \\n\\nI never thought Star Wars franchise can be killed in one movie.\\n\\n1.  Luke's character was completely destroyed in this film.  No longer a beacon of hope in the original Star Wars.  Instead we see a insane insecure borderline wimp.  \\n\\n2.  Kylo REN continues his child anger management issue.  As main villain has lacks depth and sophistication.  \\n\\nSo many plot holes\\, lacks flow.  There isn't even one character in the movie that draws you in.\\n\\nThis is the worst Star Wars ever made.  It's not even a good film let alone a Star Wars film.\\n\\nFirst time after film ends-  no one single clap.  Force awakens was such a great film.  The last Jedi makes justice league look like an Oscar winner.","true":true}
