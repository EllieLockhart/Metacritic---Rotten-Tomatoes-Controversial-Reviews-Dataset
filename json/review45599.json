Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing.  Smoke\\, Captain Phasma and now Benicio Del Toro's character have been complete wastes.  Worst of all\\, they took Luke Skywalker's character in a terrible direction.  The chase involving space ships equipped with training wheels was new though.  And it would not be Disney without plenty of cross marketing - who could have guessed it would be Mary Poppins.","true":true}
