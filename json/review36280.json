Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The lingering question I have after seeing TLJ is this:  Which movie is worse?  TPM or the TLJ?   Mark Hamill's and Daisy Ridley's performances were the only positive I can find about this movie.  Not sure if the story line can recover from this.","true":true}
