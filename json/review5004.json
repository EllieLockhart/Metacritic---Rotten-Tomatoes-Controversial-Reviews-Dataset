Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Count me among those who liked it. This movie went off the expected track and I liked that but obviously  fans are split. Not a perfect movie by any means but lots to recommend  it. Sad to see Luke go but what a way to go.","true":true}
