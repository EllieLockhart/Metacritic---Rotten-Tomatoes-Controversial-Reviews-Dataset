Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a long time SW fan\\, up to a point of exploring expanded universe. And i'm registering here just to put this review cause I had enough... What a ruin of a franchise.. It felt like new director just decided to cut any piece of story that was built by Force Awakens (not that it was any good either\\, but not as bad). Apart from visuals - there is nothing good about this movie... I can go into a lot of details\\, but to make it short: nothing happening on the screen makes any sense. The only way you can enjoy it - erase memory of any previous SW film\\, shut off your brain and blankly observe the picture... \\nHow it has 91% critic approval rating is beyond my comprehension.","true":true}
