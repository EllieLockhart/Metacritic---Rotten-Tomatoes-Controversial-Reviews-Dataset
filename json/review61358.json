The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"People are destroying this game without even playing  it\\, just because of a few spoiler. Do I prefer this one? No\\, the first game was better in terms of storytelling.But this one is awesome\\, we are looking at the other side of the story. Playing as Ellie and Joel makes us believe that they\u2019re the good guys. Long story short: in TLOU world there are no good or bad guys\\, everyone just tries to survive. Joel and Ellie killed a lot of innocent people\\, just like Abby\u2019s father. We are seeing the story on another perspective.Did I like watching Joel die that way? No\\, of course. I cried my eyes out because I loved his character\\, but saying he deserved to die in a better way is far from the truth. He is not a hero\\, he is a survivor. We would\u2019ve liked to see him die in a better way just because we grow closer to his character in the first game. Secondly\\, how can you say the gameplay didn\u2019t improve? And don\u2019t let me talk about the graphic\\, amazing.So\\, in conclusion\\, I understand that you\u2019re shocked because of Joel\u2019s death\\, I understand you seek revenge towards Abby\\, but in my opinion Ellie did what was right\\, she stopped the cycle of violence. I liked also the reference to the first game\\, Ellie saying to Sam that what scares the most is ending up alone.. that\u2019s the only thing I would change.I think she deserves a happy ending with Dina and their son. She\u2019s been through too much sh*t to be alone\\, again. Maybe ND could make a DLC or something.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
