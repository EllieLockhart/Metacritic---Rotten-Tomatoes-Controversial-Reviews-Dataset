Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This could not have felt less of a Star Wars film then if the Guardians of the Galaxy showed up halfway through the film. I had a fun time watching this funny sci-fi space action film. I laughed and enjoyed the mesmerizing special effects and cinematography. Like many other comedic action films this movie was very forgettable. Had no clear focus\\, weak plot\\, weak characters (aside from Rey) and gave us nothing to really be excited or look forward to in a film to follow. The Force Awakens had the very difficult job of bringing back some of the most beloved characters of all time and set the tone for a new trilogy. The Last Jedi could not have been given a better premise to follow. JJ Abrams gave us not only a good story to follow the original characters but also new characters to love. Sadly\\, this was handed over to the wrong writer and director. I\u2019m hoping JJ Abrams creates another dynamite movie. ","true":true}
