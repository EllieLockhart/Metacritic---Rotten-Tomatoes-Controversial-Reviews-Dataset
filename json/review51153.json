Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrific. It's not a star wars movie except it has lightsabers and characters but in no way does it resemble the original trilogy. In fact\\, the movie goes out of it's way to kick the teeth in of our beloved Luke Skywalker. I'm a die hard fan and I had such hope after the nearly perfect Rogue One\\, but this movie.... this movie is worst than Episode I. Can't believe this has happened. Still angry.Absolutely horrific.
