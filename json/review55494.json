Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest issues... (spoilers) 1. The character assassination of Luke Skywalker. This guy refused to fight his father \u2014 the most vile\\, evil\\, child-murdering despot in the galaxy\\, because he believed he could turn him back to the light side. Yet this same character\\, is going to straight-up murder his nephew\\, in his sleep\\, because he\u2019s been acting a little dark side-y. WTF. 2. Snoke. Not only do we get nothing about Snoke origin\\, or what he was up to during the original trilogy\\, but he gets taken out like a total imbecile. No epic Force battle with Luke\\, or even Rey or Kylo. Nothing 3. Totally ignoring TFA plotlines. Knights of Ren anyone? Rey\u2019s parentage? Rian Johnson wiped his rear with the script of TFA and served us nothing burgers. 4. The slow-motion space chase. Nothing else needs to be said. 5. Leia lives. They set up the perfect death\\, which worked out even better with Fisher\u2019s actual death\\, but for some asinine reason\\, she goes all space Jesus on us. 6. Finn and the new Jar Jar character doing... something\\, somewhere\\, on a casino planet\\, saving weird horse things while leaving slave kids in bondage and hooking up with Benicio Del Total Stranger and then... what? I\u2019m still confused. This movie was a complete waste. Star Wars should pretend this never happened and try again with The Force Awakens plotlines.","true":true}
