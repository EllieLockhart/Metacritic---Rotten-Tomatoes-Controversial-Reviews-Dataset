Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Putrid garbage. Not worth your time. Completely DESTROYED the entire story arc!!!Destruction of customs and tradition - Yoda burning the Jedi Order books (destroying religion).\\nLuke throwing the light saber away. \\nConstant message to \\\"kill the past.\\\"\\nThe overall message is that the universe is meaningless. \\n\\nDestruction of family - Rays family end up being nobodies who sold her for drinking money. But since Ray is awesome at everything she does\\, the messsage is that families are not important to the success of a person which is moronic. That expanation also does not explain WHY Rey is so powerful. At least if she were related to Luke then that would partially explain it. \\n\\nDestruction of fatherhood: Luke is made to look like an idiot. Of course Ray bests him and knocks him to the ground and decides to spare him. \\n\\nGirls can do anything\\n\\nGirls don't have to train to be really great at something. They can just DO whatever they want. \\n\\nMen are stupid\\n\\nMen can only think about blowing things up\\n\\nFamilies don't matter. Blood doesn't matter. You can do anything you want. \\n\\nMixed messages- we are supposed to believe that a patricidal character deserves our sympathy. Another example of Hollywood trying to confuse people so they can't discern between good and evil.","true":true}
