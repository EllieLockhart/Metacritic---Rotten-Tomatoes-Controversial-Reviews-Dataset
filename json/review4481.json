Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Character development is the driving force of this film (forgive the pun) - there's a lot to love about this movie\\, but die-hards married to the originals will be less likely to accept some of the changes Rian has made. This film - oof. I cried more during The Last Jedi than I have at most funerals. Be warned that this one will find whatever heartstrings you have.... whatever nostalgia you hold dear - and will tug mercilessly until the end credits.","true":true}
