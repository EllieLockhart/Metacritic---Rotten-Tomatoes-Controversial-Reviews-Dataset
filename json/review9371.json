Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ghastly\\, heinously bad. muddled plot\\, flat characters\\, bad acting\\, eye-rollingly stupid clich\u00e9d dialog. Disney poisons everything they touch. long gone is the star wars magic. this film should be taken out to the woods\\, shot and put out of its pathetic misery.","true":true}
