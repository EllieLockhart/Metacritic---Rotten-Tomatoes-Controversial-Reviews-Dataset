Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As somebody else said\\, this truly is Social Justice Wars. What GARBAGE! Attention everyone\\, all these \\\"professional\\\" critics giving it high marks.... you know what kind of people these are so are you really shocked they're falling over themselves with the high scores? Episode IV and Empire Strikes Back were the only two films from this saga worth spit. I only saw this movie because a friend won tickets in a blind raffle and once he found out the tickets were for Star Wars\\, he was about to throw them in the garbage and wanted to know if I'd like them. Since I had nothing else better to do today\\, and was happy that my money wasn't going to support this\\, I went. I mean\\, who doesn't like see a train wreck in slow motion?\\n\\nAnd it was exactly what I expected it to be. Just like episodes 1\\, 2 and 3..... horrible acting\\, sloppy writing\\, pointless scenes. I'm just blown away with how utterly crappy this movie is. It doesn't help that Daisy Ridley can't give a single interview without puking forth every SJW agenda talking point. Also\\, John Boyega is a lousy actor but hey\\, JJ Abrams looked around the room and saw too many white people so John got the part. (How does that make you feel John\\, hired because of your skin color and nothing more?) Adam Driver...... how do you not laugh at the script your given? Guess you need to keep food on the table\\, that's how.\\n\\nDisney is well on their way to trashing what little hope we all had for an amazing Star Wars legacy. LOL\\, Social Justice Wars indeed!","true":true}
