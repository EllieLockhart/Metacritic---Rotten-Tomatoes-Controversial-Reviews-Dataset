Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sizable number of fans had but only two humble requests for TLJ: don't kill Luke in his much anticipated return since RoTJ and don't make him appear so pathetic that he is barely recognizable. Sadly\\, Rian Johnson egregiously failed on both accounts by being\\, ironically\\, predictable. Besides whining endlessly and marinating in his own misery\\, Luke never made it off the island; in fact\\, he succumb after using \\\"Force Projection\\\" in which he defeated no one of significance except his own shadow. Honestly\\, if I had no other option\\, I would much rather he died killing Snoke or defeating the Knights of Ren than suffering such a pointless demise. Yes\\, hindsight is 20\/20 and you can't make everyone happy\\, but this is clearly self-evident to both casual and rabid Star Wars followers. Fans are drawn to Star Wars for a variety of reasons and Luke Skywalker was arguably the most revered\\, galvanizing character of all. \\n\\nIf Rian wanted extreme character arcs\\, unlike the steadfast convictions of say Yoda or Obi-Wan\\, he should have looked elsewhere. His obvious penchant for stunning plot twists would have been much more well received without the extreme character regression of such a beloved icon. Instead\\, he gave far more respect to an untrained Rey and the hopelessly bipolar Kylo...whom I too enjoy and recognize as the future of the franchise. Many fans are rightfully disappointed for the same reasons Mark Hamill disagreed with much of the script: it fundamentally conflicted with Luke's ethos and legacy. It's really that simple and no different than turning Harry Potter into a bitter hermit who abandons the fight against evil and renounces the use of magic. In other words\\, there's a stark difference between questioning yourself\\, the harsh inequities of life\\, and completely losing your damn mind.","true":true}
