Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible... I went to this movie believing that no movie can be worst than Star Wars: The Force Awakens... Well they got me\\, they managed the impossible: a movie worst than Episode VII. \\nI honestly can't think of anything positive about the movie. If I think of it more\\, what I watched was not a Star Wars movie... It was a SF movie\\, there were some people talking about some Force and using some light sabers. However\\, these Force gifted people with no training could easily shame any Jedi Master from the previous movies. And about the light saber fights?! Well apparently anyone can fight with one\\, just use it as a shovel\\, or a bat... I mean that is what Finn did in Ep VII and what Rey is doing in Ep VIII.\\nAnd there would be a lot more to say but I just wanted to underline how they managed to destroy the 2 constant things that appeared in SW movies. \\nAs said before this was a SF movie but not Star Wars\\, a movie made around SJW ideas and not the Force\\, not about the constant battle between good and evil\\, the dark side and the light. \\nWon't be making the mistake of seeing Episode IX...","true":true}
