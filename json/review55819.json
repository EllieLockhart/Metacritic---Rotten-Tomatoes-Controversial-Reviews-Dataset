Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Positives: Incredible cast. Mark Hamill on screen was great. The conflict portrayed in Kylo Ren done very well. Some good moments. Negatives: All the missed opportunities and pointless subplots. Felt like it was made by someone more focused on their sole vision as a director instead of someone passionate about maintaining the integrity of this piece of cinema history. Overall: I left the theater initially wanting to like the film... and almost forcing myself to like it. However\\, the more I dwelled on it\\, I realized that the negatives outweighed the positives when it came to this film. There are so many great characters and so much potential to play with - but instead.... just missed opportunity after missed opportunity. Update: I\u2019ve had a couple weeks to digest this film... Disney has murdered Star Wars. This is THE absolute worst Star Wars film ever made. The Last Jedi is a disgrace. Rian Johnson... wow. If I could give it 0 out of 5 stars... I would.","true":true}
