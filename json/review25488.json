Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No se de que pol\u00e9mica hablan los supuestos fans\\, a mi me pareci\u00f3 grandiosa tiene unas escenas \u00e9picas incre\u00edbles\\, por momentos es tensa\\,  visualmente es hermosa  y ese \\\"diferente a las otras\\\" es un gran aporte. Es que esa moda de ser hater si que es ineficiente.","true":false}
