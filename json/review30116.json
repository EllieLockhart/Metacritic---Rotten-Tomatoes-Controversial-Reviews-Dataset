Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly the parts I liked the most had none of the original Characteres in it\\, and wre all the new characters. Except Chewie who I still loved..  But Rei\\, Luke\\, and Kylo all had no soul\\, and honeslty felt like there were written by someone who was just writing what they thought should happen\\, rather then coming from a personal place that showed real humanity.  IT was wooden at best\\, souless fake depth far too often.  However giving it three stars for the moments when some of the other characters made me have nestalgia and felt like they were back in that original Fighter bay\\, or magical world with amazing creatures.  Can understand why die hard fans were hard on it though\\, it definitely lacked any real continuation of the characters outline in the original three movies.  Luke would never be that jaded\\, it was against everything that made him luke.  WIth that niave hope\\, he feels like a joke.","true":true}
