Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics score 93%. Audience score 56% and will go down some more. I am with the audience for this one. While trying to reinvent Starwars\\, Disney made a mess. Going from the Skywalker saga to a nobody is a blunder. As Mark Hamil said\\, they should have taken story advice from George Lucas. This new trilogy is worse than the prequels.","true":true}
