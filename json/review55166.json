Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with no expectations\\, having only seen two reviews\\, one good and one bad\\, and having avoid fan theories.  The biggest let down of this movie is you can see the potential for greatness only for it to settle for mediocrity\\, the pacing is completely off\\, drawing out scenes for far longer than necessary\\, the dialogue is barely b-list movie quality\\, the plot while having potential is failed by the writing\\, and the character development is practically nonexistent.  The only reason I didn't give it a lower score is that Attack of the clones is arguably worse in all above listed categories.","true":true}
