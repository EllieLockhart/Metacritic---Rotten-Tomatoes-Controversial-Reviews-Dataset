Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half of the movie was a complete disaster.  The second half was really entertaining\\, creative and typical Star Wars fun.  I wanted to love this movie\\, but the storyline was so disjointed.","true":true}
