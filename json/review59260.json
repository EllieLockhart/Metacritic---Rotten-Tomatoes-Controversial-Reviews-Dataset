The gameplay\\, locations\\, and visual design are supremely engaging\\, and so is the story. Be wary of the many negative reviews\\, the story is bleak and upsetting for sure but that is its purpose and intention. It is quite naive and immature to assume that in a deadly post-apocalyptic world that people will behave rationally\\, morally\\, or even kindly to one another\\, and this poignant story explores those perspectives and themes. Many of these review bombers are simply upset that a beloved\\, albeit\\, selfish character is killed off early on (despite the fact that death is an increased reality of this game world and that death is the reality of our world too) refuse to give the game any credence thereafter. Many more are also deeply bigoted despite their claims that the \u2018writing is just bad\u2019. The game champions a queer hero (who has always been queer since the first game) and a trans character later on who actually fits into and serves the story. These diverse characters are lifted up by an ethnically diverse cast too which feels correct in today\u2019s world. Notions that this game is pandering to queer people\\, women\\, and people of colour as a political message (when these diverse people are already existent in our real world) are completely biased and hateful. Especially the \u2018joke\u2019 that a certain character is unclearly a man or a woman because of their physique is transphobic and sexist. Please ignore these reviews and enjoy the game for what it is and keep an open mind. In saying all this\\, my only criticisms of the game is that for a story about revenge and violence it really ought to have a reward system for sacrificing your enemies\\, and there are also a few small moments where the great illusion of immersion are broken simply because the game tries so hard to be immersive (see\\, swimming underwater with a backpack full of notes and journals and gunpowder). It seems also that the west especially is not used to seeing their heroes fail\\, lose or regress\\, but this is all a part of the brutal but excellent reality that is the Last of Us Part II.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
