Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great story\\, really made the force less binary (light\/dark) and more relatable and interesting. Glad to see they aren't just recycling the same old tired tropes of Star Wars (not that they are bad\\, I just couldn't take another trilogy of them) and are heading in a bold new direction. Could care less if other people don't like it\\, I really enjoyed it.","true":true}
