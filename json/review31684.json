Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry - It has nothing to do with the resistance to change or \\\"not wanting something new.\\\"  It terrible plotting\\, lack of editing\\, trite dialogue\\, and wildly inappropriate humor is some kind of new standard by which I must judge movies - then maybe I haven't seen enough Disney films to know \\\"what a good film\\\" should be.  Of course it is well reviewed by critics - we saw what happened to the LA Times (banned to showings) when someone dares to cross Disney.  Help me George\\, you are our only hope!","true":true}
