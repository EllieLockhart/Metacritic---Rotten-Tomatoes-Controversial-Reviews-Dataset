Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a disgrace to the Star Wars saga. Poor plot twists that make no logical sense and are totally disappointing. It seems like Disney wanted to surprise audience by going for the most lamest and crap ideas. Biggest problem is Luke's character. Disney wants to sell off Rey as this invincible girlpower so they have to kick down and humiliate the original hero. Make him suck milk out of a cow's breast\\, chuck a legendary weapon over his shoulder\\, be a total wimp and kill his own nephew and then was too afraid to face the First order so sat on a rock to do some force trick only to die because he was too tired and to go out in the most pathetic death for such a legendary character in cinema history. This character was not Luke Skywalker because Rian Johnson knows dipshit nothing about Luke's character from the original trilogy. Luke is a fearless hero\\, he never once backed away like a coward like he was in this movie.","true":true}
