Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see what they are trying to do with this. The torch has to be passed. But as a fan of the original trilogy they really missed me on this. The use of Luke and Snoke is laughable. A huge miss and a wasted story. ","true":true}
