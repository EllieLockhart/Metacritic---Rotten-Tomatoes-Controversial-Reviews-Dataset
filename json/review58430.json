Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a great movie the problem is most of the people that want to see it are living in the past. They wanted to be like it was in the late 70s and early 80s but they have to realize those characters are old and now gone\\, these are new characters in the story line new director everything's different and I knew this was gonna be a problem with fans once they went in a different direction you were going to get a diehard original Star Wars fans pulling their hair out and complaining. Like they did with the force awakening that was too much like a new Hope so you can't satisfy diehard Star Wars fans they wanted to be just like the old but when you try and do that they complain so you do something new and they complain there's no satisfy now\\, that's why the majority of the critics like the movie because they want to different direction so it is what it is now it's down to 62 percent audience score it's probably going to fall in the 50s and it's not gonna make the money that they think it is domestically and I'll probably do well overseas like I said there's just no satisfying the old Star Wars fans they're going to nitpick everything","true":true}
