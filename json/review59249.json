Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Imagine playing the first The Last of Us years ago and falling in love with the story and the character. Then imagine finding out years later that there will be a sequel to a game that you already love. You go out to buy the new sequel\\, The Last of Us Part 2\\, getting home and start playing the game. Then imagine being faced with nothing but disappointment.  You find out that the developer has been lying about the content of the sequel and has been false advertising about the story  about Joel. Now imagine one of the main characters that you love \\, Joel gets killed in a way to show killing the patriarchy. Yes\\, they kill Joel with a golf club to symbolize him being killed by a male reproductive external organ. What's worse\\, in the game you are forced to do horrid unethical things but you don't get a choice. You have to do it in order to progress in the game then the game nags you about what a horrid person you are after wards. The cherry on the top\\, you have to play as Joel's killer. It was bad enough that he was killed\\, but then you have to play as his murderer.  The game has great graphics and the game mechanics I find sub par\\, but the story and lack character development has led me to have nothing but disdain for this game. I would only buy this game as a gift to people that I dislike. If you love the first The Last of Us\\, then don't buy\/play this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
