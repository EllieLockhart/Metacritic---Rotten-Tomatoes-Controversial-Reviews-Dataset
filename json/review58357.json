Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few underdeveloped characters aside (which is the norm for blockbuster films in general)\\, really enjoyed what Rian Johnson did with this entry. The pacing was my only issue in the first half\\, but I've seen every film he's made and new he was going to twist and turn the film in ways that subverted expectations\\, and he sure as hell did. Looking forward to JJ's finale of this trilogy\\, but really looking forward to what Rian does with his own blank slate. If anything felt hindered that he had to deal with the legacies built into this film.","true":true}
