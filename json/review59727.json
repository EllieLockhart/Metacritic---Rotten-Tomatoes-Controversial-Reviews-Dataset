Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is main focus is the story so I will focus on that too.I can\u2019t say that the graphics and gameplay aren\u2019t  good because they are.But I just feel it\u2019s such a waste to have this amount of attention to detail in the game and For it to be just thrown down the drain.This game could\u2019ve been something special but due to unlikable characters and a lackluster story It fails miserably to deliver.I just hope that this once upon a time great studio Can go back to focus on making great games and not hammering home appoint that we all agree upon.You can feel that there\u2019s something wrong going on at naughty dog studios\\, people quitting\\, almost everyone who worked on the first game are gone.Something in the game happens something horrible and they force you to play the character that did that thing. Which is one of the biggest complaints that see people talk about and They are right because that character isn\u2019t likable and isn\u2019t relatable she\u2019s purely evil she\u2019s not well motivated and she\u2019s definitely not charismatic.I would\u2019ve loved to play the villain like Negan for example from The Walking Dead someone who is charismatic someone who you enjoy watching them be bad or even good sometimes but no you gotta push an agenda.you get what you deserve naughty dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
