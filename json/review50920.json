Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute disaster of a movie. I'm disgusted by what I saw last night. This story is complete garbage. No story on Snoke\\, Rey is trained in 5 minutes. Luke does nothing. No lightsaber duels. It's beyond me how anyone thought this was Star Wars.","true":true}
