Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MINOR SPOILERS\\nI honestly do not see why people are giving this movie bad reviews. This is definitely one of the best in the series. It's humorous\\, visually pleasing\\, surprising but good twists\\, and great performances\\, especially Mark Hamill. While I do agree that Luke would have never have acted the way he did\\, how would you feel if you were the cause of the destruction of the new Jedi order? I can sympathize with him there\\, but I doubt he would have ever actually felt like killing Ben Solo. Looking past this though\\, It was a great movie! Definitely one of my favorites and I definitely recommend seeing it!!","true":true}
