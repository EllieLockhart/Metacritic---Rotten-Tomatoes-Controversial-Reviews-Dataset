Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this movie on Friday with a couple of my friends. I really enjoyed it. Sure\\, it wasn't perfect and there were moments where I questioned what they were doing. But I felt so excited about the next Star Wars film coming out of the cinemas. \\nSo I was quite confused when I began looking into spoiler reviews for this movie where there was a significant portion of the population that hated this film. I wasn't alive to see the original star wars films and I admit I am not a big fan of the franchise. However that maybe the reason why some of the things that bothered hard core fans didn't bother me. I think people should still watch it because you will be surprised at what this film has to offer.","true":true}
