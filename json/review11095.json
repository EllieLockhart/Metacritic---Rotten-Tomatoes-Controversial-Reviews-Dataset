Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"High expectations after The Force Awakens and the fantastic Rogue One. But what a let down this one is. Clumsy screenplay\\, poor directing\\, little or no real character development and ridiculous Harry Potterish additions to the 'force'.\\nLeia flying in space? Seriously. \\nAnd then there's those space 'bombers' What the heck. \\nSo much potential wasted.\\nWhy on earth would you change director's again.","true":true}
