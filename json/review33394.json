Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Takes immense risks. Delivers. Destroys expectations of character tropes. Delivers. I even enjoyed the oddball moments on Canto Bight. A film which definitely does not destroy Star Wars but breathes new life into an expected pattern of events. I understand the hatred but it is a result of nostalgia and prejudice blinding us. This is modern Star Wars. Live with it.","true":true}
