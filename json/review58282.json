Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely disgusting. Insulting and disrespectful to Hardcore fans\\, while at the same time boring\\, painfully unfunny and politically preachy to would be new fans. Just a colossal over correction by Disney\\, an attempt to go in another direction from the overly safe The Force Awakens\\, this film tries to set a new tone and ends up in a place that it just shouldn't be. Lazy writing\\, zero\\,character development\\, a strange lack of any interesting aliens or technology\\, (no new ships or weapons or ANYTHING?)  this movie just cashes in on the Star Wars brand and provides exactly nothing in return. Hugely unsatisfying and very annoying with its constant attempts to make light hearted (read juvenile) jokes which fall flat every. single. time. This movie will\\, indubitably\\, go down as the worst movie in franchise history. Will Disney be able to right the ship? Don't know. But this fan no longer cares.","true":true}
