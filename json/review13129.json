Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know which I enjoyed more\\, this fantastic Star Wars film or all the broflake ranting and wailing on here! I thought this film very satisfyingly dealt with questions arising from the first film and the larger legacy. Kylo's speech about clearing away the past and his killing Snokes were natural extensions of what he began in the last film by killing Han. I loved the e ho back to Vader's \\\"join me\\\" speech\\, but with the simple addition of \\\"please\\\" the whole tone was subverted but remained true to his character.I'm also liking the Rey has no link to this grand bloodline thing. Force sensitives can't all be Skywalkers\\, the force moves through ALL living things. Just brilliant. \\n\\nLiea using the force? Fantastic. Get over it.\\n\\nLet's deal with some of that broflake hand wringing: so you think this film was \\\"leftwing propaganda\\\"? Let me lay this out for you\\, Star Wars has always been about the rise\\, reign and overthrow of a right wing\\, fascist dictatorship. If you don't understand this then you are delusional. The Rebellion are LITERALLY an army of SJWs. \\nThe subplot about rich scum getting rich off of arms dealing\\, this would totally be a thing. \\nToo much humour\\, seriously!? Have you even watched the original trilogy\\, do you remember Han talking over the intercom on the Death Star? Liea's reaction to being \\\" rescued\\\" (also hold onto that thought for the whole misogyny debate)\\, C3-PO? EWOKS!? Star Wars is always at it's best when it is leavened with humour.\\n\\nStrong female lead characters are a good thing\\, breath\\, relax and grow up.\\n\\nI do have some criticisms of the film\\, bit too long\\, the \\\"sneak off and get help\\\" subplot was a tad shoehorned in (but I loved how it expanded the world)\\, but that's about it. There were some truly breathtaking moments\\, like the lightspeed suicide run\\, and some truly moving scenes\\, Luke's ascension in front of the twin suns (with John Williams theme)\\, Luke and Liea reunited\\, Rey admitting what she already knew about her parents. Great stuff.\\n\\nIn all it had the right balance of all the things I want from Star Wars (lightsaber fights\\, space battles\\, crazy bad guy tech\/weapons\\, the Force\\, humour) and some new\\, fresh takes on the saga (out with the old ways that have failed\\, who else besides Skywalker's have a connection to the Force). I truly felt I had my money's worth.","true":true}
