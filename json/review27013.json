Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies of all of them. Finally breaks out of the tired Skywalker destiny plot that has dragged down the series for too long. Glad Disney took a risk with Rian Johnson to give us a genuinely interesting and character driven movie\\, rather than JJ Abrams reboot which was essentially a series of tropes and rip offs (albeit fun and enjoyable).\\n\\nIgnore the rightwing bots\\, this movie is worth seeing.","true":true}
