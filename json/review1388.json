Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Co-Host of a Star Wars Podcast (The Coruscant Pulse Podcast! Check us out! ;) ) I have very strong feelings about Star Wars. It isn't always good (like discussing The Force Awakens) but overall it is usually pretty positive.\\n\\nI wasn't expecting the movie we got in TLJ. I didn't like all of the decisions they made. But this movie was amazing even still. Easily the best Star Wars film we have ever seen. Did it mess with what I expected to happen? Yup. Did it ruin some of my deeply held fan theories? Of course it did. Does that make it a worse movie? Not in the slightest.","true":true}
