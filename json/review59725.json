The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"worst game ever\\, congrats NaughtyDog for ruining a classic\\, and trying to pin your failure on homophobia and transphobia\\, I'm gay\\, and I hated this game\\, I hated the secret social justice warrior bs\\, the agendas\\, and ideologies you tried to push through the game. Do you really think a trans person would care about pronouns in a world like this? really? or an extremist group would care about some trans person in an apocalyptic world.  Do you think you can disrespect a great smart character like Joel and get away with it? did you really think making us play Abby was a good choice? that we'd sympathize with her? You killed Joel in the most humiliating way possible\\, a great character died in the stupidest way possible. Joel\\, the guy that never trusted strangers\\, and barely trusted anyone\\, the guy that survived 25 years in that world. is killed by strangers with a golf bat\\, do you think The Joel Miller would be so casual with armed strangers in the apocalypse? the man that didn't stop for an injured man who turned out to be an enemy is so casual with a group of armed strangers in a small clear space without cover\\, hell he didn't even seem cautious between them\\, he told them his name so casually. This game is the biggest disappointment of the century. you kept the narcissistic creep Niel but didn't pursue the actual important people that made The Last Of Us so great\\, no you let this creep Niel drive them out\\, just to spam the game with his face\\, props about him\\, (self-inserts) and characters that look like him. That creep wanted nothing but to make this game about himself. the characters not only are out of character\\, but they aren't even logical\\, it's like the game was written by an alien pretending to be a human. What person sees someone they view as a father being bashed to death and then have their fingers bitten off by that same person that killed your father figure\\, and then you let them live. so basically she went to get her fingers bitten off and then went back home\\, really? so she kills Nora but lets Abby go? critics huh? great job deceiving us NaughtyDog\\, making us believe Joel will help Ellie with her revenge in the trailer and making us believe he's going to have a big role in the game\\, and then you change everything\\, this is the last game I buy from Naughty Dog\\, and I'm getting a refund soon. what a let down that was. redo the game\\, or pull it from the shelves and don't make a sequel in the first place. fire Neil Druckmann. he's the reason this amazing game is now ruined\\, he is the guy that shoved his face in the game\\, just to have sex and spit on Joel's corpse. kinda symbolic. bring back the original crew. Neil didn't make this game for the fans or the story\\, he made it for himself. you can CLEARLY see that from the writing and storytelling\\, Neil shouldn't even create a game\\, let alone the sequel to a beloved and anticipated classic game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
