Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why the audience seemed to like the cliche Force Awakens better\\, anyhow I found this movie to be much better than Force Awakens. It wasn't completely a spin-off of the originals\\, and I felt there was more unique concepts in this movie than Force Awakens. Not the best movie\\, but definitely a step up from Force Awakens.","true":true}
