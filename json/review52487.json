Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ahh\\, what a disapointment. The movie is beautiful as far as photography and CGI goes. But the plot and the characters absolutely ruined it. Entire lenghty segments could be removed without affecting the story\\, classic characters loved by the fans had their personality and actions go against everything we seen on previous movies\\, several misteries and elements that made fans excited turned into flops. There is no excuse here\\, this movie has bad story telling and pays no respect to the previous movies and materials of the star wars universe\\, pretty much all hype that was built up after the Force Awakens died in this movie\\, if not for this franchise's history I would probably don't even care about episode IX\\, as the Last Jedi destroyed the positive trend the franchise was on.","true":true}
