Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a true disappointment. After Disney bought the franchise\\, I was unsiure how he films would turn out. To the good of my luck\\, 3 of the 4 newer films have been great. This is the exception. The story line was boring from the get-go\\, and the plot didn't add up. Characters that had been built up in the previous movie were thrown aside\\, and the whole movie seemed like a waste of time. I don't know how the main series can recover from a dismal display like this. Solo\\, Rouge One\\, and The Force Awakens were great fun\\, but this one definitely missed the mark.","true":true}
