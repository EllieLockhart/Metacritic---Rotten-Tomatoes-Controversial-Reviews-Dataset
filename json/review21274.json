Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie\\, like many others\\, on the heels of the entire Star Wars saga. Over the last few weeks I've been slowly chipping away at everything Star Wars just to freshen my take on the whole story that I've seen countless times. I slowly stoked my fires of excitement with every episode that ticked off my list until I finally found myself before \\\"The Last Jedi's\\\" opening crawl. It wasn't long into the film\\, maybe like fifteen minutes\\, before I had my first \\\"ugh\\\" moment. It wouldn't be the last. \\n\\nDirector Ryan Johnson certainly has had his fair share of successes. And his latest entry into the Star Wars universe will certainly be among them as the critic score of this film will show. But look to the right\\, and you'll see what people really think of it. Bland. Comedy forced needlessly into otherwise dramatic scenes with characters that have had plenty of hype only to be cast aside like cannon fodder. Episode 8 has by far been the worst Star Wars film since Disney has taken over. I would almost rank it below the prequels\\, were it not for those nostalgia cards that were played just right in a few scenes. \\n\\nWhile my love for Star Wars as a whole will lead me to buying this movie the day it comes out\\, I do not do so out of joy\\, rather\\, for the sake of a complete collection. Nothing more.","true":true}
