Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok now Really \\,Disney is the next EA ... Not Good in making games but good at giving I-Candy ..  We want both  Epic Story's  Done . RIGHT ...  You broke Lucas Sky-walker and you spit on the new Characters like -Ray  well 0 Background  where we all know she should of been a sky walker but you  spit on so much of the story and now what we get less \\, Gorge Lucas makes better star wars  Then Disney . its a shame . so many problems with  The Last Jedi.  And messing up Lucas Sky walkers Character   is so bad of you Disney   .  I hope they fix the next movie \\, to correct what they have done wrong with this one","true":true}
