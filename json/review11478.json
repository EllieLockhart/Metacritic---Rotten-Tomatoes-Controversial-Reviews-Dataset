Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible Movie\\, never have watched a Star Wars movie and felt so disappointing before it had no plot and was filled with pointless scenes such as the Casino Planet called Canto Bight was basically force socialism ideology. Even though the Prequels was below average\\, it had a plot and saw the Fall of Anakin Skywalker and the Jedi Order but The Last Jedi for me was worse. It had so many wasted characters like Snoke and Phasma. They made Snoke to be the biggest disappointment in cinematic history and made Phasma into a joke once again. To add on to that they made General Hux into a complete joke\\, to be honest Hux got bullied in the film by the Resistance\\, Kylo Ren and Snoke. The heroes where okay Poe Dameron did great to be fair and Finn was okay. Rose is the most pointless character ever she had no purpose in the film\\, her sister who had one scene was way more interesting than her. Star Wars fans will come to appreciate George Lucas for what he gave us and wish he was back.","true":true}
