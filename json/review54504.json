Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was utterly dissapointed in this film.. it is easily the worst if not second the worst movie in the franchise following behind Attack of the clones. I felt like they tried to add way too much Disney where it didn't belong but what else do you expect? other than that the movie didn't have any sick light saber battles which is what I was going to fall back on for action so there for action is very sub par. there are a few times in the movie where you feel like someone should die and they are going to but they don't and just flat out flop. I could go on for a while but if you really want to watch the movie after reading all of this then you will other wise it's lucky to get a star and a half but it only gets the half because it's star wars and some of the explosions looked cool..","true":true}
