Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke spent years learning the force and could barely move a rock before leaving dagobah\\, anakin at 9 years old was \u201ctoo old\u201d to become a Jedi. Yet\\, Rey is moving boulders. She learns nothing from Luke and he\u2019s out of his mind. So many continuity errors. I am not against new Star Wars movies. I absolutely loved Rogue One. It is right next to the OT for me. But episode 7 and 8 are so unoriginal and absolutely destroy the myth and mystery behind the force. ","true":true}
