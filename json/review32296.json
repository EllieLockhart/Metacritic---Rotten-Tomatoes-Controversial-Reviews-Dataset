Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Geeks can be the mots haterific of all but the critics got this one right. Its a wonderful movie. The only primary Star Wars film that feels like an actual war is happening. Definitely intense and exciting.","true":true}
