Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was far better than the force awakens and did a good job of balancing quality and diversity with all the powerful female characters. The pacing is good\\, the effects are good\\, the characters become more dense and relatable than in the first and in the general the movie gives the series a nice direction and poise\\, now rather excited for the third where as force awakens left me with low excitement and exceptions for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
