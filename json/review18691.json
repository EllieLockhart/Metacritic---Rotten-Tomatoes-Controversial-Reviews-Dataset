Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I truly did enjoy this movie. There were some issues with the pacing but overall I felt that this movie was extremely well done. Visually I would say its the best looking star wars movie yet. It took some directions that were unexpected and for me it paid off. It was really powerful and I loved what they did with Luke. As a star wars fan it was completely satisfying.","true":true}
