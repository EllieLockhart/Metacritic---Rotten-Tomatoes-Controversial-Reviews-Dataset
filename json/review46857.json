Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well this movie made a rather soft and a little overnostalgic attempt at a soft reboot into a mess. 1 Star only because I\u00b4m really interested in how will try to fix it in the sequel. This film as it is doesn\u00b4t fit star wars\\, and would\\, if it wasn\u00b4t in the franchise\\, just be a weird\\, kind of boring\\, sci fi flic that really got some major tonal issues and seems based on a humor i just don\u00b4t get. Aside from Leia flying through space and the speech of Rose to Fin about saving the ones you love while the gate is melting away\\, those scene were hillarious.","true":true}
