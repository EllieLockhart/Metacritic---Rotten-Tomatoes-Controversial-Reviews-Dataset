{"101487":121369,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, right out in front: Rey\\, Ren\\, and their plot line was fantastic. The acting is excellent\\, the story is gripping. Also\\, I have no issue with the choices made for Luke. Bold\\, different\\, interesting.\\n\tTwo caveats to this: the reveal of Rey's origins is (as will be discussed below) incoherent with the previous film. Not a BAD choice absolutely\\, just incoherent read as a whole. And her outfit is dumb. I'm sorry folks-can we please get Daisy Ridley into something cooler than ugg boots and capris?  But onto the substance....\\n\\n---\\nOk\\, the very real issues (not fantasies of fanboys; VERY SERIOUS ISSUES):\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, the majority of the plot of the last Jedi is basically incoherent. The centering action of a slow-moving chase makes little sense for obvious reasons\\, and becomes quickly difficult to square with the power and speed of ships seen within the prior franchise films....and within the film's own first 15 minutes....and within the pointless side plot which hops off the mainline\\, and then back during the penultimate act. If such feats are possible for pointless\\, jokey\\, casino diversions\\, how can they be impossible to employ during the actual chase by the quite serious participants?\\n\\nThe destruction of the First Order fleet is incoherent with the previous films' use of technology-and with this film's\\, as it makes little sense why other ships would not have been used for this purpose in the first half of the movie.  \\n\tAlso.......autopilot? no? Ok....I guess. But what about DROIDS? Is the life of a beloved (never-before-mentioned)\\, valuable (unclear why) general worth less than every service droid left on the escape ships?\\n\tThe scene is beautiful\\, spectacular even. And it's fun. But\\, like much of the movie\\, it is roundly incoherent. (Dern's character is awful as well. Dern is a fine actress\\, but pretty much every aspect of her character\\, from the dialogue to the plot line\\, is just awful for a host of reasons. Enough said on that.)\\n\\nSnoke's death was incoherent with the time and plot energy committed in the Force Awakens\\, and with the power displayed in the first half of his appearance in this film. Let me clarify-it is not implausible that Snoke could be tricked and killed. Rather\\, it is incoherent as a film in plotting and pacing to focus on Snoke in such a way twice\\, to demonstrate power outclassing all the other main characters\\, and then to vanish him with little to no payoff or engagement. Its just poor plotting\\, and\\, like most of the movie\\, it clashes with JJ's first installment horribly. Like Green and purple argyle. \\n\\n----\\nThere are more plot and incoherence issues to discuss. I could go on and on. But I will leave it here\\, by saying: I didn't love JJ's installment. But ignoring it does not help. Reinventing it's threads\\, reshaping their direction-making them play new and unexpected roles. That would be great writing\/directing. Ignoring them-or cutting them curtly and overtly with no real engagement-just consigns the picture to second class status.\\n\\nNot a bad film. Really not. Just an interesting but flawed film\\, with terrible plotting. In the star wars context though: A poor installment\\, in light of its role in this specific trilogy\\, this specific universe\\, and as a specific followup to a different movie. \\n\\n[Please change Rey's stupid\\, stupid outfit. Am I the only one seeing this? I am? Maybe its just me....]","true":true}
