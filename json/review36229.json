{"101487":175906,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-07-07","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was willing to take risks. That alone makes it better than The Force Awakens\\, but it still has issues. The main criticisms I have with Star Wars as a whole\\, in this new Disney era is the modern dialogue and comedy. It's too on the nose\\, too Marvel. Apart from the middle act being bogged down by Finn and Rose's excellent adventure\\, I was at least interested in one thing (which is more I can say of the previous film)\\, and that is the development between Kylo and Rey. While I feel the direction it COULD have gone would have been much better\\, it was still enjoyable to see develop. Also\\,I felt Mark Hamill did a great job in his role. Everyone expected to see Luke as a legendary master of the force\\, but this twist was quite nice and welcoming. The broken mentor is a classic staple\\, but it's done well here. Overall\\, it's not as bad as everyone says. The humor kills it\\, and the pacing sucks in most places\\, but it has SOME things worth checking out.","true":true}
