Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ABSOLUTELY HATED IT. I was born in 1977\\, I grew up in the star wars fanclub\\, I love STAR WARS. LOVE IT. They had Luke\\, our childhood hero\\, STROKE OUT\\, fine he became 1 with the force\\, but stroked out come on. Now if Ben Solo dies\\, the skywalker line is gone\\, come on. Disney have failed us horribly\\, horribly. I am very upset at them. I mean\\, just have all the originals die in the crawl\\, instead of ruining their stories. Reys parents aren't leia\\, they aren't luke\\, she isn't a skywalker\\, how stupid\\, being so scared of repeating yourself that you hurt the story is just if not worse.","true":true}
