Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite Starwars movie so far :) loved the actors\\, the plot and twists\\, the jokes and sillyness\\, the fx\\, the soundtrack... really the whole lot.\\nI do understand a lot of people did not like it and\/or scrutanized every detail as it had to be explained\\, and that's fair... because it's a matter of taste (and expectations...).\\nGiven Starwars' legacy\\, I'd say everyone \\\"who cares\\\" should watch it and keep an open mind and low expectations :)\\nCheers!","true":true}
