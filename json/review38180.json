Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The trailer made me excited and made it look epic..it was all a lie. From the very beginning of the film it plays out like an SNL skit of itself..any hints of that Star Wars \\\"feeling\\\" and connection are instantly ruined with cheap unwelcome attempts at humor.  What he did to Luke's character was infuriating and insulting. No wonder Mark Hamill said he hates it..all the scenes without Luke\\, Rey and Kylo were so boring and pointless I just didnt even care. so disappointing..","true":true}
