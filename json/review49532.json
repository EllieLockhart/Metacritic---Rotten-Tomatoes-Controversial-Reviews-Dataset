Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\,   I don\u0092t get all these negative reviews....   this was a really good movie and I don\u0092t want to get into a review with spoilers so I\u0092m not going to go into details defending this movie but I have seen it twice and while I don\u0092t think this is a perfect movie\\, it is a SOLID next chapter in the Star Wars saga....  is it what I would have written\\,  well no....  but I can tell that the people who made the movie understand Star Wars and I think that they did a good job and am I excited for what\u0092s to come!  May the Force Be With You!","true":true}
