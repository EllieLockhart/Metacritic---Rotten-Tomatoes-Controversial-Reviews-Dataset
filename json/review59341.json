I wished I had burned my money rather than pre-ordering this piece of **** Could not even play it on release Day because I had to finish my bachelor but was so hyped I ordered it months ago. Sold my special edition for 20 bucks today to a poor unaware soul. I just gonna ignore this game in favor of the first game. This one feels like a badly written fanfiction with a huge budget. Never again Naughty Dog. Jak and Daxter was my first game and from that point I got every game Naughty Dog threw on the marked from day one. I was a huge fan of that company. But they ruined this trust I had in them not only with this game but also the way they react to the critics. The grafic and sound is great but the last of us is a story driven game and everyone could have written a better sequel in 10 minutes than that what naughty dog gave us. This game is a disappointed and a punch to the face for the fans and the story of the first part. I am done with this arrogant company called naughty dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
