{"101487":182790,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS IS SPOILER HEAVY! DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE RUINED!\\n\\n\\nI'm of two minds on this movie\\, so I will go into that after I give my overall opinion.\\n\\nSo\\, I loved this movie. I had such a fun time watching it. It took the lore in a different direct from what many people were expecting and I loved it for that. It surprised me in a good way.\\n\\nWith that aside\\, I understand completely why many fans are angry with this film. It has numerous logical flaws and many things were left unexplained. I myself don't mind not having everything explained and I often can make several assumptions about the film that fill in the blanks. However\\, not everyone is like that and they need far more explanation.\\n\\nIf you don't like loose threads in your films\\, TLJ will likely aggravate you.\\n\\nMany fans think that Disney has sh*t the bed with this one. But I believe (and this is a reason I enjoy the film more than others) that Disney KNOWS full well what they're doing and that much of what was not explained in episodes 7 and 8 will be revealed in episode 9. That means that the franchise hinges on episode 9 being well written. For some fans\\, that's not a good way to do movies in a franchise.\\n\\nSo\\, if episode 9 turns out to be amazing and it explains everything well\\, people might look back and realize this movie was great after all. If episode 9 is a disappointing mess\\, then episode 8 will look like an even bigger mess than people currently think.\\n\\nMy thoughts on certain perceived issues:\\n\\n1. Like most\\, I think the Finn and Rose subplot was a little long\\, but I didn't mind because it has some great action. I don't mind that Rose likes Finn since he's famous and what young woman doesn't want a handsome\\, famous partner if she can get one? Not a dealbreaker to have a romance there.\\n\\nThe animal cruelty subplot amkes sense thematically when you realize that a lot of this is about restoring balance to the force and stopping injustice. Some fans felt it was too politically charged. I didn't feel that. It fit in for me.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe is that they missed a great opportunity to introduce Lando Calrissian back into the SW saga in the Canto Bight scenes. I was very disappointed in that\\, but I can get over it.\\n\\nDJ's subplot has certain logical issues\\, but little is explained about him\\, so I think he'll be back in episode 9. But if he's not\\, thematically he represents how the universe doesn't really care about good and evil and he's just doing what he needs to do\\, whether moral or immoral.\\n\\n2. The whole Leia force pulling herself thing is both amazing and bad. It's amazing because it opens up that the Force is available to anyone and that in all likelihood\\, the Force has a will of its own and wants certain events to happen. This brings up exciting possibilities. It's bad in that\\, with Carrie Fischer's passing\\, Leia's near death experience would have been a surprising but understandable way to write her character out of the movies. With her still alive\\, the options for Leia are now severely limited. People were expecting a death scene\\, and it was taken from us in a strange and unexpected way.\\n\\n3. Some fans are mad that Luke has changed so much\\, but I don't mind when I consider that it's been thirty years and there's much we don't know about his relationship with Ben Solo. Luke is human\\, he makes mistakes. He was almost driven to do the wrong thing for the right reasons\\, but stopped himself. I can fully accept this character development.\\n\\n4. Some fans believe that Luke died at the end because he was so drained. I\\, however\\, fully believe that he purposefully relinquished himself to the Cosmic Force because he knew that he had done all he needed to do. I think he'll be back in episode 9 as a Force ghost.\\n\\n5. I agree that Snoke was completely useless as a villain. I think he'll be back\\, but if he isn't\\, we have to remember that\\, thematically\\, he was probably there to demonstrate how powerful Kylo Ren has become and that Kylo Ren was the true villain all along. The way they handled Snoke was bizarre though and I will be disappointed if we at least don't get some explanation for why he was so useless here.\\n\\n6. The whole space chase thing did seem silly\\, but we could just chaulk that up to the First Order being overconfident in their abilities.\\n\\nOverall: great movie. Not perfect\\, it has issues\\, but I think people are assuming the worst without considering that perhaps Disney actually has a decent plan in place.\\n\\nThat being said\\, if episode 9 helps explain nothing or gives us stupid reasoning for everything\\, I can fully expect that my opinion will change.\\n\\nTL;DR: Episode 8 is only as good as episode 9 is in two years time.","true":true}
