Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was great. Surprising and mindblowing positive moments. The subplot with Finn and Rose was okay\\, though it could be better. The film took elements from Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi\\, however thankfully was not a rehash.","true":true}
