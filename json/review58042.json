Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"why so much hate from the general public? I don't understand. I was born in 1979 and watched my first movie of the series in around 1983. I am a die hard fan. Yes there are a few elements that werent great\\, but this can be said of all of the movies in the series including ESB. This is a beautiful movie\\, stunning. It includes some of the greatest moments in any of the movies. Ignore the haters. This is an amazing film\\, better than TFA and almost equal to the ESB. Enjoy","true":true}
