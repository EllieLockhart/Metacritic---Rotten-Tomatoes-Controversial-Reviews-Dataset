Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\". That line from Luke Skywalker perfectly sums up The Last Jedi. It's also what makes the movie incredibly difficult to talk about without giving away any of the twists and turns.\\n\\nFor the first time since The Empire Strikes Back we have a Star Wars movie that isn't 100% predictable. This movie takes some big risks\\, it does things we haven't traditionally seen in a Star Wars movie\\, and I completely understand why that's pissed some people off. I feel like every hardcore Star Wars fan has a very specific checklist of things they want to see\\, and if all those boxes aren't checked\\, they're disappointed. Not me. I loved the fact this movie basically gave the middle finger to some of the things I was expecting to see. Some fans complained The Force Awakens was just recycled material\\, and now that The Last Jedi is trying new things...they don't like that either. I guess those people just wanted Luke Skywalker to grab his lightsaber and kill bad guys for two hours\\, but this movie isn't about fan-service (although there are some terrific callbacks to the original trilogy).\\n\\nA lot happens in The Last Jedi. Some of it is amazing\\, some of it is surprising\\, some of it is confusing\\, and some of it is frustrating. There were things built up in The Force Awakens that either aren't dealt with or are simply thrown away. Not everyone is going to love these choices because they aren't the safe choices\\, but it worked for me. We have heroes who make impulsive decisions and are left to deal with some fairly serious consequences. Not everyone is going to love a Star Wars movie with heroes who occasionally screw up\\, but I found it refreshing. Would those people prefer a series where no one ever grows\\, changes or makes mistakes? Boring.\\n\\nThere are certain story elements that have divided fans\\, and the film is definitely not without its flaws. It's essentially three storylines...I loved one\\, like the second\\, and was bored with the third. The film is too long\\, oddly paced\\, and certain characters are either underused or completely wasted. Still\\, the good far outweighs the bad\\, and I give writer\/director Rian Johnson a lot of credit for having the balls to make a Star Wars movie that isn't out to please everyone.\\n\\nI enjoyed the hell out of The Last Jedi (even with its flaws)\\, and it's exciting to know the next chapter in the saga could literally go in a million different directions.","true":true}
