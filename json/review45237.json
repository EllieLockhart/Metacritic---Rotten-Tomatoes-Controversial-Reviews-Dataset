Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unstructured story telling\\, no character development\\, slow paced bordering on boring\\, twists and surprises that aren't needed \/ don't make any sense \/ undermine the SW universe. This movie wasn't a \\\"risk taker\\\" it was lazy and incoherent.","true":true}
