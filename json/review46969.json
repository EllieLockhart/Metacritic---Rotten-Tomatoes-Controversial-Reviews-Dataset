Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a boring movie. Casino subplot was mindless drivel. Luke was not Luke. I'm not even a Star Wars fan\\, but what they did to Like was a travesty. Definitely won't being seeing the next one. Critics\\, what movie did you see?! Just another reason never to trust them.","true":true}
