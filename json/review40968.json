Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does not fit into the Star Wars universe. You leaving this film knowing nothing more about the characters and plot than when you went it. Some of the most important chacarters in this new trilogy and forgettable throw away characters that have been fabricated to just reboot a franchise and serve no other purpose. This saga was complete after VI. This new trilogy should have been set before Episode I or just stand alone films. I don't even care about Episode IX now.","true":true}
