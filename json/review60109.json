Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"What a brutal and dark game. I think it would be really difficult to make a revenge movie or game that was as ambitious as this was. They totally nailed it for me. I went from loving certain characters to hating them as well as hating some to loving them\\, in general I could just emphasis with how hard their lives had become. It was an emotional ride that often felt overwhelming but I\u2019m so so happy I played it. Firstly\\, killing Joel was obviously something they put a lot of time and thought into and it gave us a base to explore stuff that\u2019s definitely never been looked at in this way before. Revenge led everyone in a bad situation and we see how bad it is for everyone in the life\u2019s of those that go after it.The game looks so brilliant and real. The music and sound design makes you feel scared\\, sad and lonely in an insanely beautiful way. The places you go are unique and ridiculously detailed. The acting and the characters all do such an amazing job that now that I\u2019m done with the game I miss them. The gameplay is very similar to the first game but has been tweaked to feel more smooth and impactful than the previous game. I like that Abby\\, Ellie and Joel all play differently and have different skills. The ending is depressing and dark but it fits the tone of the game perfectly. We don\u2019t always get what we want and sometimes we miss opportunities when we are blinded by rage or something that\u2019s become an obsession. This dark story telling mixed with social issues like the LGBTQ+ issues and identity issues were done in a cool way that didn\u2019t feel like pandering.This game is super ambitious piece of art that has to be played to the very end to get the full scope of its gritty beauty and deep emotional message that are difficult to process for me even now. Thank you Naughty Dog for another awesome experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
