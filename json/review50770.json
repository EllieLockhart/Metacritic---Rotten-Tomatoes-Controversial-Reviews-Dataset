Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful movie to look at visually\\, but the film has a pessimistic\\, cynical\\, yet preachy vibe to it that doesn't feel anything like a Star Wars movie.  It's no surprise that sales of Star Wars merchandise (and the popularity of the franchise as a whole) went off a cliff because of this movie.  Last Jedi will be seen as the black sheep\\, the ne'er-do-well\\, the pariah\\, of the Star Wars franchise.  ","true":true}
