Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shocking film that had me on my toes from start to finish. Even as a major Star Wars enthusiast with several books and lore stuff under my belt\\, it felt exciting and refreshing. If the plot details are answered correctly by the next installment this will have been one of the best trilogy bridges I have seen.","true":true}
