Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok ... this was garbage. Forced diversity ruins a film every time after this I'm done with Star Wars. I'll save my money for actual good entertainment with diversity of thought and not skin color. I miss Georage Lucas","true":true}
