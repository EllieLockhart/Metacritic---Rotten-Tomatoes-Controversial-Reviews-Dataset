Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing movie! I would perhaps say that this is the best Star Wars movie this far.\\nThe original trilogy had the most basic story of good vs evil\\, and what sold them to us\\, was the great music and incredible design. It was memorable\\, and that makes the nostalgia stick even harder.\\n\\nOnly a few moments of bad CGI\\, but thats so rare these days that it passes with flying colors.\\nGreat twist with Snoke and i love how the movie not only blurs but scramble with the lines of good and evil.\\nEverything involving the casino and the horse-like animals was just stupid.\\nRey's parents and herself not being anyone special was refreshing and how Luke was a completely different character than what we remember\\, was also pretty nice.\\nMy favorite scene...There are so many! But the red room and the fight there was very creepy.\\n\\nThere are 4 things i couldn't stand in this movie...\\n\\n1: Everything involving the casino and the horse-things. It was a waste of time and felt out of place.\\n\\n2: The \\\"hacker\\\" they got in contact with when escaping the casino prison.\\nI love how the character was a person without any long story. They paid him off\\, and thats it. And thats refreshing.\\nBut the character himself annoyed me. The actor is amazing\\, but the character is too quirky while also being too good at what he's doing. Its like some goofball being amazing at everything with no explaination. makes no sense.\\n\\n3: Princess Leia floating in space. First off: Space works dfferently in Star Wars\\, so skip the logic. If you find space things weird\\, but you can buy into \\\"the force\\\" and \\\"light sabers\\\"\\, then you see the problem yourself.\\nI just think this would have been a fitting end for Leia. No huge buildup\\, but a brutal and harsh death\\, with a final peaceful glimpse. \\nI understand that she died in real life at a point where they still needed her in the story tho.\\n\\n4: Lukes \\\"death\\\" or giving himself to the force.\\nThis was a huge downer as we finally got to see the strong Luke we wanted to see\\, and then he's just gone...\\nI had no problems with his holo thing. I loved that\\, but i wanted more from him.\\nIt ended on a weird note-","true":true}
