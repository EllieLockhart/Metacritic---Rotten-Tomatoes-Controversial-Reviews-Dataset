Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The last jedi\\, is not a bad movie\\, but it is insulting.  \\nThe visual effects first off are AMAZING!  However\\, a movie can't function on beautiful effects alone. Once you get rid of these effects and are left with the story\\, you might be disappointed.  If you're a casual viewer\\, and barely know or care about the star wars lore\\, THIS IS FOR YOU! \\nHowever\\, if you are an actual fan of the franchise and it's lore\\, you can not watch this movie\\, and not be disappointed. \\n\\nBefore I watched the movie\\, I saw a lot of far left extremist media talk about \\\"Alt right\\\" bombing the film on here. I had a lot of good hopes for the movie\\, but in the end\\,  I know it's not \\\"Alt right\\\" bombing the movie\\, it's far left people who have no idea of what star wars is\\, praising it.\\n\\nThe big cliffhanger from the previous movie goes right off the cliff \\\"litteraly\\\" \\,  and the big question of \\\"who reys parents are\\\" will feel you dissatisfied and insulted. What they did to Lea was insulting to the bone. \\n\\nHowever\\, there were great moments which I won't discuss here because I don't want to spoil it\\, but they felt not enough. \\nIn conclusion\\,  this is in my opinion the most insulting star wars movie\\, but if you think about it as \\\"not really canon\\\" you still can have a lot of fun with it.","true":true}
