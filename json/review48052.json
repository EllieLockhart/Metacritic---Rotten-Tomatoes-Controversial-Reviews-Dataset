Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While some loyal star wars fans have voiced their displeasure for The Last Jedi\\, I thoroughly enjoyed this film! I did feel that Finn and Rose's arc slowed the pacing\\, but only slightly. I still liked that it gave us some backstory for Rose\\, a new character that we knew nothing about. I think that the fight scenes were some of the best I've seen in a Star Wars film\\, and perhaps my favorite explosion since the original deathstar. Finally\\, I liked that the film kept me guessing what would happen with a few surprises!","true":true}
