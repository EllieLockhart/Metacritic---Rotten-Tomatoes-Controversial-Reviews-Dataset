{"101487":169825,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has always been mythical\\, fantastic\\, and epic. The original trilogy was enigmatic\\, a story of a young hero fighting against his insticts and giving himself over to the Force. The prequels harken to romantic tales of chivalric knights trying to fight for good\\, albiet poorly and to only marginal success. The Force Awakens brought back to life the idea of the force\\, the validity of the way these movies made us feel\\, told us that \\\"it's true\\, all of it\\\". And then\\, with a sloppy brush and broad strokes\\, The Last Jedi takes all of what The Force Awakens was building and\\, like Luke with his father's lightsaber\\, tosses it over its shoulder and goes \\\"nah\\, I'm not going back\\\". The Force Awakens was a step in the right direction\\, after many misguided stumblings with the prequels. The Last Jedi looks in the right direction\\, acknowledges it\\, then takes several strides the wrong way.","true":true}
