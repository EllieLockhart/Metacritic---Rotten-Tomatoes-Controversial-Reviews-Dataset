{"101487":105384,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone film\\, The Last Jedi may have passed for something decent. However\\, as a Star Wars film it fell flat on it's face. The major plot points set up by The Force Awakens were thrown out the window. We get pointless story arches that lead nowhere (I believe this is called horseshoeing). It also grossly destroyed Luke's character by changing the farm boy who saw good in everyone to someone that almost does something monstrous because of some doubt. Other things to note are the poor script lines\\, length\\, and lack of direction. The final sin was that there was no lightsaber duel in the entire movie (something that happens in every movie since A New Hope).","true":true}
