Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually its great but good about it I have to say lazy story telling and poor character development turned me off I have never seen such lazy story telling and I this is the type of star wars movies they're going to pump out then I want no part in it","true":true}
