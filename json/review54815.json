Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great. I think a lot of people are upset because the plot is rather unpredictable\\, and it didn\u2019t meet their expectations. Just relax\\, stop making predictions\\, and enjoy the show. Plenty of important events happen (and in my opinion in an interesting and logical order)\\, there aren\u2019t any plot holes as far as I could tell (both within the movie and within the franchise)\\, and the visuals\\, sound track\\, and acting are world-class. There is some humor but not a lot. It\u2019s the *last* freaking Jedi... yeah\\, it\u2019s going to be kinda dark. There are a few head-scratchers but nothing that can\u2019t be clarified in the next movie (I have faith after Rogue One shut everyone up about the Death Star flaw) It\u2019s a weird\\, sad\\, and very well produced space adventure flick. Don\u2019t freak out when it\u2019s weird and sad\\, and you\u2019ll enjoy it too.","true":true}
