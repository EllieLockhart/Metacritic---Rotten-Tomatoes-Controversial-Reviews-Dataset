Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally have always enjoyed the ideas in Rian Johnson's Films when it comes to Looper\\, Brick\\, and The Brothers Bloom. But this is one where I can't get behind everything.\\n\\nI felt that this film was too long and it was stretched too thin. On one hand\\, you have the Resistance trying to escape the First Order\\, but seemingly can't escape the tracking. And on the other hand\\, you have Rey being trained by Luke Skywalker. Let's talk about the first plot: Resistance escaping. This moment would be fine if it had been more tense and more focused than what it was. Instead\\, we get a useless Casino Planet Plot Line that eventually leads to nowhere causing the film's pacing to be slowed down. The Rose Character just doesn't work for this film either. She just gets in the way most of the time of completing any sort of goals.\\n\\nNow\\, with Rey and Luke Skywalker\\, it was underwhelming as well. Luke hardly trains her and yet when she leaves\\, she can still hold her own against people with more training. She only has one force lesson and apparently\\, that's enough to also learn how to handle a lightsaber.\\n\\nThe characters never really progressed in this movie. In fact\\, the characters are the same at the end as they were in the beginning. There's no reason left for Kylo Ren to be evil other than for the sake of being evil (that's a weak motivation). There are also specific moments in this film that were ripped straight from The Return Of The Jedi (Snoke trying to convert Rey) and The Enpire Strikes Back (the trench warfare on the Salt Planet at the end).\\n\\nIn the end\\, Rian Johnson had some great ideas in this film\\, but just couldn't execute. Rian Johnson is a great director when you watch his films\\, but he is weak as a writer. A failure of execution\\, pacing\\, and character development made me give this movie a One Star Rating. I would've rated it lower if I didn't like Rian Johnson's previous works. But\\, this is the Worst Star Wars Film in the Franchise so far.","true":true}
