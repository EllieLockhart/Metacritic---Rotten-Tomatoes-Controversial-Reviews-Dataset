Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some very nice imagery\\, but too much reused\\, trite dialogue and about 30 wasted minutes of an unnecessary and stupid subplot.  Also\\, if you want to depict casino scenes\\, just film it in Vegas\\, Monte Carlo\\, or Atlantic City.  I imagine AC is giving great deals for everything right now.","true":true}
