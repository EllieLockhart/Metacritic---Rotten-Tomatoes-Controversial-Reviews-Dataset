Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly heart-breaking.  While there were a number of good moments\\, the overwhelming feeling leaving the cinema was that this film was not merely a missed opportunity (Snoke\\, Akbar\\, Luke etc.) but a trashing of the franchise\\, killing off its best characters and setting up a real turd of a finale.  As good an actor as driver is\\, he lacks the menace necessary for this franchise; Rei goes in to the final movie as woefully underdeveloped as before; and\\, well\\, who is left?  This was not The Last Jedi but The Last Star Wars; I hope the director enjoys his 30 pieces of silver for this effort: he will certainly go down in film history.  The series is now\\, in my view\\, unsalvageable.  \\nAs for the positive critical reception\\, please Google (or better\\, use DuckDuckGo) 'Gamer Gate' - its a total con job; these people were either paid off or are sucking up to someone big time.  Totally dishonest.  You've heard about the fake news; open your eyes to the fake media.  Disgusted.","true":true}
