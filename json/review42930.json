Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was stunning and had some of the best emotional and action moments in Star Wars to date. It was truly a rollercoaster of emotions and had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through!","true":true}
