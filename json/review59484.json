There were things about the original that all worked together to make a certain experience. For me it was characters\\, story\\, setting and resource management.

Resource management and how it mixes with combat decisions is as cool as ever. The setting is awesome and you explore interesting places. The characters are well written but just not interesting and it doesn\u2019t help that neither is the story. It all revolves around a certain event\\, as if the event itself is going to shape the whole story like the tlou1 did with Joel and Ellie\u2019s relationship. It doesn\u2019t.

It would\u2019ve been nice to something maybe a little more lighthearted especially with everything going on in a world where there doesn\u2019t seem to be very much hope nowadays.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
