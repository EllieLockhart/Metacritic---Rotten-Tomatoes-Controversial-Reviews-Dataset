Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"56%? Seriously? There are either a large number of well paid trolls\\, or glue is the latest drug of choice. It was one of the stronger entries in the saga. Not perfect. But a strong entry. Better than Force Awakens\\, which was vastly superior to any of the prequels. I'd go so far to say it's at least as good as Return of the Jedi\\, and I'll tell you why without giving spoilers. The reveal on Rey's heritage was so much better than finding out Luke and Leia were siblings. The Porg vs Ewok concern. Porgs are better. They don't take up much screen time. The Ewok's were horrible\\, and they were 1\/3 of the movie. Phasma was under utilized but no worse than how Boba Fett was treated on Jabba's barge. The Leia reveal was trippy\\, that will be divisive. The Finn\/Rose story arc was probably the weakest part but was still pretty good. The Resistance fleet story arc was solid\\, even if the Leia reveal was weird. The Luke\/ Rey\/ Kylo arc was awesome. The lightsaber duel is one of the best. I thought the reveal of Rey's heritage brilliant\\, but I think it ticked off everyone with a theory because they were all wrong. This is one of the rare times I think the RT critics were right. Go see it.","true":true}
