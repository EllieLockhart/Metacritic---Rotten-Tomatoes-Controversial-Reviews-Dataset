Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1st 40 minutes were good\\, then it falls off a cliff. Too many issues to list\\, but when you actively root for some \\\"good guys\\\" to die & for the film to end (how many endings can 1 film have??) it's not good. Blame JJ & Kennedy for creating an uninspired \\\"saga\\\" - you set a bad course and can't abandon this junk now! How is this getting 93% on RT???","true":true}
