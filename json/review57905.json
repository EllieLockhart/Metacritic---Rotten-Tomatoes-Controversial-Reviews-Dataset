Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess of a movie. All of the important plot points set up in Episode VII are either not explained\\, or explained so poorly they may as well not have an explanation. Who is Snoke? Doesn't matter because he's dead now. Why is Rey so strong? No idea. She just is because\\, uhh...girl power. Who are the Knights of Ren? No clue. But perhaps the worst injustice is that the film completely kills Luke. Not just in a physical sense. They kill his entire legacy. When Mark Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with everything about his character in this film\\, he wasn't kidding. This is not the Luke we know from the original trilogy. Some may call this a brave move\\, but I find it a disservice to the original films\\, because it essentially negates everything he accomplished. People are applauding this movie for going in a new direction\\, but who cares if the direction it's going undermines the source material?  I hope that when everyone takes off their rose coloured glasses\\, they can see this film for the steaming pile of garbage it is. And I hope they pull the plug on Rian Johnson's new trilogy.","true":true}
