Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring. The critics are being bought out by Disney. I love\\, and have loved star wars for a long time\\, and it's not just that a movie like this one\\, is being praised at such a high level. None of the things that happened on this movie brings justice to the characters we have known and loved. it kills me to see this. Throughout the whole movie\\, I felt like I was wasting my time\\, even the prequels didn't make me feel that way. I hope Star Wars can be brought back\\, and even improved in the future.","true":true}
