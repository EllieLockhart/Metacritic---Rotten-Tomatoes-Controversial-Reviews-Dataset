Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Starwars movie in the history or cannon. I went and have low expectations but what I saw is a marvel studios in which I already saw in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2. They need to take this off starwars cannon.","true":true}
