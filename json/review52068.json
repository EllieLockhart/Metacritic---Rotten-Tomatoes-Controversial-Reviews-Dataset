Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, I really was hopeful that Disney's new direction would prioritize quality over mindless spectacle. This entry\\, however\\, was pure garbage. The Last Jedi is more akin to the Star Wars prequels (for reference\\, it also felt like the Matrix sequels).\\n\\nTo summarize The Last Jedi\\, simply rotate:\\n-grand visual spectacle\\n-weak and hollow plot points and characters\\n-moments of complete stupidity and silliness\\n\\nI do not understand the critical fawning for this movie - the critical reaction is entirely absurd. If you think Last Jedi was good:\\n\\n-you're as delusional as a cultist\\n\\n-you're a child (this is totally fine)\\n\\n-you have ulterior motives (either a Disney-paid critic or a SJW willing to sacrifice quality for political values)\\n\\n-you just want a big glorious visual spectacle\\, and don't distinguish Star Wars from Transformers","true":true}
