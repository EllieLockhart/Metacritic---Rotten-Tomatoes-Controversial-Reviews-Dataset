Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Soured by a lack of interest in creating a compelling story and more interested in subverting your expectations. This movie seems more like a prank played on any fans of the original trilogy or perhaps even its predecessor\\, The Force Awakens when it treats any of the continuing stories that might have brought you into the theater with contempt. The Last Jedi strips the Franchise of everything that made it great and will be remembered as the episode that brought down the biggest franchise in modern history.","true":true}
