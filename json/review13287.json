Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't want to flesh this review out as I will be required to feel. And i feel sad this script got green lit. I'll do my best to ignore this in the grand Skywalker saga and perhaps fill in the black hole with my own imaginings over time. However great a movie looks and sounds in the moment\\, it needs good context to ground it. TLJ holds no long lasting passion i associate with most star wars storytelling. Milking the cow might not be so easy if Disney keeps this up.","true":true}
