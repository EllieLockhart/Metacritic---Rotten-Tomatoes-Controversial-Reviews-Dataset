Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with Star Wars\\, starting with the remasters in the 90s. I was able to enjoy the prequels quite much. I could not enjoy this. Say what you will about Lucas's final three efforts\\, but this was a disappointment from the beginning. The redeeming qualities\\, ie. the Guard fight\\, female badassery\\, were so far out numbered by the incohesive narrative\\, tonally off-putting attempts at humor\\, and poor writing that I will find it very hard to watch again.","true":true}
