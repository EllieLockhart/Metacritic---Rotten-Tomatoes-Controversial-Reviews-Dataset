{"101487":144615,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was entertaining good effects but was not a believing story..important characters came and went making little impact...had other characters that wer useless...thought that the direction to the staory was rushed leaving a bad transition from part 7 goin into 9..Hope disney can take their focus off of the merchandise and finish this trilogy right..and stop watering down the stories..get the right dirctors in the chair and clean up this mess..can we have the Russo Bros?","true":true}
