Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible treatment of Luke\\, horrible non sense action\\, Rey is more powerful than everyone with the force without any previous training. Hands down the worst star wars movie. Lots of youtube videos describe the hundreds of faults better. I still can't believe they wasted Luke's potential contribution to these movies so completely. JJ obviously set him up for a prominent storyline in this movie but Rian decided to trick everyone and go a different way.","true":true}
