Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite simply the best film in the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back. Fast-paced\\, poignant\\, funny\\, and filled with gripping action sequences\\, The Last Jedi is neither a bad digression from Star Wars orthodoxy like Rogue One nor hindered by excessive references to the 1st trilogy\\, as The Force Awakens was. To hate this movie you'd have to be a dogmatic fan of the prequel trilogy\\, i.e. a moron\\, or a carping fan boy whose fed up with with its refusal to indulge the typical excesses of a Star Wars film (sorry\\, no slave bikini girls to be  found here).  In 20 years the Last Jedi will still be revered by critics and\\, at that point\\, fans alike as not only the best Star Wars film bar Empire\\, but the most accessible and least indebted to fan boy culture by far. Rather than a simple \\\"cross-over\\\" attempt\\, Last Jedi represents an elevation of the franchise back to the level of respectable cinema that is good not just as a Star Wars film but as a film\\, period. It never succumbs to tiring self-seriousness\\, and manages to incorporate a good deal of humor without losing the sincerity typical of the franchise. More than any of the other episodes since the eighties\\, one leaves this movie with the impression that you just invested two and a half hours of life in genuine art with compelling characters whose struggles you were actually invested in\\, rather than a childish cartoon\/mediocre action flick.","true":true}
