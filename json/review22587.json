Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die. Kill it\\, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.\\\" - Kylo Ren\\n\\nThe Last Jedi fixes the most crucial problems with The Force Awakens - predictable\\, unoriginal plot points and a nauseating level of fan-service and nostalgia\\, while also delivering plenty of suspense\\, humor\\, stunning visuals\\, and excellent performances from actors both old and new. The film's theme of letting the past die\\, epitomized by Kylo Ren\\, applies to the direction of the franchise itself\\, as TLJ does what TFA failed to do: adding something new and interesting to the Star Wars universe and showing that these sequel films can have value beyond coddling old fans' nostalgia and earning money for Disney. It's definitely not a perfect movie - Luke's training of Rey (or lack thereof) was disappointing and awkward\\, and the dialogue is still not as inspiring and memorable as that of the OT\\, but it's a sorely needed addition to the Star Wars universe and well worth going to see.","true":true}
