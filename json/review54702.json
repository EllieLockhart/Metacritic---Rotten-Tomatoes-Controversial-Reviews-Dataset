Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this movie. A good story was told with a lot of twists and turns and defies expections in surprising ways. The actions scenes are epic\\, the humor plays for the most part pretty well. But the standouts to me were the character developments of each character. They took these character to directions I didn't see coming and certain characters dying I DEFINITELY didn't see coming. My only real negative critique is the level of prior knowledge of previous Star Wars films you'll need to have to really appreciate this film. I recommend boning up on the original trilogy and The Force Awakens to get you all caught up for The Last Jedi. Otherwise\\, see this movie\\, have fun. A perfect movie to this holiday season. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f","true":true}
