Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars movie it's among the worst. As a film on it's own it's laughable how poorly constructed the film is. The more I thought about the actual plot the more I was amazed how awful it was. \\n Why didn't any of the star destroys just hyper-speed into the main Resistance ship? This is the film that introduced the concept of hyper-speed being used as a weapon so it baffles the mind who the writer could have missed that simple detail. And that's just one of it's many\\, many\\, many problems.\\nCherry on top it gives one of the most infamous examples of character assassinations in Luke Skywalker's portrayal and it only breaks my heart that Mark Hamill gave his all in this performance and only shows how committed the man really is. \\nTLJ  may not be the worst film I've ever seen\\, but it holds a strong contender for my nomination.","true":true}
