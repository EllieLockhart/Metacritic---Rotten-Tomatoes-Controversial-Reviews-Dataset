Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is really annoying for me to read all of the positive reviews saying how original this movie was. After the Force Awakens followed the blueprint of A New Hope so closely\\, we all bought in and I thought now we could actually get an original movie\\, but instead we get retreads of most of the major events in Empire and Jedi (along with a few from A New Hope\\, as well). \\n\\n1\/3 of the movie is just copy\/pasted from the iconic scenes of the Original Trilogy and Rian Johnson just adds goofy and\/or surprising twists so that he can \\\"subvert\\\" the \\\"tropes.\\\" His irreverence and subversion of the material not only diminished the impact of his own storyline\\, but I think it diminished the series as a whole.\\n\\nYes\\, there are some awesome moments and great visuals but they are\\, by far\\, outweighed by the ridiculous amount of silly\/goofy jokes (it's superhero movie level)\\, forgettable\/pointless subplots\\, and plot holes. \\n\\nThe plot and character arcs suffer badly just in the name of getting Johnson's major theme across. Ideals that I think are very interesting and would have really enjoyed them being artfully explored\\, but Johnson is clumsy and ham-fisted\\, beating you over the head with them with many examples and also just flat out stating them.\\n\\nThere was a moment in the movie where I thought it might take a turn and tread it's own path with two characters teaming up\\, but instead now that the movie is over we are somehow back to where we started around the end of A New Hope only with new characters but the same old\\, already used storyline.\\n\\nMaybe now that there seems to be nothing left to reference from the Original Trilogy we can finally get an original movie? Could be\\, but I think this might be the last time I will have gotten excited about a Star Wars movie\\, which is pretty sad.","true":true}
