Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I\u2019m a die hard Star Wars fan... Jar Jar Binks is leaping for joy that he is no longer in the worst Star Wars movie. No character development. Too much forced humor\u2014Disney please stop this it\u2019s getting out of hand\\, this isn\u2019t marvel. Trying way too hard to copy things from the original movies in a bad way. Really the only rebel base you could think of would be something that resembles Hoth? white sand instead of snow? Really? Jar jar binks would have made this movie better.","true":true}
