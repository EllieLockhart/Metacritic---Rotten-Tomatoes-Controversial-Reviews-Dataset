Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens wasn't much better than this garbled\\, soulless\\, uninspired shitfest. But at least it left me mildly curious as to what happens next. \\n\\nIt turns out that I was more invested than the fucktards that made this awful movie. That the questions TFA posed were just Abrams Mystery Boxes(TM). Another way of saying 'We'll make that shit up later\\, if we can be bothered.' What a fucking waste of time. \\n\\nTwo movies in and I have no fucking clue what the adversaries in this trilogy are fighting for. After this snoozathon I don't care. And that's what pisses me off. So many gifted artists and technicians had their talents wasted crafting this highly polished turd.\\n\\nImagination is limitless. And this is what we got. What. The. Fuck.","true":true}
