{"101487":121366,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, let's remember this is supposed to be a new entry in an ongoing saga.\\nNo reboots\\, remakes\\, alternative universe or re-imagining like some other movies like say \\, Star Trek for example.\\nSo when you hear people say\\, \\\"I like this movie because it reminds me of Empire\\\" or \\\"it's the best Star Wars since Empire\\\"\\, that's because it sort of IS partially Empire. It wants you  to feel  that and plays off it\\, just like the last one played off of New Hope.\\nOh\\, sure they make it a little different\\, how could they not.\\n\\nHere's the thing\\, the movie is recycling story lines from itself. It's all been done and done far better.\\nHow is this new \\,innovative or most of all fresh ? \\, actually the opposite. If this wasn't already a Star Wars movie \\, you  would say that this is ripping off Star Wars\\nRemember this is not like Star Trek where they are starting over\\, the old stuff still happened.\\nYou think Leia might realize that ''hey I've sorta already been through this\\\"\\, with the Death Stars\\, evil Jedi  family members\\, space chases and a Hoth type planet with bunkers and walkers attacking ?\\nPretend your watching this entire saga in order IV to VII for the first time\\, so we have some key points off the top of my head:\\n\\nIV Rebels vs Empire \\, Death Star\\, droid has information\\, old Jedi hiding out\\, old Jedi disappears after sacrifice fight\\n\\nV walker battle \\, space chase\\, remote planet with reluctant Jedi master\\, Jedi training \\, betraying rogue\\,  capturing rebels and using as bait \\, reveals \\, epic light saber battle\\n\\nVI Death Star rebuilt \\, throne room with evil leader\\,  rebels send group to knock out device \\, Luke builds new lightsaber and with team effort saves his friend in a very unrelated to Empire side story\\, Luke redeems his father's soul\\n\\nVII Death Star (Starkiller) again\\, rebels vs Empire again\\, old Jedi hiding out again\\, droid has information again\\n\\nVII space chase\\, remote planet with reluctant Jedi master\\, training? Rebels send group to knock out device\\, throne room with evil leader\\, reveals? or anti-reveals \\, betraying rogue \\, walker battle?\\,  jedi disappears after sacrificing himself\\n\\nWithin five movies we have numerous repeats of the same plot points. It's VERY noticeable the repeats taken this way -- very\\, very bad and unoriginal storytelling.\\n\\nThe prequels were actually NEW\\, fresh and innovative in comparison and it took risks.\\nUnfortunately most of the things didn't work out well\\, but it was all there\\, even if not properly portrayed.\\n\\nThis is a fantasy space-opera\\, in the end WE DO want the hero to save the day and overcome evil and that hero should have been Luke.\\nNot run away then commit astral suicide\\, which is what he did.\\n\\nLastly\\, the movie is called \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\, JEDI is in the title. Show me some JEDi action\\, no real lightsaber or force battles at all. Unless you count the throne room scene (I dont since they were regular guards even though they should have had some tricks being elite guards and all and illusions aren't real duels nor is fighting over a lightsaber).\\n\\nSome memorable action for Luke would have saved some fan opinion on this movie","true":true}
