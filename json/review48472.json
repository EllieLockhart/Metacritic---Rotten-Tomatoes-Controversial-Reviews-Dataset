Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With so much negativity being thrown at this movie\\, I thought I'd shared my positive thoughts. Was the Last Jedi perfect? No. Was I disappointed that things didn't go the way I thought? Somewhat\\,  yes.\\n\\nHowever\\, Rian Johnson did a masterful job with his vision. He wanted a solid movie that would surprise fans\\, and bring joy to the audience. From the mid-film villain twist to the homages to Empire Strikes Back\\, every minute has me listen closely to pull every bit of lore from this universe. I love the bits of depth we got into ship logistics as well\\, as this is the first time the series has even mentioned fuel and explained cloaking.\\n\\nUltimately\\, I feel like many were disappointed because of the breaks from tradition. I'm sorry that this wasn't a glorified Empire remake. I feel like it was solid\\, and lived up to or surpassed every one of my expectations. \\n\\nAlso\\, shut up about the Porgs. They are not the Minions\\, they're a perfectly fine piece of wildlife.","true":true}
