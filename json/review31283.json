Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some awesome moments\\, ruined by many many awful moments. Not sure why some peoples reaction is that it's awesome that they are ripping apart the character lore and established Star Wars tone. You can do something different without ripping the hear and soul out of it.\\n\\nIf I wanted to see spoofy quips I would go watch Guardians of the Galaxy. Way too many quips and gags that ruined the vibe\\, went against characters\\, and disrupted the story. \\n\\nAlmost everything involving Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Res was great. I don't even care enough to finish this review. Huge disappointment and the disparity between the critic ratings and the audience rating makes me convinced Disney pays for good reviews.","true":true}
