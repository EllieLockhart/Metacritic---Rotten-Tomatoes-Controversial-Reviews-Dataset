Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is hands down the WORST star wars movie ever made. You can't even call it a star wars movie it''s that bad. This film is absolute garbage. There is nothing interesting about the story\\, and the characters. Whoever made the decisions in this movie needs to be fired immediately because now I don't even want to watch star wars anymore. These people don't even know what star wars is or what it should be. Mark Hamil is not happy with it. George Lucas is not happy with it. He said it was beautifully made. But what he really meant was yes the movie \\\"looks beautiful because of the unlimited budget at Disney\\\". But he meant it is a beautifully made pile of trash.","true":true}
