Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ was far too derivative of episodes five\\, six and even four\\, despite trying so hard to trick the audience it isn't.  This movie was plagued with an incoherent storyline\\, poorly explained or utterly neglected crucial plot fillers\\, discontinuity from the original characters (even the last movie)\\, underdeveloped\/uninteresting characters (save Kylo Ren)\\, forced agenda\\, and the same expected forced humor we all expect from Disney now days.  I wouldn't recommend anyone see this in the theatre.  Wait for it to be shown for free at a birthday party or something.","true":true}
