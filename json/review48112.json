Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movies wasn't perfect I loved it and it deserves more then the 52% it got at the time of this writing. Better and more original than the carbon copy of previous films of its predecessor.","true":true}
