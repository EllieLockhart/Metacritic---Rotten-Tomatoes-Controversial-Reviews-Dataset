Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a boring\\, cliche mess of a movie. The first half of this movie (Up until Finn and Rose get picked up by the bandit) Is a great example of Disney's Ignorance of making a good movie. I wanted to got to sleep during the first half. Also\\, Rose is worse than Jar Jar. The Second Half improves but still has cliche and boring elements.","true":true}
