Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"E9 can fix the disappointment by giving us a 'flashbak' scene of Luke taking on and defeating the knights of Ren before he goes into exile. After all\\, the biggest let-down of e8 wass that we didn't get to really see Luke as a Jedi Master wielding his green lightsaber - this is what fans were waiting for. As an aside\\, let's have Lando back in e9! More of C3-PO and R2 -- less of BB8. would love to know who snoke was\\, just pick a character from 4\\, 5\\, or 6! such as...janus greejatus!","true":true}
