Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Daisy Ridley\\, John Boyega\\, Mark Hamill\\, Adam Driver\\, Andy Serkis\\, Domnhall Gleeson\\, Carrie Fisher and the rest of the cast was excellent. Star Wars The Last Jedi was extremely entertaining\\, action-packed\\, and funny. It was just as good as The Force Awakens. Good job Rian Johnson !!!!!!!! 8\/10","true":true}
