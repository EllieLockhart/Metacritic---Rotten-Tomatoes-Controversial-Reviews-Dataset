Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is a spectacle which hasn't been since the The Empire Strikes Back. I understand there is a lot of mix reviews regarding it's plot. I also understand how near-impossible it is to please all the Star Wars Fanbase. Rian does a terrific job here and takes risks with the franchise unlike J.J. who just rehashes a New Hope with Force Awakens. I myself would've liked to see more Dark Side influence in the movie\\, but it's the story of the Resistance and their place in the galaxy. Overall\\, I give Last Jedi a solid 4 and a half stars. It's not perfect but it's also not what a lot of salty people have marked it up as either. \\n\\nThings I would've liked to have seen: \\n\\nMore Phasma influence. For such a bad-ass as she's portrayed as in the most recent book\\, she left much to be desired for as a character in this particular movie. \\n\\nA more deep-dive into who or what Snoke is. \\n\\nOverall\\, I recommend this film as a must-see for any Star Wars Fan.","true":true}
