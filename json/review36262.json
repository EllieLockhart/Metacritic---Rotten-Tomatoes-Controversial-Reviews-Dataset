Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Straw\\, more like it. \\n\\nSo what do you get when you sit in a group and everyone comes up with one spectacular visual firework and then silence ensues when they have to figure out who to string it all together ... well\\, until someone comes up with the idea of a two hour long space-chase -> Star Wars: The last Jedi \\nLet's assume for a moment that it is entirely realistic that in the three-dimensional void of space the only way to catch a ship is by chasing after it and that you can't just jump a few parsecs (to stay on Star Wars lingo) ahead in its path. Or that there is no other ship in your Armada that could pursue them from a different angle and lure them into a trap. Well\\, then of course it all works. \\nThough\\, wait a minute\\, how does a group of people manage to leave the fleeing ships\\, stage a horse race in a fictional version of Monte Carlo for no reason\\, and then return but none of the pursuers can seem to get close enough? Well\\, because they can. \\nAnd all the while we are treated to a young apprentice of the force who does\\, or doesn't\\, get her training - this is still not quite clear.But she seems proficient enough to take it up with a dark knight of extensive training. Maybe there is such a thing as 'natural talent' among the Jedi no matter how snotty the council always had seemed to get when it came to training. I guess Ray could alway take an 'online course' seeing how multi-dimensional Luke can be. \\nBut the most mind-boggling part is that the movie could've been actually much more consistent with the help of smarter editing. For example: It makes absolutely no sense that after chasing the resistance from their base and across the galaxy the First Order would stage a ground assault when half their fleet has just been obliterated by the most (not so) awesome Kamikaze manoeuvre in the history of Star Wars. In the grander scheme of pacing it would've made much more sense to start off with the ground battle since the similarities to 'The Empire Strikes Back' are in your face already anyways. And once that's done the plot could've easily segwayed into the grand chase. But I guess it wouldn't have made sense to have Luke Skywalker there to battle Ren then ... not that it did the way it was done in the end.\\nAlso\\, due to the sad departure of Carrie Fisher in the last year\\, it would've made much more sense to move Kylo Ren's attack on the Raddus towards the end of the movie\\, marking Princess Leia's ultimate departure from the series with a plausible and emotional gravitating bang. Even more so since all the scenes are there already anyways. Now we can only wait and see what 'creative' way they'll explain her absence in Episode IX with\\, or what crazy special effects they'll use to keep her in.\\n \\nAll in all The last Jedi is once more an example of how far the industry has come concerning special effects\\, spectacle and emotions and how much it has lost in the aspect of coherent and smart story-telling. What could've been a great movie is left as a bunch of cinematic CG shots strung together by a wayward storyline.","true":true}
