Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been watching Star Wars since I was a kid and I thought the worse Star Wars movies were the prequels. Well all that changed when I saw the Last Jedi. I was so excited when I went to go and see this movie and then I was just so disappointed. Spoilers Almost nothing made sense. Characters went against their nature. There were so many plot holes. Luke would never of tried to kill Kylo. Luke worked so hard to save his dad and now he would just turn his back on his way of thinking. I think not. The bombs on the ships would not of fallen down they would of stayed in place. They also added to many jokes. Luke milking that creature on the plant was unnecessary and stupid. The kid at the end of the movie just out of the blue using the force to grab a broom. Complete bull crap. It took Luke years to master the force and how to use it. This movie was a utter disappointment! ","true":true}
