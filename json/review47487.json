Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is the deal with the critics high score for this film? Where is the story? The prequel films that fans tend to hate on have an actual story unlike this film which seems to have one purpose in mind to destroy the characters from the Original Trilogy. In other words this film's goal is to assassinate the character of Luke Skywalker and once that is accomplished to end him in a whimper. Rian Johnson in his arrogance ignored the outline created by JJ Abrams for the sequel trilogy in favor of his \\\"vision\\\" and to hell with what the fans want or deserve. I have been a fan of Star Wars ever since my Dad first introduced me to the Original Trilogy on vhs. I remember going to see the Special Editions of the original trilogy in theaters with my Dad and sister and the prequels. Yes\\, the prequels had issues\\, but they were still Star Wars and I still enjoy watching them just like the originals. I even enjoy watching the Clone Wars and Rebels. This film however is not Star Wars and will probably destroy the franchise if episode 9 doesn't manage to repair the damage caused by the director's interpretation of the Star Wars universe or lack thereof.","true":true}
