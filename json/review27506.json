Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I loved it. Any scenes that involved Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren quickly became my favorites. The casino side quest was the only low point\\, but it's nice to see Disney taking risks instead of always pandering to what the fanbase *thinks* should happen. If the Force Awakens was a treat for the original fans who felt cheated by the prequels\\, then The Last Jedi was the baton pass to the newer generation of fans\\, and honestly\\, I'm both excited and optimistic to see where the galaxy far\\, far away takes us from here. :)","true":true}
