Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that Star Wars fans should demand a remake of this film. Why not? If you order food at a restaurant and its not served the way you like you send it back to the kitchen. Well\\, this film is no different. To be fair\\, there were some good scenes that were interesting and enjoyable to watch. However\\, there were just too many mistakes made in this film. Many of the dramatic and emotional moments fell flat while other elements of the story were rushed and left unexplained. Its obvious that the writer\/director didn't like Luke Skywalker. It showed throughout the depiction of the character. In addition\\, it feels as if the saga was hijacked in order to provide fans with a way out to make way for a new and different story line. Its not that new story development are a bad thing\\, but it was too much too fast. The film simply took too many liberties for a story as loved and cherished as Star Wars. So i'll repeat:\\, it was a nice try\\, but try again. I think the fans deserve a remake.","true":true}
