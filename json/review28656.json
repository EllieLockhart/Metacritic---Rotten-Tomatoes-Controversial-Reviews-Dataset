Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros: visually great. Great CGI sets etc\\, what you would expect from a big budget star wars film. Good space battles and action scenes Cons: Story was awful. You could take Finns arc out and the movie would be the same. Absolutely ruined Luke's story. Walked out feeling like I watched an episode of Lost but set in space. So many plot holes\\, no character development\\, no questions answered from episode 7. Edit: the more I think about it\\, the angrier I get. Anger leads to more hate. Do not understand where this is going anymore besides downhill. ","true":true}
