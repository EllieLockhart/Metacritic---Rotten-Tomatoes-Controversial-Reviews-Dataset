Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow where to start. This film made me hate Star Wars. It was a shit show of epic proportions. This wasn't about the old Star Wars characters. Chewie and R2D2 were barely in it. They made Luke into a joke. Snoke was the best character and he was killed way too quickly. Kylo Ren got his ass handed to him by Rey and he is suppose to be the next Vader? Please! I despise Rian Johnson for this debacle of a movie. Where did the First Order come from? No back story for any of the characters. How weak was Captain Phasma? Critics have lost all credibility. 91%? Hahaha that is some funny stuff. The Royal Guard was laughable with their work out routine. Dumb jokes\\, why kill off Ackbar? No reason to watch the last movie. I would watch Phantom Menace 100 times out of 100 instead of this!","true":true}
