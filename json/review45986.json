Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive as always\\, Rian Johnson's take on Star Wars is unique and refreshing! The character development of Rey and Ben Solo is particularly strong. Definitely some crazy twists I did not see coming. The action sequences are breathtaking\\, and are some of the best in Star Wars history! I cannot wait to see where the next movie takes us in this saga!!","true":true}
