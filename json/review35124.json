Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u201cThe force awakens is just a new hope rip off waaaaahhhh\u201d \u201cThe last Jedi doesn\u2019t feel like Star Wars it\u2019s too different wasaaahhhhh\u201d The movie is awesome\\, I enjoyed it and the story. Can\u2019t wait to see where Abrams takes it. ","true":true}
