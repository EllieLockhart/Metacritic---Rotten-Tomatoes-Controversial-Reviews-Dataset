Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't feel like a retread of the previous trilogies\\, and it took some risks. The storytelling was phenomenal and the acting was on point. This is such a fun and likeable cast. Very satisfied with the direction this is going. Can't wait for the conclusion!","true":true}
