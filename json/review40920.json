Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroyed the original trilogy\\, it completely ignored the tone set in The Force Awakens\\, Snoke is killed but you learn nothing of him\\, Then Luke Skywalker trying to kill his nephew\\, This leads me to think Rian Johnson born in 1973 DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE. and he did not listen to Mark Hamil\\, how in the world could Luke try to kill Ben Solo??  And all the  '4th Wall\\\" \\\"This Is not going to go the way you think\\\" That was for the audience. \\\"Forget the past\\, Kill it leave it in the past\\\"  All Rian Johnson talking to the audience.  Well I say Mr. Johnson\\, \\\"Your Lake of faith in the franchise is disturbing\\\" \t\\n\\\"You mean like when an actor stops interacting with the scene he is in\\, and instead address the audience directly?\\\"","true":true}
