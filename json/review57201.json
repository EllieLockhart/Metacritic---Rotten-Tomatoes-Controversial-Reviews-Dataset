Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest entry into the Star Wars cinematic universe is a love it or hate it kind of film. By that of course I mean there's moments and ideas you'll love as well as moments and ideas you'll absolutely hate. It definitely improves upon many of the aspects the Force Awakens lacked with a variety of settings and more engaging action sequences. With that in mind\\, it still proves to be more of a disappointment in killing off important characters needlessly like Admiral Ackbar and Snoke while introducing others that make you scratch your head as to why they're even there with the character of Rose managing to be more detestable than Jar Jar Binks. Furthermore\\, it features so many plot-holes and unnecessary story elements that it makes the film more frustrating in reflection than it should've been. Nonetheless\\, its amazing special effects\\, beautiful production design and heart-pumping score by John Williams save this film from its poor writing. Overall\\, it is a necessary though unsatisfying watch for the progression of Star Wars storyline.","true":true}
