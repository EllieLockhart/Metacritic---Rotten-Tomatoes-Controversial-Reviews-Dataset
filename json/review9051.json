Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full Disclosure - I'm a Star Trek Fan.\\n\\nThat being said\\, however - I've genuinely enjoyed EVERY Star Wars movie (including the original 3 - not being attached to the fandom allowed me to enjoy these films in their at the time state of the art CGI and big budget glory).\\n\\nHowever - this film.. I cannot abide.\\n - \\\"Trigger Happy flyboy\\\" is a line actually used in this film\\n - Slapstick humor\\, the \\\"Disneyfication\\\" that ruined Guardians of the Galaxy 2\\, is strong with this one.\\n - THERE IS NO SOUND IN SPACE. However\\, in the Star Wars universe there is excessive sound in space but an AT-AT on Salt plains makes no sound whatsoever.\\n\\nThere's more after the spoilers BUT suffice it to say - the one element of this film that\\, going in\\, I believed I'd hate was the only one I truly enjoyed. \\n\\nI want to see a film with just the Porgs.\\n\\n[SPOILERS]\\n\\n - Apparently skywalkers can bring themselves back to life.\\n - Luke commits suicide (? like\\, honestly wtf - he projects himself onto the battlefield so he can't be killed then just vanishes??? IS IT THE MIIDICHLORIANS??)","true":true}
