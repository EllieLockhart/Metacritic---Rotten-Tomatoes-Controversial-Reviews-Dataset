Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid\\, this was awesome to watch. I was worried due to previous bad reviews but I feel that Star Wars fans can be a little too judgmental. The story arc can change. I think that the move was well made and they made good decisions with the characters. Overall it is just fun to watch. ","true":true}
