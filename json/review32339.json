Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars hyper fans are more divided more than ever. This is the first time I seriously have issues with the last jedi haters. I usually respect other persons' opinions\\, but the haters are just ramming their opinions and actively trying to sway on the people who loved it. Claiming a true star wars fans wouldn't love it\\, claiming that is not how luke skywalker should be and Disney ruins star wars. Stop that! This is the best Mark Hamill's performance\\, Disney is doing fine with starwars except them dealing with the movie theater and monopolizing film industry. I love the movie\\, it's on par with empire strikes back and more people should just enjoy last jedi.","true":true}
