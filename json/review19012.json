Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's disgusting to think that this movie is in the same franchise as the original trilogy. This movie is not even funny\\, they try to hide their failures by blaming man for not supporting feminism or just saying that they are toxic and \\\"do not understand the movie\\\". Honestly just because there are plot twist in it it doesn't make it automatically good! I could talk about the mistakes for hours\\, but to summarize it I say it's a bad movie with a thon of incredible visual effects.","true":true}
