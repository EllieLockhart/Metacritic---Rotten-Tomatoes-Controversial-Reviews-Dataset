Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"formulaic\\, overly long\\, heavy handed PC cultural diversity\\, plot twists that are contrived and nonsensical\\, so unoriginal\\, Kylo Ren is just a snotty teen ager in no way threatening or believable. what a 3 hour waste of screen time!","true":true}
