Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars Movie by far\\, I cant consider this Canon. This movie is not just bad it also damage the rest of the movies with its physics (hyperspace ramming??\\, seriusly??) and the chararcter development (Rey overpower with no need of training\\, the director doesnt understand Luke at all\\, what a waste....  the new characters are boring\\, etc... This is just really poor writing and no respect for the franchise).\\n\\nLooks like Star Wars\\, sounds like Star Wars but its not Star Wars\\, at least not for me.","true":true}
