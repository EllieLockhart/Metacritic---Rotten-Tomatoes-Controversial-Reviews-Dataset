Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not really a Star Wars movie. This is a Disney movie that misappropriates SW characters for an overly long series of mostly pointless vignettes strung together by inconsistencies and gaping plot holes. Along the way it \\\"develops the character\\\" of Luke to show him preparing to kill his sleeping nephew for fear Kylo would go to the Dark Side\\, despite young Luke having been defined by his refusal to kill Vader who was already on the Dark Side because of the belief he could still change.","true":true}
