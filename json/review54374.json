Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to admit. I was entertained\\, but conflicted. Ultimately\\, i knew it was because of my expectations of where I thought those characters should go vs how they ended up going. So all during the day after\\, the more and more i got on board with it. The second viewing allowed me to really enjoy it since i was now ok with where they took the characters. Were there issues? Of course. There are with any movie (ans some more than others... AOTC). Still\\, like it\\, hate it\\, we're getting movies every year now. Also\\, I'm perfectly fine with these new ones working with the kids growing up now as the OT did for me and the prequels did for my kids (who quote Episode 3 lines constantly). Bring on the next one!!","true":true}
