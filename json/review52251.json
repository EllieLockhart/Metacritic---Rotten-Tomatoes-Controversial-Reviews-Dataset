Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fun scifi\/adventure story. Unfortunately it adds nothing of real value to the series overall and instead continues the trend of rehashing previous events\/characters. For a long film with a gigantic budget\/cast\/crew\\, the film feels rather sparse and uneventful.","true":true}
