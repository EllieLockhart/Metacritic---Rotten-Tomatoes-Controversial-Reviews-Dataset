Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with TLJ is not that it betrays the diehard fans' expectations and far-fetched theories. The problem is that it fails to deliver a story that works on a fundamental level. Red herrings leading to meaningless plot twists all over the place; characters that instead of developing since TFA become more wooden and predictable; lame diversions and subplots that change absolutely nothing; plot holes and implausible 'miracles' that defy the tone and rules of the Star Wars universe; anticlimactic results of almost every action taken by the protagonists; continuous attempts to ridicule even the most dramatic moments; waste of beloved and potentially compelling characters for no reason. \\n\\nCertain elements of the core concept (the whole 'duality' theme of Rey-Kylo\\, Luke as a bitter hermit that needs to redeem himself\\, etc) are not that bad\\, but the way they were explored makes TLJ a beautifully crafted and excellently promoted blockbuster with a script any stoned undergrad film student could write in a weekend.","true":true}
