{"101487":152593,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker\\, the saviour of our beloved galaxy and hero of the alliance\\, who still saw some light in space hitler (vader)\\, just tries to kill his nephew for having \\\"evil thoughts\\\". Ben isn't even as near as evil or lost as anakin ever was - Luke\\, not even trying to help him out\\, choses the path his daddys former master once has chosen: kill him of. in his sleep. \\n\\nLet's not forget\\, that due to Rian Johnson\\, Luke becomes as a Jedi Master even more naive\\, immature than before his training. Ignoring his legacy\\, he just leaves all trouble by choosing to die as a milk-drinking hermit on a lonely island. Why in the hell he gave Lor San Tekka and R2 a map\\, so that someone can find him? On of the vast of questions\\, the movie isn't able to answer. \\nHis behaviour on crait is so off-character\\, his little hair-chat with Leia is awkward and out of place. The matrix-like dodge fight is.. I do not have any words for this. \\n\\nI see the intention of 'Floating Leia'\\, but this was the most dumbest way to realize it. In my opinion very disrespectful to this character. Yes\\, she has Skywalker blood and so on\\, but we had 6 previous movies\\, in which the characters in TLJ seem like  god-like superheroes among the jedi or force-users. Totally off-canon. \\n\\nWhere are my beloved resistance pilots like Wex\\, Pav\\, Lek; where's Admiral Statura? \\nRian Johnson doesn't care about these through TFA and canon material (like the Poe Dameron comics) developed characters. No\\, instead he just replaces them with his own. \\n\\nJohnsons lack of understanding and ignorance towards the established characters\\, shows once again in the cheap deaths of Supreme Leader Snoke and Captain Phasma. \\n\\nSnoke is such an powerful being (to me he seems more powerful than even the Emperor)\\, who sees \\\"everything\\\"\\, manipulate anyone... and he doesn't see his death coming?! Again\\, this is kind of off-character.\\nYou just can't write a character\\, who is described as the most powerful being and not even trying to explain all this\\, and kill him of in such a cheap manner. \\n\\nPhasma turns out to be a throw-away character - I see how much of a Star Wars fan Rian Johnson must be. (note: sacracsm)\\n\\nLet's not forget about Maz ... Well\\, let's forget about that. \\n\\nThe Finn and Tico plot on Canto Bight is so unnecessary to the plot\\, it hurts to even rethink about it. It's such a waste to lavish Del Toro on another such unlikeable throw-away character.\\n\\n\\nIn the 'Force Awakens' the First Order was introduced as a worthy\\, menacing\\, competent legal successor from the Empire - RJ potrayed Hux and his fellows instead just like the retarded trolls from 'Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears'. \\nPoe's prank call\\, that mother joke; a Dreadnought without any shields - all of that is in contradiction of the threat\\, which is proclaimed throughout the movie.\\nAlso the cheap marvel-humour takes out all the sincerity of the plot.       \\n\\nLet's stay in that 'Gummi Bear' analogy for a moment:\\nThe peak of the ludicrousness of the FO is reached after Kylo aka Duke Ightorn joins his right hand Toadie (Hux) and commands all units to fire at one guy. \\n\\nRian Johnson fullfills his ignorance to the previous Star Wars moves by completely ignoring the introduced storyarcs. Where are the Knights of Ren? What about Kylo's training that should be finished\\, what about the Republic? \\n\\nThere are plenty of other things that bother me\\, the wound is still fresh\\, I still can't talk about all of that\\, but before I start to talk about the things I liked about the movie I have to adress space battles:\\n\\n\\nAfter the release of Rogue One\\, I realized that these parts are the most important ones. Even more important than lightsaber duels (only my subjective perception). They get my tension high\\, the encourage me; I watch them with joy - to cut things short: they define Star Wars. \\nTherefore I am very disappointed about the space physics. Shields never worked that way in Star Wars like they did in 'The Last Jedi'\\, the Resistance bombers are so backwarded and illogical. Worst space combat since 'Star Wars Rebels'. \\n\\n\\nOf course there are things that are really likeable about this movie.\\n\\nI like the world-building\\, the new creatures\\, Luke's (right and long awaited) interpretation of the Jedi Order\\, the set design\\, some characters like Finn and Rey (I really loved Kylo till 'TLJ')\\, but all of that can't reduce my immeasureable disappointment about this movie. \\n\\nDeactivating some superweapon's shield\\, a fleeing rebel fleet\\, etc. are no new plot devices for the Star Wars franchise. The movie feels just \\\"different\\\" because he doesn't care about the characters and storyarc's of the prequel-\\, original- or even sequel trilogies. I see here another rehash\\, which feels more a bit of strange fan fiction. \\n\\nAs someone who learned to adore 'The Force Awakens' and as strong defender of the new canon\\, I feel trapped and misleaded. It's no wonder fired director Trevorrow couldn't write a good script out of that mess Rian Johnson left for his successor. \\n\\nWhat's worse than one of your favourite dircetor's\\, the guy who made 'Brick' and 'Looper'\\, destroys your favourite franchise - how am I supposed to feel? The nothingness that rised up last wednesday after the movie is still present. I can't believe that this really happened.\\n\\nI am so confused\\, because I never wanted to be one of that guys who hated the shit out of a movie\\, like they did 18 years ago with the 'TPM' or 'TFA' 2 years ago\\, but now... I'm shocked. I try to like this movie\\, but it just doesen't seem to work.\\n\\nDark times has come. Into exile I must go.","true":true}
