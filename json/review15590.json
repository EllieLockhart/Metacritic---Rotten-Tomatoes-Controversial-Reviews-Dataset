Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved The Last Jedi\\, it is unlike any Star Wars film that came before it.  The Last Jedi delivers epic and unexpected moments while serving up moments to please long time fans.  \\n\\nKylo Ren is proving to be one of the best and most complex characters in Star Wars cannon and his story arc in The Last Jedi is incredible.  \\n\\nLuke Skywalker was fantastic in this film\\, I loved his jaded and new outlook on what it means to be a Jedi and you are served up a brief history moment showing that Luke was still walking the line between the light and dark side just like in Return Of The Jedi.   We also get an epic moment showing Luke to be the most powerful force user in Star Wars by using a new power never seen before.\\n\\nI also really enjoyed the character development of Rey and Finn as they both start to learn their place in what's going on around them and significantly grow beyond their narrow motives from The Force Awakens.\\n\\nWhile I loved what they did I can see why some wouldn't as where the film goes with its characters and story it shatters all expectations people brought with them from The Force Awakens.","true":true}
