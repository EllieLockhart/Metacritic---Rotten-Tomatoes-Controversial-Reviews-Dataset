Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my all time favorite Star Wars movie. Everything  about it makes me so happy and the deeper meanings shown throughout the film are really eye opening and really gets you thinking. I feel like this story is a breath of fresh air for the Star Wars universe. It makes me sad that people didn't understand and disliked the scenes we got in this film. I really feel as though it is not as bad as people make it out to be and feel like if you really look at the imagery and ideas put forth in the film you can learn to love it. God bless Arian Johnson.","true":true}
