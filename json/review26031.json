Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not my favorite at all. The draw of Star Wars for me was a simple story of good versus evil and great characters. The stories have become dark and convoluted with weak stories. Probably my last Star Wars movie.","true":true}
