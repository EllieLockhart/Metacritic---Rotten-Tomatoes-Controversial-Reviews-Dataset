Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the original Star Wars movie on its release weekend back in the 1970's and have seen every movie since.  This movie ranks in my top 3 of all the movies in the Star Wars universe.  It is the bridge to the next set of movies for this great franchise.  Old characters are gone or fade to lesser roles while new ones are introduced and step forward to greater roles.  Not sure why \\\"fans\\\" hate this or what they were expecting but IMHO it was one of the best in the franchise and well done to set the stage for what is to come.","true":true}
