Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am highly disappointed in this movie. Spoilers ahead:\\nThe movie utilizes one of the worst MacGuffins i have ever seen. The First Order chases the Resistance ships in regular space until their fuel will eventually run out\\, because both fleets have the exact same speed and are barely out of theirs weapons effective reach. None of the three Star Destroyers makes the jump to hyperspace to get ahead and attack from the front\\, but Finn and Rose have no problems leaving on a small vessel\\, taking a trip to a completely pointless casino-world and come back to the fleet. In the end\\, in a desperate attempt to save the rescue capsules\\, the resistance turns their corvette around and rams it into snoke's command ship - at light speed no less - and shatteres half the enemy fleet. Why aren't there any hyperspace torpedoes if this works that well. Why didn't they use one of the smaller ships before to do the exact same thing? \\n\\nThen there is the reoccurring theme of defying the viewers expectations\\, which is a nice idea in itself\\, but having Rey's parentage\\, Luke\\, the Code-Cracker mission\\, Snoke's laughable death and many more things be completely pointless is just a let down. Each of those would have been fine individually\\, if the rest of the story would back it up. Not everything needs to be resolved immediately\\, but you get no answers and the more this happens\\, the more it feels like a giant middle finger to the audience and casual fans especially.\\n\\nThe characters aren't fleshed out and become more of a cliche. The only interesting villain is killed of almost as a side note and his potential adversary\\, the one Jedi everybody knows and loves basically dies of old age and exhaustion - half a galaxy away from the action.\\n\\nOh and then there is the uplifting ending\\, where we get to know that the resistance now has lots of new child soldiers that will fight for them.\\n\\nI honestly have no idea\\, why critics seemed to love the movie this much. Granted\\, while watching it\\, you do have a blast - although suspense of disbelief ist really hard to achieve. But once you leave the theatre and think more than two minutes about the movie\\, you just get angrier and angrier.","true":true}
