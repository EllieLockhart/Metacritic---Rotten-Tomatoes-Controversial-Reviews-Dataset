Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good things about the new Star Wars:\\n\\nVisually it's great work! I can't remember that I have ever seen such poor story-telling look so good.\\nIf you are able to turn off your brain except the region for visual satisfaction... this is your movie!\\n\\nAnother good thing about The last Jedi: It makes the prequels look like solid Star Wars-Artwork. \\n\\nWell\\, and finally Jar Jar isn't the most unnecessary character in the Star Wars-Universe anymore! That's great!\\nWe've got Purple Hair now! And Rose! And the Porgs!\\n\\nLet's face it: Star Wars is dead...\\n\\nIt's STAR PORGS now!","true":true}
