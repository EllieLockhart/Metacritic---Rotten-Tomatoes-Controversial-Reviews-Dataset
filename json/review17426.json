Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie twice and thought it was even better the second time.\\nI disagree with the 'Popcorn\\\" fan reviews.I\\,m sure Yoda would agree.Yoda: a Star Wars fan does not crave these Popcorn things.predictabilty\\,huuumph\\,Nostalgia\\,hummph.A Star Wars fan has the deepest commitment\\,the mot serious following.You must see this movie twice\\,to complete you training\\,complete your training.","true":true}
