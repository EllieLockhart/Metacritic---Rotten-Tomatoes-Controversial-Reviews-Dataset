Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a travesty. Visuals for the most part good\\, music good\\, the rest has been well documented by the audience reviews. Too many bad parts to waste time naming. Worst thing of all was destroying the previous SW legacy for no good reason except\\, I can only guess\\, to say because we can?","true":true}
