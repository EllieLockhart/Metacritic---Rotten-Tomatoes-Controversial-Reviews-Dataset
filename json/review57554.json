Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm embarrassed to admit that it called itself \\\"Star Wars\\\". At so many points in the movie\\, my brain was bouncing all over between unnecessary characters and what path they would take. The movie was even worse than that of it's predecessor \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, which in itself was shameful enough. What a waste of my time and money.","true":true}
