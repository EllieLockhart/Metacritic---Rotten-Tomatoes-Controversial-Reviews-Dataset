Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A better \\\"movie\\\" than any of the other Star Wars movies and this review is being written after seeing Episode IX. The only Star Wars movie that solidly expresses it's theme. As a sequel it succeeds by expanding on the world and intentionally rejecting the same old tropes regurgitated by the previous movies (especially Episode VII). The only reason it isn't getting 5 stars from me is because of the opening bomber scene which doesn't make any sense at all.","true":true}
