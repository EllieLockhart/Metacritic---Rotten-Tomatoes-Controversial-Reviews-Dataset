Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think it was very good. Not the best movie I've seen but definitely the best Star Wars movie of them all. It's well written\\, the characters all well developed and the story pays off. It's normal that it angries a lot of fans\\, specially the nostalgic ones\\, but all and all\\, and leaving personal wants aside\\, it is a solid movie that a lot of people will enjoy in the future.","true":true}
