Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was great. The people on here that say they didn't like it I think just had expectations of a storyline in their mind. It wasn't hard to follow at all\\, maybe they are slow. Awesome movie very entertaining. Maybe go into a movie with less expectation of what you think it should be. Freaking awesome in my book","true":true}
