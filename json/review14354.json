Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I guess the director of this movie believes in rewriting or ignoring history\\, huh?  This movie just pisses on everything that comes before it.  And\\, not just The Force Awakens\\, but the original triology as well.  He rewrote Luke's character and history and completely gave a big middle finger to every story line TFA set up.\\n\\nWell\\, how's that working for you?  Lowest ratings by audience of all Star Wars movies and that includes the prequels.  \\n\\nMoral of the story: Don't shit on your golden egg.","true":true}
