Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great deal of expectation was placed on this movie in answering questions that were created in the prior film. Most of these questions were left unanswered and the plot holes created gave a lack of confidence in what the following film will now provide. The movie provides good visuals\\, great acting\\, and beautiful scenes which all become lackluster due to the poorly written story. The previous film set episode VIII up for great movement and depth which were in this fans eyes wasted and thrown to the curb. It seems the director\/writer had the hope of bringing something \\\"different\\\" and \\\"unexpected\\\" (which is fine in its own sense) but lacked a well thought out story with increasing intrigue for its follow up.","true":true}
