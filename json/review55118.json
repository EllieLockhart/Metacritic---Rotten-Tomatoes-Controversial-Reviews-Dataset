Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i was hopeful.  I was not a huge fan of the force awakens\\, but i figured this would be better.  in the first scene there was a \\\"YO MAMA\\\" joke\\, i knew it was going to be bad!  after disney erased the expanded universe\\, i was curious what was in stor for luke.  well... i wish now i could forget.  \\n\\nmark hamill himself was commenting on how bad luke was handled in this.  i don't care that he died\\, i figured that was in the cards.  how is him being a loser\\, quitter\\, nephew murdering\\, a-hole even possible?  this isn't the luke from the original trilogy.  \\n\\nkilling off snoke was terrible as well.  kylo ren is not a compelling villain.  jj has his work cut out for him.  rey has already bested ren.    beating him again is pretty dang anti-climatic.  there is so much other stuff wrong with this.  just skip this and pretend it never happened.  just pretend that the luke in the expanded universe is the luke that exists.  this movie is a pile of garbage.","true":true}
