Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A simple error which has not been noticed by anyone until now\\, but is so HUGE that\\, once you see it\\, you will shit bricks:\\n\\nAdmiral Holdo (AKA Purple Hair Gender Studies in a Party Dress)\\, having seen all of the rebellion (sorry\\, resistance\\, albait the two terms are not synonyms) ships destroyed but the one with her lover Princess (sorry\\, General. Nobility is bad as much as wealth and being male and\/or white) Leia\\, decides to sacrifice herself and the Raddus by lightspeed-ramming Snokes's ship.\\n\\nCool. Incredible visual spectacle. \\n\\nPeople defending this by saying: \\\"Since no one came up with this idea before\\, it should be considered as a genial and impromptu invention of admiral Holdo. No one did it in the preceding 7 (SEVEN) movies simply because no one thought about it.\\\"\\n\\nmmmmKey. The IQ in the galaxy far far away was really low then. And also that of George Lucas and J.J. Abrams... right Rian? \\n\\nSo... why is General Hux SCARED TO DEATH when he realizes what Holdo is doing? Why does he yell to his subordinates to destroy that ship on the spot? Without lightspeed\\, the Raddus would have simply crashed on the shields of Snoke's ship without causing any damage AT ALL.\\n\\n(We have seen it in Rogue One\\, when the Empire ships jump out of hyperspace really near to the rebellion ships which were about to leave the scene\\, the rebellion ships ram into the Empire ships and are completely obliterated without even scratching them.)\\n\\nHux CLEARLY knows that she will destroy Snoke's ship with that manouver. This means that HE KNOWS that manouver. Even his subordinates know it!\\n\\nSo\\, WHY THE HELL didn't he or anyone else use it before?\\n\\nMaybe because all 7 preceding movies would then have lasted 5 minutes???\\n\\nRian Johnson is as incompetent as lazy and this error only demonstrates it abundantly. \\n\\nHe should have had Hux laughing at the poor attempt of Holdo\\, thus showing that he did not know that lightspeed-ramming a ship would completely destroy it.","true":true}
