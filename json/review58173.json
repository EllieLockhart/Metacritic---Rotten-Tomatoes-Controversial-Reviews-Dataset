{"101487":199767,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes fans have to move on but\\,Snokes poor death it is he dead is he not Zzzzz. Luke not getting to fight and see his powers. Leia flying in outer space. Luke dying \\,phasma getting killed so easily also. Is she dead or not again Zzzzz. The Finn\/rose story. Pointless \\nKylo using Jedi FaceTime to speak to Rey.  \\nVery disappointing film for this guy","true":true}
