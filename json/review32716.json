Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d movie \ud83c\udfa5 review: The story picks up where the \u201cforce awakens\u201d left off. With every bit of emotion and passion\\, the story unfolds from the old to the new. What a great transition to past on the torch from the classic series to its new predecessors. I thought Mark Himill was brilliant and his character\u2019s development to bringing something from the past too ending with something new was awesome\\, yet sad. I must admit it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting\\, which is also why I liked it. The intensity of the story kept climaxing one after the another. Some of the scenes did feel rushed or short lived like the fighting scene between Finn and Capt. Phasma. I give this film a 9 out of 10. A solid A-.","true":true}
