Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's amazing how this movie managed to be the only piece of star wars that feels out of place\\, it ignored estabilished rules and common sense so many times. Even outside of the Star Wars setting it fails to stand on it's own.","true":true}
