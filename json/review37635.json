Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is \\\"subverting expectations\\\" and there's just \\\"doing it wrong\\\".  Break every technical rule established by our silly universe thusfar? Check\\, (I'm not talking about new force powers\\, I'm talking about the way turbolasers and capital ships work); point A to point B to point A plot that managed to accomplish nothing except desecrate the memory of some beloved characters? Check; Tone deaf slapstick worthy of a Disney animated feature? Check; Shoehorned in token character with absolutely no arc or purpose other than being a token character? Check; (Seriously\\, a strong\\, skilled Asian woman in Star Wars would be awesome... shame we have to settle for a placeholder until she shows up); Completely flipping off the fan base's questions about the previous movies? Yes indeed. Rian is quoted as saying the reason the Knights of Ren are not in this film was that \\\"there simply wasn't room in the story...\\\" and yet there was room for that pointless jaunt through Canto Bight. I desperately hope Disney sits up and takes notice.. and the actual heavenly bodies realign before we have an entire trilogy foisted on us in the same vein.","true":true}
