Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm in awe that many fans didn't like this movie. Not only did it succeed in not regurgitating the same plot over again the way Episode VII did\\, but it also made nods to the original books and displayed force powers fitting of a bloodline born of the Force. They didn't rehash the story but instead took the blueprint and evolved it.  Watch the movie if you're a fan\\, because you'll love it. If you're a young millennial who has only seen the prequels\\, and later watched the original and didn't like it\\,  this probably isn't the movie for you.","true":true}
