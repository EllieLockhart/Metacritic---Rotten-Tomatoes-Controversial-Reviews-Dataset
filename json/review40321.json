Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the most mature space operas I\u2019ve seen. It has some gripes worthy of a made for TV movie. But there were also things going on that really opened up Star Wars and made it bigger and better. Star Wars has legs\\, and even if the older fans can\u2019t handle it\\, the younger ones will call this an important film.","true":true}
