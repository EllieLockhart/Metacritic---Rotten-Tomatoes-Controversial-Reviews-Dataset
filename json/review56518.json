Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The half star is for Mark Hamill's and Oscar Isaac's performance. \\nThis movie is a confusing mess\\, the tone is a disaster\\, the editing is even worse. If you cared about a character... they probably ruined them\\, or hardly show them at all. All this movie proves is that rian Jonson has no idea how to take over a film that he hasn't been writing since the beginning\\, it does nothing story wise and brings nothing but disappointment and confusion to the table. \\nThe few good parts and good performances are heavily over shadowed by the rest\\, and it's almost worse knowing\\n that there was some promise here. And even in cases with mark and Oscar\\, while their performance stands out\\, their actual characters are so poorly put together that it feels like they're playing someone else entirely. \\nThe only good reason to see this film is if you want to rewatch the prequels and feel like you're watching citizen Kane\\, or if your a Star Trek fan whose taking their annoying Star Wars fan friend who won't stop making fun of you for liking Star Trek more so you can break their spirit. :)","true":true}
