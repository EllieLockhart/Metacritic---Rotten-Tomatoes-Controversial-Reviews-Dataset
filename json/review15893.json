Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love this film and I believe the 2nd act is sorely overlooked and underrated in the overall story. \\n\\\"Canto Bite\\\" Not only is it a purposeful\\, stark contrast to the \\\"Cantina Bar\\\" (play on words?probably not but fun to highlight) as in \\\"scum and villainy\\\" are not just exclusive to the broken and dingy ghettos of Mos Eisley\\, but also found in the lavished and luxurious venues of this planet\\, but this part of the film is merely the backdrop for the character development of Finn. He's still a guy on the run as the film starts and Rose and DJ play a moral compass in his development. Rose\\, whose positive and firm in her position in spite of great loss\\, still chooses to stand for something. DJ has an a-moral view of everything in where he flips on a dime because he's looking out for himself. His stuttering plays well into the philosophy that he lives by.  It's unclear and uncertain. I believe to be a brilliant stroke on Rian Johnson's behalf to include that trait. \\n And at a pivotal point in the movie\\, Finn sees how DJ's way only brings about more chaos\\, by turning over info that leads to the near annihilation of the rebels.  At a desperate point in self-preservation and survival\\, DJ casually says to Rose and Finn\\, \\\"Hey they blow you up one day\\, you blow them up the next.\\\" And at the face of execution\\, Finn realizes his philosophy is bad and defiantly tells DJ\\, \\\"You're wrong\\\" solidifying his turn. Now Finn is no longer on the run from something but now believes in something and chooses to stay and fight. Up until this point his going along with the plans alongside Rose was all in the hopes to see Rey again safely. But at this point\\, Finn's position in center\\, Rose's conviction on one side and DJ's beliefs on the other\\, Finn now chooses to be a Rebel Or Rebel Scum as he tells Phasma. Even to the point that when Poe tells him to disengage from the attack on Crait\\, Finn yells\\, \\\"No! I won't let them win!\\\" and willing to sacrifice his own life by ramming that gun. And Rose saving Finn doesn't take away from the intent of his conviction but merely allows him to live long enough to fight with them another day. I could also go on about the depth and layers of Luke in this film but man\\, that's another long essay. I love this film! I cannot express just how much. And being a fan since 77\\, I place TLJ as top 3 Star Wars films of all time. Probably the deepest in layers since ESB.\\nPS I don't get how anyone can complain about physics in Star Wars especially the whole \\\"bomb run\\\" at the start. \\\"Bombs don't fall that way in space\\\" Uh REALLY? I guess with your hate-filled blinders you \\\"conveniently\\\" turn a blind eye to the tie bombers in ESB dropping bombs in an asteroid field....lol. It's a Fantasy movie people! Stop trying to place logic where it cannot exists! LOL","true":true}
