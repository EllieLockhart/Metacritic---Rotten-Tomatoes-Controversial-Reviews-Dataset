Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Someone needs to retitle this \\\"The Last Straw\\\" because that's what it was. When I got home from the theater\\, I pulled all the Star Wars movies made after 1983 off my shelves. I'll enjoy the original trilogy and not waste any more money.","true":true}
