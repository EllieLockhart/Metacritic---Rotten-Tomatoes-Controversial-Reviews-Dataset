Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The way everything hangs together can be a little clunky\\, but overall the themes of the film: what you do with your trauma\\, why to fight\\, when to fight\\, when to resist in other ways\\, etc are v. timely. It's refreshing to see a hoary and oversaturated pop property attempt to communicate distinct themes in a mature manner. Could have been 20 minutes shorter and had 15-20% more creatures. Occasional levity provided relief from some very grim elements and mood. Can't wait for Johnson's trilogy in five years.","true":true}
