Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so disappointed with this film it started bad and the first hour and half I was waiting for it to get better. It feels like they were trying to be smart but it didn't workand the jokes were by far the worst part of it all. It got better towards the end but no real questions were answered. And descions made by characters were quite stupid at times","true":true}
