Unfortunately\\, this is not only a huge disappointment\\, but a colossal middle finger to all the people who played the first game of the series and were moved by its main characters and their relationship. Instead\\, just in the very first act of the game Joel is brutally murdered in an absolutely naive and stupid way by a character that you barely know for 10 minutes\\, and then the game expects you to play as that new character as if nothing happened.\r\rSeriously?\r\rThe ending is also silly and negates virtually everything that the storytellers were trying to preach.\r\rThis is quite possibly the worst game sequel ever made. DO NOT BUY.\r\rDon't even get me started on the copyright strike abuse by MUSO (read: Sony).\r\rP.S. For the people of the \\\"press\\\" and fanboys shouting that all the negative reviews are from bots\\, trolls or homophobic people: the LGBT aspects of the game are completely irrelevant. No one is complaining about that. I don't give a crap that Ellie is a lesbian. We already knew that from the first game's DLC. It's the way the characters are treated and how the story ruined everything from the first one that is the issue. Get it\\, BBC\\, Forbes\\, The Guardian\\, etc.?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
