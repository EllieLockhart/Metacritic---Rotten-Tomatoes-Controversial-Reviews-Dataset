Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a departure from the Skywalker storyline and a commitment to the future. To those stuck in their ways this is a travesty. To those who believe in the mantra \u201cAdapt or Die\u201d it\u2019s a needed change of pace. Mark Hammill is perhaps at his very best as a man who has to come to terms with his abject failure while still being believed to be a savior. To know he set a dark path in motion because he doubted his own resolve. It not trudging the same Luke out to vanquish evil and lead the pack. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s fresh. It\u2019s welcome. And yes\\, it opens up the world of Star Wars to a greater audience. Combine with that the diversity in the cast\\, the lead hero being a heroine and Star Wars now appeals to a greater audience then its core fan base. It positions Star Wars to \u201cReach Out\u201d and create it\u2019s own path rather than let its past forever dominate its destiny. ","true":true}
