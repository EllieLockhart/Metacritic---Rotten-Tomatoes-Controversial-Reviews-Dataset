Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars THE LAST JEDI was a most refreshing and unbelievably exciting sequel. The performances by Mark Hamill and the late\\, great Cary Fischer were absolutely moving and engaging and tears were shed more than once during the film. The story was air-tight and the action non-stop. This film is so well directed and really does the series justice\\, finally after 40 years. The politics of the film were also on par. The military industry and weapons manufacturing being the dark force in the universe\\, that was absolutely spot-on and in line with the spirit of the Star Wars series. And the feminist and gender-balanced representations of characters were breath-taking. A real arrival into a new world for the new generation of Star Wars heroes. One of the best films of the year!","true":true}
