Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A steaming pile of SJW\\, Star Wars ruining\\, plot hole riddled\\, garbage. Mark Hamill was right . The post-modern de-deconstruction and nihilisim in this film is disgusting. Nothing matters and they have absolutely destroyed Star Wars. Down with Disney.","true":true}
