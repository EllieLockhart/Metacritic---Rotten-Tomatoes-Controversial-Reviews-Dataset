Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. Rian Johnson ruined everything JJ Abrams set up in The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi could have been a masterpiece. Yet\\, he turned it into a comedic failure. He should have not been hired to direct this film\\, as he has minimal experience in the film industry.","true":true}
