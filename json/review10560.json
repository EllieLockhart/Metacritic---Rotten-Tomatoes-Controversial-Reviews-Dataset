Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Visuals and action but as far as Star Wars story should have gone? No. Not remotely. Poor character development\\, background Antagonist (Snoke) was taken out of the picture too soon\\, too many goofy scenes that made no sense (green cow milk\\, little flying chickens\\, the island caretakers etc)\\, too many side plots involving unusually political themes (saving animals\\, laura dern's character making references towards arrogant males).  Luke used to be the most optimistic person in the previous story but now is a pessimist. So much wasted potential. Lacking a viable story. This didn't feel like Star Wars at all. ","true":true}
