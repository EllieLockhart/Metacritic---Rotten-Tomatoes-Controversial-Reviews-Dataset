Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into the movie with no expectations. I was not a fan of The Force Awakens. I am a fan of The Last Jedi. There is some poorly placed attempts at humor. There was some hokey spots in the movie. There are answers to your questions. I am not sure if those answers are misdirection or legitimate answers. The Saga is heading into a new direction but it remains Star Wars. With that said\\, embrace the change as we all have to during our lives. The Star Wars Saga is in good hands with Ryan Johnson.","true":true}
