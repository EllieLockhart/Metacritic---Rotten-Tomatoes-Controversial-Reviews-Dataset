Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couldn't disagree more with all the criticism. I think people are just upset with what happened with their childhood hero rather than the movie itself. The movie was fun and very entertaining. The only knock on this was that I felt like the director\/writers had to keep up with too many different characters at once to be able to have a deep and rich storyline.","true":true}
