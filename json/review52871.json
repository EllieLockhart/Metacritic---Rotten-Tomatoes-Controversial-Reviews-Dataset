Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing Movie!\\n\\n- Unpredictable\\n- Most depth out of any SW film\\n- Balanced dcreen time for all characters\\n- Amazing action scenes\\n- Many themes that can be found\\n- Realistic characterization and development","true":true}
