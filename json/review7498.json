Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every now and then a movie happens to the series that is an absolute game changer. In 1980 that movie was The Empire Strikes Back. In 2017 it's The Last Jedi. \\n\\nWhereas JJ Abrams 2015 flick The Force Awakens took absolutely no risks and instead settled on a loose remake of the 1977 original\\, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi takes full advantage of the Star Wars canvas and paints a modern masterpiece of space opera and swashbuckling action. It is nothing more or less than pure escapism and movie magic. It's the reason I go to the movies!","true":true}
