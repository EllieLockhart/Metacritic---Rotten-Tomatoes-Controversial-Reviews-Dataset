Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen the terms \\\"nihilist postmodern deconstruction\\\" used to describe TLJ.\\nAgreed! \\nWhere's the heart? The humanity? The magic? \\nThere is nothing to be emotionally or spiritually invested in in TLJ. No justification for empathy when we get little if any from the characters.  \\nI could watch the original trilogy over and over\\, now with my own kids\\, but I cannot bear a second viewing of TLJ. Its just too frustrating and heartbreaking. \\nThe purity\\, grace\\, fortitude and rare enduring optimism of Luke Skywalker has been assassinated. \\nThe writer\/director\/producers disrespected and  dismissed Luke in such a feeble ignominious way \\nthat it's hard not to resent them. After all the pomp and hype\\, they failed a multigenerational fandom. FAILED the legacy.  \\n\\nThe single star is for the commendable performances--especially from Hamill\\, Driver and Ridley. In fact\\, it's a miracle Mark Hamill didn't just walk away from this debacle. He gets 5 stars...for having the tenacity\\, pluck\\, stamina and positivity \\nof the real Luke!","true":true}
