Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had read some of the negative reviews from the public. They seemed to go against the grain of the critics and it was surprising. After it started I thought I was not going to like it as much as I hoped. That quickly changed and the film just got better and better. Don\u2019t believe the nay sayers. This is an epic ride and a welcome addition to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
