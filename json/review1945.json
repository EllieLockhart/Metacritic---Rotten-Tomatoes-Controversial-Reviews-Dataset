Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As many say hard to review without giving spoilers.. so if you haven't seen don't read.\\n\\nHave never been more disappointing in a star wars movie.   Once again rather than telling a new story we have in many ways been given a poor man's version of Empire Strikes back.   We have a young 'Jedi' seeking training from an old master.. we have the rebels on the run after a defeat and we have a quest to seek help from a 'friend of a friend' who will betrays them to the empire.\\n\\nThe main story plot is lazy\\, makes little sense and relies on cheap tricks to force major plot points. \\n\\nThe imperials cannot catch the fleeing rebels and must wait until they run out of fuel forcing our heroes to make many noble sacrifices... well except for\\na) The 1000's of star fighters on the imperial ships could catch up at any time\\nb) Anyone who jumps to Hyperspace can (as shown in the movie when they arrive with the hacker) so why not just send a star destroyer or two to jump ahead.\\nc) Why would only one ship track.. modern navies don't go around saying well folks we have 20 ships in our fleet equipped with radar but let's only use the one.   \t\\n\\nThe trip to the casino seems largely pointless and has some of the worst CGI in the movie.  In many ways it seems to have been added to force (what I admit was the coolest scene of the movie) another hero to make a sacrifice with the hyperspace kamikaze.  Which of course has you asking\\nA)\tHyperspace Kamikaze attacks are a thing ?  I kinda thing the rebels might have tried using the tactic before then.\\nB)\tSo the original plan was not to clock the transports ?  or is this new cloaking trick known to everyone but the first order (allowing our heroes to be betrayed)\\n\\nI could go on.. but in short almost every major plot development relies on new tricks that even in the star wars universe seem far-fetched and out of place  (Hyperspace Tracking\\, Leia's superman act\\, Luke life ending astral projection\\, BOMBS IN SPACE) almost a first for any of the star wars movies.            \\n\\nIt also seems like Disney has decided it must compete with Game of Thrones\\,  I guess they must be looking towards those toys sales .. the number of named characters killed off is significant as is the attempt to kill off all the original cast (poor Ackabar..should have just retired.\\n\\nUltimately for me the biggest betrayal as an old school fan is what they have done to our heroes\\, our universe\\, our stories.  Star Wars\\, a classic tale of good triumphs over evil\\, where our heroes (and their descendants live happily ever after) continuing to fight the good fight (aka expanded universe) a universe with infinite possible of future adventures and escapism  .. nope we have a corrupt universe in which most people would have been better off if the rebels never one a failed marriage\\, a failed and disgraced  politician and a fallen grumpy Jedi who can take on the emperor\\, but after failing with his Jedi academy\\, gives up a lets his nephew be the next Darth Vader.  We have no happy ending\\, no sense of our heroes fight being just\\, we brought our heroes back so we could show them as flawed\\, failed individuals before killing them and the dream off.","true":true}
