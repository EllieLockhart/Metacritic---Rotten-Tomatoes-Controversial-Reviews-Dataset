Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is AWFUL!! I'm a huge die hard Star Wars fan ever since I was a kid and I wanted to walk out of the theatre.  I'm all for new characters and new plot lines but this was done in bad taste.  Unnecessary jokes\\, bad acting\\, and completely unnecessary scenes.  Disney has a lot to clean up here and I don't plan on ever going back to the theatre to see new Star Wars movies.  They've ruined it for me.","true":true}
