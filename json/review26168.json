Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not saying that Star wars is known for explaining the science and whys behind a lot of things\\, but this installment adds so many questions to how common sense worked a long ago and far far away. The Resistance thinks and makes decisions like teenagers in a bad horror film\\, and First Order generals go from being reprimanded for failure to being praised over for apparently inventing new technology on the spot over the course of 5 minutes. \\nAfter this one my only hope for the next film is that at least one writer for the next film will visit a Star Wars wiki page.","true":true}
