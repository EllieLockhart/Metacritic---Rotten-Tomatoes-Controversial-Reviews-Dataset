Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, I see interesting ideas here but it is muddled in a cliched\\, scattered and non-sensical plot. This movies is ultimately about characters choosing a side but this is just an instance of snake eating it's own tail\\, they already had a side you messed it up in the beginning and came full circle back. Most people confuse that this movie is about \\\"killing the past\\\" no it's not! it's about correcting your past but also respecting it. The thing is Rian Johnson we don't need a whole damn movie for that. I see the themes of militarism and corporate interest of weapons besides disasters from Poe Damarin and Kantobite subplots. All in all I think the film is ambitious but also incredibly dumb. It's not a hot garbage but an interesting mess.\\n\\nNote to blockbuster filmmakers: Please stop with the inter-cuts it doesn't add tension it is annoying.","true":true}
