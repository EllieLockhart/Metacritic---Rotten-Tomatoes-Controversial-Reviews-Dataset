Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely brilliant. Thrilling\\, funny\\, emotional\\, unpredictable. Visually rich. Thematically rich. With other recent Star Wars films\\, I've had to ask the question whether I liked it more or less than A New Hope or Return of the Jedi. This is the first time I've needed to ask myself whether I liked it better than Empire Strikes Back!","true":true}
