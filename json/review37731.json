Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was much anticipation with this movie\\, and the director certainly delivered a lot of nostalgia throughout the movie. I enjoyed the movie\\, however. At times\\, the movie felt incoherent\\, and the screenwriter was reluctant to optimize the full potential of Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and Adam Driver. With the allotted time of 152 minutes\\, I hoped for better continuity with character development. Overall\\, this movie captured the essence of the Star Wars franchise!","true":true}
