Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lol. People don\u2019t know what they want with Star Wars. This was a great movie and a wonderful addition to the franchise. There\u2019s still another part of the trilogy\\, all these unanswered questions will be resolved\\, and if not\\, then by the canon expanded universe. Don\u2019t be fooled by the haters who can\u2019t let go of the past. Star Wars needed a fresh direction and now it\u2019s has one. ","true":true}
