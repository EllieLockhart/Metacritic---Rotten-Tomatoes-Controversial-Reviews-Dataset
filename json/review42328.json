Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, though better than Star Wars the Force Awakens\\, continues the disturbing trend of identity politics in these blockbuster movies nowadays.   I found the use of unlikely heroes who would probably not be able to accomplish the feats of heroism attributed to them in this movie to be disconcerting at best and fraudulent at worst.  When will they get back to a more authentic depiction consistent with the original casting?","true":true}
