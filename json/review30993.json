Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So focused on being politically correct and adding extra plot lines to include unecessary characters that it loses focus on decades of Star Wars lore built before it. In the end the movie drags on for hours and nothing really happens except the crucifixion of your childhood.","true":true}
