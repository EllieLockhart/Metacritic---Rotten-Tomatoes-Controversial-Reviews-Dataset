Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks for slowly killing off everything I love about Star Wars for two and a half hours.  I mean did you even read any of the Sat Wars books or comic books?  This is the best plot Disney could come up with?  Way to move the story forward or whatever you call this. I will never buy a Star Wars movie ticket again.","true":true}
