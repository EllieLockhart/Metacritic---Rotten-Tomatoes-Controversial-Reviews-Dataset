Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a second viewing\\, many moments that came off as nonsensical\\, or as shocking just for the sake of shock value\\, I now see as well thought out and brilliant direction meant to inject new life into a franchise that desperately needed to go in a new direction. And I am happy to say I am thrilled to see how it all culminates in the final act. THAT Leia moment and the several Deus Ex Machinas towards the film's finale hold it back from being on the same level as The Empire Strikes Back. 4 out of 5 stars.","true":true}
