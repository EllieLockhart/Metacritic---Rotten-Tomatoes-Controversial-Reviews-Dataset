Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent cinematography\\, impressive soundtrack and a beautiful color schematic. This definitely takes the number two spot for me out of all the star wars movies. Some parts felt a little slow but it picked up its pace when it fell down\\, overall an amazing film.","true":true}
