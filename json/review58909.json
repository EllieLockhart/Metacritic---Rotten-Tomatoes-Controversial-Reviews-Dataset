This game blew me away\\, I agree that the story went in such a way that I disliked it at first glance. But if you play on\\, you come to realise why it happened and why it actually had to happen! By the end of the story\\, everything about the game made sense and was a real blast to play through. I took my time to explore and find all the lore and finished it in around 24 hours. There aren\u2019t many single player games with that length\\, there aren\u2019t many games that actually made me feel the way I did when playing. The whole premise had an atmosphere that is extremely immersive and the fluidity of the games progression is spot on. I can\u2019t fault it\\, if I\u2019m honest. You get multiple sides of the story and when it all actually comes together\\, it\u2019s a wild and brutal ride that will leave a mark! If you enjoyed the first\\, you will no doubt enjoy this one. I was very anti-TLOU2 after I saw the leaks a few months back and I already knew the general jist of the story. But I didn\u2019t let that spoil the game\\, the leaks happen within the 2 hour mark and the rest of the 22 hours it took for me to finish came as a surprise. The lore in this game is incredible\\, there are many different stories going on that you physically read through. I literally have nothing bad to say about this game. Apart from the fact people are leaving bad reviews for no reason when you can clearly see they never played it!Favourite chapter: Seattle Day 2 - Ground Zero. This chapter was absolutely incredible. If you enjoyed the first one\\, buy this game and don\u2019t listen to all the negativity! You will not be disappointed! The last 3 hours of the game will blow you away!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
