Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a person that is open minded on just about everything in the gaming and reality...this game gave no justice to the previous. Naughty dog just **** over Joel\\, the same person that never trusted anyone \\, to the point that he had to run over some guy due to his experience that one no one can be trusted. The same guy that was a smuggler and did unspeakable thing for 20 years since the pandemic. To killing him off in just 30 minutes and then want to encourage sympathy on the person that murdered him for 10 hours that is messed up... the entire game was misleading\\, just like the false advertisements on the trailers.  In the end we didn\u2019t get revenge  **** ass Abby. Naughty Dog had one job and they **** it over and left us high and dry. I was a fan of the first part\\, just like manny spat on Joel\\, Naughty Dog spat on us. Don\u2019t even buy the game\\, you will just be disappointed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
