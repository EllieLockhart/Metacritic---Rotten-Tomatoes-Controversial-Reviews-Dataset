Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was boring with the long chase in space\\, and fin and rose resucing animals for 30 mins was just stupid\\, and a commander taking over with pink hair\\, and actting so femine\\, is not how a commander should be. Worst star wars movie ever! Who ever thinks that the prequels are worse then eisode 8\\, you are lying to yourself and you are just plain dumb.","true":true}
