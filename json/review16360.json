Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm over the moon about the subtext--the (multiple) messages connected so well with the events that each character set into motion\\, and I can't wait to see the direction they take now that so much has changed.  I could hardly control my limbs while watching it on the premier night\\, and as I left the theater I felt warm and alive.  As an aside\\, I'm also incredibly grateful that the tradition of introducing exotic alien creatures was preserved.","true":true}
