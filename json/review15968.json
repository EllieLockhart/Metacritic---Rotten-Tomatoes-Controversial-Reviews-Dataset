Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to post this review:\\n\\nThis movie\\, takes EVERYTHING that Star Wars is about\\, and just smears it over with Taun Taun shit. I cried. Not\\, because the film was so good\\, but because it was TERRIBLE. It's officially over guys\\, Star Wars is ruined. While I watched it I felt as if my childhood was being raped by Mickey fucking Mouse.","true":true}
