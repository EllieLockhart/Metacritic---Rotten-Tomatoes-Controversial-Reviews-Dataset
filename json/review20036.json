Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was interesting\\, it was different\\, and it held that little bit of Star Wars magic.\\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\\n\\n  As to those who are mad about not knowing Snokes origin\\, I don't think it matters so much who he was and his story\\, but how he influenced the stories of our main characters.","true":true}
