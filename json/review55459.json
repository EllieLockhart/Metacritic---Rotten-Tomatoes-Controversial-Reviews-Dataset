Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mixed feelings about this one. Some of the coolest visuals in Star Wars\\, the Praetorian guard fight was great\\, visions between Rey and Kylo Ren was cool\\, Yoda's appearance was awesome! However\\, the constant joking made it feel like a marvel movie\\, not Star Wars\\, no character said \\\"I've got a bad feeling about this\\\" Luke was written as a quitter and the exact opposite of what fans wanted\\, not to mention the bad Leia \\\"Mary Poppins\\\" scene. Hopefully episode 9 will right these flaws and give a spectacular end to the Skywalker saga.","true":true}
