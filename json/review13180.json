Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't see how anyone could be disappointed\\, there's always room for improvement but it's good one for sure! Good story and good character development and just the right amount of action. Highly recommended\\, I'll be seeing it again!","true":true}
