Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its hard to admit it\\, but it was terrible movie. Its ironic that Disney managed to bribe most of the critics (or critics just want to be more popular with youth... poor moustache petes) but didnt managed to make a decent movie. Plot doesnt have holes\\, whole plot is a giant hole. Its sad to see all these characters who had such promising start in force wakens just got so wasted. Its a movie tht imbraces what is worst in our postmodernist culture\\, its ode to mediocricy. If John Galt would start rebelion now it should be against companies like disney. \\nStill there were few moments of joy in this movie\\, but dont be decieved. Legacy of originals\\, even legacy of force awakens were just wipd out with single hand. Greedy mouse shot perfectly healthy horse and started beating it and it wont stop untill there will be any profit.....","true":true}
