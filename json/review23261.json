Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. I will go and see this again and again if I can.  The problem with reviews is that everyone on the internet has an opinion\\, and worse\\, they think you need or care to hear it.\\n\\nWe grew up on Star Wars. We have stayed fans through out our lives. We loved this installment and can't wait for the next. I left immediately wanting to see it again\\, and I did not feel cheated or let down by the story. We experienced that hint of magic we did as children\\, it showed us something new. The 'Something New' - did not leave us angry and spouting for days to anyone who would listen. \\n\\nIt was worth our ticket price\\, it will be in our personal collection when it gets released. It will be played and replayed\\, just like the original trilogy.","true":true}
