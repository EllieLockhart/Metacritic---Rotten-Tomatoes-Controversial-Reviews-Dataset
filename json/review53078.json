Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie that gets better the more you think about it. I realize that many come to a Star Wars movie wanting non-stop action scenes\\, predictable 1-dimensional characters\\, and simple answers to \\\"mysteries\\\" set up in the previous movie. SPOILERS:\\n\\n And it is true that those simple answers (who is Snoke? who are Rey's parents?) are either not forthcoming or less than dramatic. BUT - these are\\, in fact\\, all carefully chosen to support the main theme of this movie which is that the Force\\, and power in general\\, is not hereditary\\, not for a select elite\\, but something that can arise from anywhere. Luke has realized this through his long life and realized that the Jedi were just another manifestation of this elitist mentality that\\, while not as directly evil as the dark side\\, eventually leads to the same place. That is why he has hidden himself and rejected the Jedi orthodoxy. For those who lament the loss of action-figure Luke - this is in fact a very heroic journey that Luke has taken!  \\n\\nMeanwhile the Resistance (Rebels) are failing at almost every turn. Whittled down to a pathetic couple of dozen people with nobody in the galaxy willing to help and most of their leaders dead. At the end of the second act of the trilogy\\, the lowest point is reached. In the third act\\, episode IX\\, a new Resistance will arise. But it will not be by recreating the Rebel Alliance. Rey will presumably be the leader\\, but will have to forge a completely new way that finds and links the many \\\"nobodies\\\" that arise from anywhere to connect with the Force.\\n\\nThe great movies have the best villains and Kylo Ren is certainly one of the most conflicted and interesting Star Wars villain yet. \\n\\nAnd sure\\, it is schmalzy - it is Star Wars after all. But in the genre\\, one of the more thoughtful and thought-provoking entries.","true":true}
