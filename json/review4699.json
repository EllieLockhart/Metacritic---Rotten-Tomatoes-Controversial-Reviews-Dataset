Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete garbage! A review would be an utter waste of my time. I hope Rian Johnson gets hit by a cement mixer but survives long enough to feel carrion vultures feast on his flesh. As a lifelong SW fan I have absolutely no interest in seeing any SW properties that have anything to do with him.","true":true}
