{"101487":134437,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know it is a month too late\\, but here is my official review for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nYou should know that I love Star Wars. I love Star Wars the same way that car people love cars\\, or sports fans love watching sports. Star Wars to me was this grand epic Science Fiction Fantasy where the philosophies of good versus evil were debated in these fantastic battles featuring fantastic characters. Star Wars almost always delivered nuanced fun stories that would swallow my imagination and still leaving me wanting more.\\n\\nTo be honest Disney's time as master of the Star Wars franchise has been to me a very mixed bag with bad moments and good ones too.\\n\\nWhile I found Force Awakens to be a boring and lazy repeat of Star Wars: The Last Hope\\, I found great enjoyment watching Rogue One. That movie introduced great new characters\\, solid stories and introspection about the nature of sacrifice\\, and fit perfectly into the canon.\\n\\nSo what do I think of the newest Star Wars adventure?\\n\\nFun to watch\\, but not great overall. And definitely the worst the Star Wars product Disney has put out so far.\\n\\nThe biggest problems with the movie can be divided into 2 categories: movie filler and character mismanagement.\\n\\nThe first major problems with the Last Jedi are pretty much universally agreed upon and there are few defenders.Trying to sit and watch this film makes the problem very clear. Seriously\\, there is at least 1 hour of useless plodding that contributes almost nothing to the movie.There is a good movie somewhere in all this footage. However you will have to sit 2 and 1\/2 hours to see it.\\n\\nAnd if you think that is bad you should see how it treats the original trilogy characters. The sin of legacy character mismanagement and just poor character writing is much more bothersome to me and other long time fans.\\n\\nLuke\\, Leia\\, and even Chewbacca are poorly written and untrue to their portrayals in the original trilogy of Star Wars movies. This not only hurts the interest of fans in this movie but how people will now look at the Star Wars franchise as a whole. And Despite what the Holly-Wood writers say\\, the character portrayals aren't just fan complaints that need to be blown off. I imagine the long term financial prospects of The Last Jedi are hurt by this corporate decision making.\\n\\nLuke is a weakly sarcastic humdrum Ebeneezer type character that is almost 180 degrees of difference in philosophy and morality. His backstory plot and his decision making for most of the film is very un-Luke Skywalker like. Yes there is a cool moment at the end of the film\\, but even here The Last Jedi disappoints. The one time that we actually get to see Luke get off his couch\\, take a shower\\, and actually help turns out to be a nothing but a mirage.\\n\\nSpoilers\\,he literally turns out to be a mirage.\\n\\nThere are powerful moments for Mark Hamill to strut his acing ability\\, and there this film doesn't disappoint.Hamill has for decades proven himself one of them most capable actors in venues like dubbing animation\\, and audio plays. It is nice to see he gets a chance to shine.\\n\\nHowever\\, we don't get the same opportunity to watch the usually funny and powerful late actress Carrie Fisher. Here Leia is indecisive\\, quiet and plays little into the decision making of the resistance when she does manage to speak. It is obvious that the footage they did get of the late awesome actress was much less than the PR Disney wanted us to believe. And this movie is all the poorer for it.\\n\\nTo make up for this\\, a new actress is cast to play the lines Fisher couldn't and it doesn't help much. The Purple Haired general is probably the most forgettable character for the amount of screen time given in this movie. A weak sub-plot involving her and the character Poe is not only boring\\, but nonsensical and riddled with plot holes. Even the great sacrifice this character makes is hard to watch and does little to redeem her.\\n\\nYet despite all these problems\\, I still recommend you watch this film. The Jedi parts with Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren are fascinating and bespeak of a much better movie. If this relationship had been used as the sole focus of the movie instead of adding so much filler I'd be happy to give this movie at least a 7 even if Skywalker is now a curmudgeonly grouch who likes to murder children in their sleep.\\n\\nI hope dear reader you noticed that I haven't yet nodded to the extremely strange and disbelief killing parts of this movie. In particular\\,the scene where we actually get to see Leia use the force turns out to be this weirdly whimsical resurrection in the style of Marry Poppins. Plus the time Luke milks an alien walrus\\, or Yoda helps Luke in a book burning. The last of which bothers me more than probably anything else.\\n\\nNo way in ewok hell would Yoda ever try to destroy the legacy of the Jedi nor authorize book burning of any kind. But this is exactly the thematic message that Star Wars know wants us to understand.\\n\\nTo quote Kylo Ren: \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to\\\". Isn't that the same message that fascistic nations and dictators want their citizens believe. If Hitler was in the theater I could imagine him giving a thumbs up.\\n\\nI doubt I'll be able to sit-down and happily watch this film again in the same way I do for all of the other films. This movie really has damaged my love for the Star Wars franchise. The prequels which I overall enjoyed and often made fun of; never spat upon the legacy and beloved characters of the original trilogy. Jar Jar never took away from the dynamic story and character that is Luke Skywalker. This movie does\\, and does it with pride.\\n\\nYet I still recommend most people to go see Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It is a visually stunning film\\, and the Rey\/Kylo Ren storyline is entertaining and thought provoking; even if it concludes with the wrong sentiment. Just be prepared to wait 2 1\/2 hours to see it\\, and know coming in that you will hate what they do to the old Star Wars crew.\\n\\nIf you can stomach all that the let the Force be with you. (as if I could of ended with anything else ;0)","true":true}
