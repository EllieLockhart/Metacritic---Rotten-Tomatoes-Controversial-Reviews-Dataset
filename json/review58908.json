Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game sits somewhere between a 7 and an 8 for me. It's no where near the masterpiece that was the first game\\, however it brings to the realities of living in a post apocalyptic world.Most people hate the story\\, and understandably it takes away one of our favourite characters\\, that we've come to love over and over again with the first game. Using a character we have no knowledge or love for to kill Joel is upsetting to say the least. The game then forces you to walk a few miles in Abby's shoes\\, to make you feel a sort of empathy for her. Whilst I continued to dislike Abby throughout the game we saw her  begin to change. Where she had been lost before\\, her only purpose to seek revenge\\, now she wants to do some good.  The character building was slightly weak\\, she had a very back and white attitude within the first few hours of gameplay and seemed to take great pleasure in killing\\, which is the complete opposite to Ellie.Abby is somewhat a reflection of Joel. When we first met Joel he was selfish and only did something if something was in it for him. We see Joel develop over time as he is made to take Ellie on this journey. I see a lot of this in Abby when she meets Lev. Her goals and perspective changethroughout the game\\, and her journey becomes about hope of a new beginning.There are weaknesses in the story. I for one did not like the idea of trying to kill Ellie as Abby. Why the developer thought this was a good isea\\, I don't know. I still disliked Abby at this point and it was my least favourite part of the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
