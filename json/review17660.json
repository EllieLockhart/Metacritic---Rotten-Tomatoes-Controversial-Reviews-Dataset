Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I suspect JJ and Rian didn't really discuss the plot properly. We still don't know much about Snoke and the Canto Bight sequence didn't need to be in the film. Rey is so OP that it's boring seeing her triumph given that she didn't spend much time gaining her powers. I feel bad for Kylo\\, he lost to someone who shouldn't be able to do what he can given the disparity in the years they spent training.","true":true}
