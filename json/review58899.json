My brother asked me why did I pre-order the game\\, a lot of people said it sucks\\, I was skeptical and my response was \\\"You don't know until you play\\\". When I play the game\\, I am not immersed in a story like the first game\\, I have mixed emotion\\, and different outcomes\\, I have zero emotion after the ending. On the other hand\\, I love gameplay mechanics\\, attention to detail\\, and visualization. I used to replay the original TLOU on ps3 for at least 10 times because of its game mechanic and feature. It is the most realistic game I have ever played. I am still replaying the TLOU2. I believe ND's intention is on the right path to promote diversity\\, gender equality\\, and social awareness. When ND heavily focuses on a political view\\, it interrupts the story of nature. Therefore\\, the players are experiencing a different outcome and perspective\\, and lack of satisfaction.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
