Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie without expectations. I was excited to see it and I wanted to like it\\, plain and simple.\\n\\nI wouldn't mind if the movie did something \\\"new\\\" (it doesn't). The problem is\\, this is just not a good movie. The writing is bad and the directing is poor. The visuals are mostly good but much of the CGI looks terrible. The animals on the \\\"casino planet\\\"\\, for example look awful. Most of that sequence of the film looked fake and cartoonish.\\n\\nAnother big problem is the movie is simply too long. The whole casino subplot was boring\\, badly done and a waste of time.","true":true}
