My favorite aspect of this game is the sound and cinematography. When you're walking down a snowy path\\, hearing footsteps in the snow\\, wind\\, trees\\, animals\\, and the camera changes to a view where someone on the hillside is watching your movements\\, and reacting by hiding\\, and heavily breathing\\, it really is an 80's horror film. Plenty of homage is paid to some classics as well. It's a \\\"choose your own adventure\\\" cinematic masterpiece. Some people may be upset that it isn't a \\\"game\\\" per se\\, but there's plenty of mechanics and exploration that are not QTE related. Really the fun lies in deciding who you want your characters to be\\, and playing them out as such.\r\rAs I mentioned the sound earlier\\, that's where the real jump scares come from\\, and there's plenty. I really enjoyed the twists and scares\\, and if you have an open mind\\, you will too.\r\rI give it a 9 instead of a 10 because the movement can be slow sometimes (but not like Rapture)\\, and you couldn't always make decisions that you feel your character would. There's usually only 2 choices\\, and some events could really benefit from more.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
