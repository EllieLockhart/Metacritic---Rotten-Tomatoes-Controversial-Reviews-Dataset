Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly had a lot of potential\\, but fell short. Acting and visual were great but thats about it. plot felt forced\\, jokes were lame and reliant on cheap gags\\, no good action scenes and generally very over hyped. pretty disappointing considering how the force awakens set it up so well. Rian Johnson definitely dropped the ball on this one.","true":true}
