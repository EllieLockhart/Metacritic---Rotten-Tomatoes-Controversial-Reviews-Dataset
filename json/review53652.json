Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For any die hard fans of the Star Wars franchise\\, do NOT see this movie for you will only be dissapointed. At best\\, this is a movie that was 45 minutes too long\\, and while it did have some good special effects ultimately felt unsatisfying. At its worst\\, this was a poorly written and sloppy attempt by Disney to cash in on fans of a very beloved franchise. \\n\\nThe entire ark with Finn was just completely unnecessary and did not affect the plot of the movie at all (his character probably should've been kept in a coma). Many questions fans had about characters such as Snoke and Rey's parents went unanswered or were completely written off. Worst of all\\, this film was a horrible send out for Carrie Fisher (bless her soul) and did not do her character justice.\\n\\nBy far the worst ever entry into the Star Wars universe\\, and a major let down for fans of the franchise.","true":true}
