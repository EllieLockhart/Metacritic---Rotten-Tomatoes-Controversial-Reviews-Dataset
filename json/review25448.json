Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No plot.  No answers.  Disney needs to quit trying to turn Star Wars into a Marvel movie.  Lots of stupid humor.  More holes in the storyline.  This movie was a complete waste of my time.  Episode I was better than this one.","true":true}
