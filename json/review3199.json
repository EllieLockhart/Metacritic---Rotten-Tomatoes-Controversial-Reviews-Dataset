Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful looking but empty & full of cheap tricks\\, like someone you find incredibly sexy looking until they open their mouth and their brains vomit a vapid lack of intelligence or personality aside from a few regurgitated one-liners they happened to remember. Such pathetic one-note emo villain lacking any intimidation\\, dependent on his pouty petulant resting bitch face...So many lost opportunities and uninspired storytelling\\, such a mind-numbing disappointment from Rian Johnson who held so much promise.","true":true}
