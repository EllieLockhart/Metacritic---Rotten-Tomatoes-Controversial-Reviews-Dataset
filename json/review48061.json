Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While stepping all over the lore\/characters that made the franchise what It is a sloppily penned path is chosen In the Last Jedi. One where the age old saying 'you can be anything you want when you grow up kid\\\" is echoed throughout each silly\\, over the top scene. The Cinematography and action sequences are great but the writing is poorly thought out\\, that which makes for a great story. Instead of stomping out the old story line ungracefully\\, a well written one where both the old saga\/characters and new ones both receieve the respect they deserve could have been chose. Would'a\\, should'a\\, could'a though young padiwans of modern mtv soap opera cinema.","true":true}
