Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie lacked. If you're expecting good character development and sub plots that actually go somewhere\\, then this movie isn't for you. Does not libe up to the hype. Does not deliver a good farewell to on of the most beloved characters in movie history. Not even sure what the point of so much random useless characters thrown in is about (looking at you Phasma\\, Snoke\\, Rose).","true":true}
