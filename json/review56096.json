Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much of this movie goes against what Star Wars is. Admiral Holdo should've been Admiral Ackbar and her whole \\\"I won't tell you the plan because uhhhhh...\\\" deal simply did not make sense. I was a stagnant and frankly boring set of scenes that had so many holes in the plot. You have a ship half the size of the Death Star and you only send 3 Tie Fighters at these frigates who have no fuel...c'mon. The writing for Luke absolutely goes against all that he stood for and honestly it renders the Original Trilogy pointless. Don't even get me started on Rose...she's a fun character but the Canto Bight lines are about as good as Anakin Skywalker talking about how much he hates sand. All in all\\, not a good watch and not a good movie. Rian Johnson does not understand the lore of Star Wars and is simply helping Disney push a commercial driven agenda.","true":true}
