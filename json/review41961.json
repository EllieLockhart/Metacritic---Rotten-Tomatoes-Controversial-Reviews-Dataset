Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed Star Wars for me and I have been a huge fan for a very long time. The way they changed Luke's character for the sake of the plot\\n is just unacceptable. They could have come up with a better way for Luke to go out and not have changed his character. This Star Wars movie was just disappointing and to me this is the death of Star Wars unless JJ Abrams can revive it\\, otherwise Star Wars is dead to me and it just hurts writing this because I'm not one to post reviews about movies but I just had to let my feelings be felt because I care soo much for Star Wars. All I have left is hope that the next movie won't be this bad","true":true}
