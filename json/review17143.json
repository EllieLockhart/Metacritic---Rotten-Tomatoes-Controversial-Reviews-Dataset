Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really have no idea where all the hate is coming from. The movie was fantastic! It felt like Star Wars and gave me flash backs to watching the original trilogy when I was a kid. I think people can\u2019t handle the fact that this movie made them think\\, and that it wasn\u2019t two and half hours of pure CGI battle scenes. I guess the average American just doesn\u2019t have the attention span to appreciate a work of art anymore.","true":true}
