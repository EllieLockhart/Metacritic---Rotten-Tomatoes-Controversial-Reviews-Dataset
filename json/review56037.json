Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I say this as a hardcore lifelong Star Wars fan who even loved episodes 1-3 in spite of JarJar Binks and the bad acting . . . STAR WARS The Last Jedi was abominable. An immense and stunning disappointment. A very sad day for Star Wars. Without revealing any storyline or plot details (if for no other reason than that the storyline and plot were simply awful\\, convoluted\\, and at times downright bizarre)\\, it was as if the writers\\, producers\\, and editors actually tried hard to write poorly\\, produce badly\\, and edit terribly. It was especially terrible considering the excellence of the series movie before it\\, The Force Awakens (Episode VII). As a sequel to Episode VII\\, this movie was a complete mockery. Also\\, The Last Jedi was one huge missed opportunity to expound upon the mysteries left from Episode VII that whet the appetites of fans for two years. The \\\"comedy\\\" was really bad\\, and overdone to the point of absurdity. And worst of all\\, it was void of substantive character development. Overall\\, a horrible movie\\, which is painful for me to say as a fan who absolutely loves Star Wars.","true":true}
