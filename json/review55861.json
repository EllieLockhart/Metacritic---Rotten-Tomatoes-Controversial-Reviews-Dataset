Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Questionally whether this was a cash grab for Disney\\, the film while providing some good moments\\, thrills and action scenes\\, The Last Jedi feels like a nostalgic copy and paste of the original trilogy's the empire strikes back.\\nIt also introduces new characters but they feel underdeveloped and seem to not tie with the original cast\\, and every conflict feels like it's been forced to bring to the similar conclusion of the story. \\nIt's too much of the same thing\\, just modernised","true":true}
