Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, after 2 years of very good Star Wars Movies\\, this film is one of the worst Star Wars movies.\\nThe movie starts of great but falls of quickly.\\nReys Jedi Training arc is extremely boring. The Fin arc is like watching the prequells again and it should have been cut out of the movie. Nothing good comes of that storyline.\\nThere are some high points during the movie. Reys and Kylos interactions are not bad\\, but are also screaming wasted potential. \\nAll in all not a great movie\\, full of plot holes and wasted oportunities.","true":true}
