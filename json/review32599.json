Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last Jedi is a great movie but can be slow at times.This movie is not for everyone\\,including people who don't know a lot about Star Wars. There is not a lot in action in this movie\\,but more dialogue. I give this money a A","true":true}
