Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was Hollywood's revenge on George Lucas.  It's a bad incomprehensible story that makes no sense.  It wipes away all of the pay off of the original movies.  It's a pretty film but it reduces Star Wars to the level of the 5th Element.  I will never watch a Rian Johnson film again.","true":true}
