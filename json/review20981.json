{"101487":146677,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was introduced to Star Wars as a kid like my father before me\\, and like him\\, I fell in love with a whole new universe. A tale completed by our favorite twins\\, a swashbuckling smuggler\\, his furry copilot\\, and the cool\\, masked villain; I think we all assumed that the new trilogy would embody tradition while bringing something new to the table. Originally\\, I was not impressed with The Force Awakens\\, but after a few watches and careful breakdown\\, I grew to love the complex 'baddie'\\, the new force user\\, the confused stormtrooper\\, the cocky pilot\\, and quirky droid.\\n\\nI have never seen a premiere of Star Wars movie before\\, so I earnestly began planning to see the first showing of The Last Jedi; after all the trailers looked great\\, right...? My dad and youngest sister in tow\\, we went in with high expectations and I left crestfallen. This was not part of the Star Wars universe I had fallen in love with! \\n\\nWarning: Spoilers ahead. If you have not yet watched The Last Jedi\\, you've been forewarned.\\n\\n\\\"Forget about the past. Kill it\\, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you're meant to be.\\\" The implications of this quote are now huge as it is clear this is what Rian was going to be doing with the movie\\, sadly. The Last Jedi tries so hard to be unlike any Star Wars movie we've ever seen\\, that it turns into every action movie we've ever seen\\, with a cheesy\\, Disney side-dish thrown in.\\n\\nThe writing of The Last Jedi did not take into consideration any of the subplots of The Force Awakens\\, nor does it understand the state of the galaxy after TFA.\\n\\nThe whole Rose and Finn adventure could have been cut out entirely and the movie would have made sense; still would have been a weak story with the longest 'fastest' ship chase in the history of the galaxy. In TFA\\, Finn is confused\\, but a badass. In TLJ\\, Finn is still confused\\, but now he likes destroying small towns in his spare time.\\n\\nThe humor in the TFA was subtle\\, happening at appropriate moments; a beautiful contrast and welcomed comic relief to the darker parts of the movie. Whereas\\, TLJ went out of its way to throw in the most unnecessary humor\\, typically in parts when the movie was attempting to be serious. I winced for sure\\, but I don't remember laughing much.\\n\\nForget what you knew about Luke Skywalker\\, because apparently\\, he doesn't exist anymore. In all honesty\\, I don't think spending so many years on a planet is going to change you from a wise\\, somewhat reckless Jedi\\, to a senile\\, embittered man so quickly. The man that went out of his way to go back for his father\\, the second most evil man in the galaxy (mind you)\\, now wants to murder his nephew because he saw a bit of darkness in him. By the way\\, what was the point of the map if he just wanted to die? Also\\, the writers for TLJ did not handle Luke's parting in the way that he deserved; it's almost like going the coward's way out\\, which is not like Luke at all!\\n\\nThe untimely and tragic passing of Carrie Fisher obviously left some problems for TLJ. So\\, when Leia was first sucked out into space\\, it was really sad\\, I remember gasping\\, covering my mouth in shock seeing that she was gone so quick (especially knowing the actress is really gone). If it was meant to be an emotion heartstring\\, they played it right\\, if only they had kept it that way; her death would have held more gravity. Originally\\, my first thought was that this is how war goes and it seemed realistic. So\\, oddly enough\\, I was at peace... And then Mary Poppins showed up. I thought such an iconic actress deserved better scenes... yikes...\\n\\nThere are moments where the CGI and the scenes are stunning. But\\, it's just that\\, moments. And those moments can only overshadow so much of a bad plot. The Rebellion ship through Snoke's ship\\, now that's what we're talking about! Kylo and Rey's lightsaber duel\\, such beautiful choreography! Kylo and Rey's force connection is super cool\\, unlike anything we've ever seen in the Star Wars world and it is handled nicely (except for the towel joke). But other than that\\, I can't think of much.\\n\\nRey's parentage is explored to the extent that we no longer care about her should something happen to Kylo Ren; as their connection is quite possibly the only thing holding this story together. It's interesting that Rey came from a no-name family\\, but it was hard to be happy knowing they had absolutely no connection to the Force. Rey's Mary-Sue identity is directly impacted by Johnson's choice of parentage. If she had been the descent of some sort of powerful Force user\\, then the amount of sheer luck she had could have been explained away with that\\, but alas\\, we are disappointed once again.\\n\\nI think a majority of people who genuinely wanted to give Rey a chance in TFA\\, saw her just learning to harness her force abilities\\, herself even surprised by some of the outcomes and the question of her heritage another way to explain away any plotholes. But after TLJ\\, I could not longer deny the frustration I have for her insane amount of luck. Kylo Ren\\, a villain who slaughtered the new generation of force users (like Rey) easily\\, is defeated by her twice! With two lessons of training! (She could barely hold a lightsaber in TFA [although Kylo was injured] In TLJ she wasn't even trained by Luke and suddenly she's proficient with a lightsaber). Unless Kylo's smitten with her\\, I see no reason as to why he should be so weak (you're welcome Reylo fans).\\n\\nSnoke's quick appearance\\, er\\, disappearance? Disappointed? Yeah\\, I know\\, me too.\\n\\nThe boy at the end...?? You have the Force and you have the Force and you have the Force and everybody has the Force!!\\n\\nI watched TFA in theaters five times\\, but I honestly don't know if I want to watch TLJ a second time. Overall\\, for a Star Wars movie I was not impressed\\, but if you want to entertained for 2 hours and 30 minutes\\, go for it.","true":true}
