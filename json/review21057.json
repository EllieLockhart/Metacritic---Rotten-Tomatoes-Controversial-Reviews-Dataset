Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really hyped with this movie. I was looking forward to the answers about Snoke\\, Rey's parents and Luke but everything was done in a very poor way. I find really insulting how they portrayed Luke. And all the casino sequence feels really unnesesary. Disney\\, you have done it again.","true":true}
