Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were amazing but Disney has made some terrible decisions in the story. They are planning a million films but they won't be able to continue if they don't do Star Wars right. They are trusting the wrong directors and writers with what was once an amazing franchise.","true":true}
