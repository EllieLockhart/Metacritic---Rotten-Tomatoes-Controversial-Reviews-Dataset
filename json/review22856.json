Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Longtime fans will be disappointed that there is no lightsaber duel in this movie and that Rian Johnson\u2019s understanding of physics (a central plot point) is so poor\\, it makes George Lucas look like Neils degrasse Tyson. The film is missing the swashbuckling sense of adventure of previous films\\, and instead has an odd mix of millennial romantic angst\\, misplaced slapstick comedy\\, and heavy handed themes around heroes\\, leadership\\, and the past. It\u2019s unclear if this movie will go down as the worst Star Wars film (which depends largely on if J.J. can salvage what remains for IX)\\, but it is certainly the most divisive. ","true":true}
