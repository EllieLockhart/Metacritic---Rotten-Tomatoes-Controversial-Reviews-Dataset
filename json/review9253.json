Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage movie\\, full of plot holes. Ruin Johnson ruined luke. Why would luke pull a 180 after risking his life and the galaxy for the most evil man in the galaxy\\, but tries to kill a child for having dark side thoughts. Why has no one ever used light speed ramning? Because it breaks star wars but ruin johnson doesn't care\\, he just loves the lights.","true":true}
