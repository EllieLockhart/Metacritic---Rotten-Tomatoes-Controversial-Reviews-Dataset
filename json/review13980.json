Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you grew up with the original Trilogy love the Mythology of Star Wars this movie is not For you. While there were a few moments that we creative and even magical for one scene the movie was flat too long dead end story lines that went nowhere plus you really didn't care about the characters. Except Luke and Leia. One of my biggest problems is how Luke was used. First in the Force Awakens everyone waited for his grand enterance which wasn't the most exciting when it comes to timing\\n In this film again although he does have screen time and lines I expected the great Luke Skywalker to make a huge impact in the film and it just didn't happen\\n This movie would have been better being made as a non Star Wars film. It blew up and broke every single thing that we loved in The Star Wars universe and forget about  getting answers to questions you have this film side tracks it all. Episode One was a disappointment but is 10 times better than this film.","true":true}
