Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey! I just wanted to say thanks for shitting on Luke's character just so that you can make MaRey look good! Yeah\\, I'm a woman and I hate MaRay with passion and identify with Luke Skywalker more.. Shocking right? I wonder if I will still be called a manbaby? or better yet\\, a Russian bot?\\nAnyways\\, extremely great writing I must say! Not lazy at all! \\nI have one suggestion: Please make a fanfiction writer handle the project next time\\, because let me tell you\\, they will be far more passionate and imaginative\\, better than the disaster you gave us :)\\nAlso\\, please listen to Mister Mark Hamil's suggestions next time\\, he deserves some respect...\\n\\nAnyways\\, I would have loved to give this movie 1\/2 star\\, but since Rotten Tomato won't count it for Audience Score\\, I sadly had to give this two stars :(","true":true}
