Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this may be my new favorite Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson created a new\\, unique story by returning to the roots of what Science Fiction and Science Fantasy are about: Commentary. This whole movie felt like a series of related plots all showing that hubris leads to failure.","true":true}
