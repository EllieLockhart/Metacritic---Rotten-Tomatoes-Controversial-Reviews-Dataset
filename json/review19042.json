Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's fantastic. It's beyond fantastic. It has themes\\, it has heart\\, it has female characters as actual human beings! \\n\\nYou might not like it\\, that does not make it a bad movie. It's thought provoking\\, lovingly shot\\, well written and well characterized. I loved it more than almost any other film I'd ever seen\\, it's quite possibly my favorite. Don't let the past rob you of your future. Spoiler\\, a big theme of the movie.","true":true}
