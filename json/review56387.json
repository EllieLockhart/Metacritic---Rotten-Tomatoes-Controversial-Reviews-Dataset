Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly written and incoherent film. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have destroyed the legacy of Star Wars. This film felt like such a slap to the face and F you to the original and loyal fans with their dare to be different approach to the film. This film is on no level comparable to Empire by any means. We the loyal fans do not fear or hate change we are very open to it as long as it's done well and in a way to help advance the plot. Our problem is with the plot holes\\, abandoning everything set up in TFA and pretty much destroying the character we've all been waiting to see in Luke giving him such a terrible sendoff. It's no wonder Mark Hamill was so against Johnsons take on Luke. I wanted to really like the new characters but there's very little to no development for them. Will not be watching any future star wars films and spinoffs.","true":true}
