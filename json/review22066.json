Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy is quoted as saying Rian Johnson truly gets Star Wars. If anything\\, this movie PROVES he DOES NOT get Star Wars. Disney\\, if you are reading these reviews fire the entire senior management of LucasFilm and don't let Rian make another movie in this universe. None of them get Star Wars to allow this to make it off the cuttting room floor.","true":true}
