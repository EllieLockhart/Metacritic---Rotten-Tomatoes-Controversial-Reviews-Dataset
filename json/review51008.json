Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely amazing! There is significant growth in every character\\, the power of the Force is on display in new and awe inspiring ways\\, the fights and battles are jaw-dropping\\, and it highlights the internal struggle between light and dark as well as how blurred that line can become better than any other SW film to date. There were two small scenes that felt forced and out of place\\, but despite this\\, it kept me on the edge of my seat for its entire 3hr runtime.","true":true}
