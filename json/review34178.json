Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you Disney for ruining my childhood hero Luke Skywalker and portraying him totally wrong than who he really was in the original saga. By the time he finally got some action he didn't even get to wield his green lightsaber and have this awesome fight to show how strong he really was. Disney has no f*cking idea what Star Wars really was and i truly hope they will get Rian Johnson off the next trilogy or it will suck even more when he doesn't have the great characters to rely on anymore. I give it 1 star because of the scene with Yoda..and please Disney stop with the stupid jokes!","true":true}
