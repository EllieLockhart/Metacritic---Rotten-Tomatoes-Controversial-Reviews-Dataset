Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disappointment. We learned nothing new about Rey who was still a Mary Sue. The lazy explanation was that her parents were alcoholics who sold her for money. Luke did nothing but brood\\, eat fish\\, and drink alien teat milk for nearly 3 hours. Snoke was just a red herring who we learned nothing about. Phasma was a plot device. Del Toro and Dern's character's were also plot devices. Finn and Rose had a strange and unexpected romance that felt forced and unnatural. Leia used the force to resurrect herself after dying in space and then started flying like superman. This movie was bad. The writing was incredibly disappointing. Even Mark Hamill\\, who played Luke\\, disagreed with the script and hated everything that Rian Johnson did. So many fans waited since 1983 only to see Luke be depressed\\, eat fish\\, and eventually die while meditating. We never got to see him in action or see him persevere through these difficult times. His character was so out of character. Luke Skywalker would never abandon his sister\\, Leia\\, under any circumstances. Rian Johnson took terrible risks with this film. It's over-hyped and ultimately disappointing.","true":true}
