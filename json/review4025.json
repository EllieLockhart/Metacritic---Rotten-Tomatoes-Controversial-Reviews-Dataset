Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Both long and dense\\, but with a well thought pace that gives the viewer time to assimilate. Both the most intimate and spectacular chapter\\, with incredible sparks of immagination\\, and fulfilling character arcs. Everything that you want from a Star Wars is here.","true":true}
