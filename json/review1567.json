Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I was a bit underwhelmed by The Last Jedi. The combination of odd\\, out-of-place slapstick humor and \\\"cute Disney magic\\\" was nothing short of cringeworthy. On top of that\\, I found the plot to be choppy and even a bit confusing (even for someone who knows the Star Wars universe inside and out). I couldn't shake the feeling of whiplash as the the plot jerked from one direction to the next\\, and introduced new main characters with little to no development. Despite the disappointment\\, the last 40 minutes of the movie contained some unforgettable battle scenes along with emotional dialogue that really pulled on the heart strings.","true":true}
