Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with high hopes. I am a gigantic Star Wars fan\\, and I love the Force Awakens. Rey was a personal favorite\\, yet I hoped to see Poe Dameron and Fin develop as characters. Instead\\, I received a nonsense plot that stifles the growth of the new characters I love.\\n\\n-Finn and Rose's storylines make no sense. None of he characters grow. \\n\\n-Rey is now Korra from Legend if Korra.\\n\\n-The movie manages to make Poe\\, a very level headed guy\\, out to be a bad guy for not listening to a crazy lady with purple hair.\\n\\n-Luke Skywalker gets plunked.\\n\\n-weird Yoda\\n\\nNo one takes any responsibility in this movie\\, much like the corporate glutton hat spawned it. Literally a viewing experience that is more like \\\"The Room\\\"\\, without being bad enough to be good. \\n\\nI am hoping JJ Abrams can fix this mess with he next installment.","true":true}
