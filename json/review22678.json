Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many others I created an account solely to expound my thoughts on how bad this film is. I haven't been this disappointed in a film since Episode 1.\\n\\nOther than the cinematography\\, which is sublime\\, this was a total mess. Poor storytelling\\, poor character motivations\\, nonsensical and anticlimactic.","true":true}
