Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems like the second movie in this trilogy lost some of the luster the first one had. I don't want to spoil anything but characters that were set up in the last movie and in this one have no payoff\\, and interjected love feels forced. It's still enjoyable and I recommend it if you like the series but just don't go in thinking it's going to be the best of the series","true":true}
