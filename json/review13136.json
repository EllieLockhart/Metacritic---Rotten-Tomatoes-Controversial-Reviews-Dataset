Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know why but it doesn't feel right to me.... like it's not a Staw Wars film like the others are.  Even the prequels felt like they belonged in star wars even of they aren't the best movies but this just doesn't fit.  There are good scenes in it but not enough hope and adventure that it should have had","true":true}
