Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After reading JJ Abrams' comments this morning\\, that it's the fan's problems\\, not his\\, in regards to not liking the movie because there are too many women as leaders\\, I am ASSURED of NOT seeing the final movie in this latest trilogy.  To think that we are so inept at judging the quality of a movie\\, and instead think that the only reason we rate it one notch above \\\"pathetic\\\" is that we are somehow insecure with having women in positions of power some time in the future\\, far\\, far\\, away\\, just shows HOW far out of touch these Hollywood power-trippers are with the real world.  Really Abrams?  Really?  \\n\\nHere's what you need to know JJ:  It's not that \\\"we\\\" have a problem with women in power\\, it's that TLJ was an OBVIOUS stuff-it-down-your-throat Hollywood\/Disney acquiescence of this day and age.  Let's make everyone happy who is not happy\\, at the cost of everyone else who is happy and would remain happy if people would just GTFU and stop acting like a victim in everything.  \\n\\nAll that aside\\, you MUST be out of touch if you think you're just going to build off this monstrosity of a move known as \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" and somehow convince us all naysayers to hop back on board the SW Universe with THAT f'ed up attitude.  \\n\\nIt's not us\\, it's the fan's.  LOL.  Give me a break!  Well\\, actually you did.  About $100 worth in about two years\\, considering the cost of the movie plus concessions for myself and two kids.","true":true}
