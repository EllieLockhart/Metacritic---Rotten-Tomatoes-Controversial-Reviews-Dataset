Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it.  Al of my kids loved it.  So many plot twists and amazing action sequences.   I really enjoyed the cinematography.  Rian did a superb job of bringing in humor and parallel editing.  I was very impressed with his use of thematics from other sci fi films in the past that are not in the Star Wars Universe.  I think he has creaed a bold new vision of Star Wars for this nnew generation.  I was worried because Disney has a tendancey to dumb down everything it touches.  However\\, Rian managed to deliver an excellent film despite their meddling.  I loved the opening sequence and his play on the story roll.  I would like to see Ray's internal dialogue verbalized a bit more.  I like what he did\\, but hoped it would linger a bit more and add in that scene\\, which I will not spoil.  He totally nailed the mercurial nature of the Sith!","true":true}
