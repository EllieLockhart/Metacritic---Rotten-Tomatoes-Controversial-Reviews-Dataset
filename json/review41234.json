Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This \\\"movie\\\" is a 152 minutes long hate letter from Rian Johnson to the fans of the Star Wars franchise. I have never seen a movie so evidently aimed at outraging\\, mocking\\, disrespecting\\, emotionally harming the fan base. And then the director has the courage to accuse the fan base to be too stupid to understand the movie. We got it\\, dear fuckface. Your next hate letters will be welcomed by desert theaters. I hope this is the last movie you will be allowed to direct.","true":true}
