Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to start this with the fact I am a YUUUGE Star Wars fan. I've been hooked since the day I entered the theatre back in the 70s and saw the monumental first offering\\, episode IV. That said\\, after seeing this latest movie\\, The Last Jedi\\, in the theatre this week\\, I wouldn't even waste time watching in on Network TV. \\nI did enjoy the last film\\, The Force Awakens\\, and was anticipating many things from Jedi\\, but the writing\\, acting and editing were so incredibly overplayed and overrated that I could hardly bear to sit in my sit; I even went back to the concession stand and chatted with the employees there for a bit due to frustration and boredom. \\nThe plot was confused and there wasn't ample time for character development. I mean\\, as an avid SW fan who looks back fondly at The Empire Strikes Back and it's spiritual development of SKYWALKER in the scenes with Yoda\\, which were played out during a large portion of that film. In this Last Jedi movie\\, Yoda was a joke\\, flippant and used like a bad prop while Rey seemed to read \\\"Jedi for Idiots\\\" with the disjointed journey she took. There was little coherence in the story line and a definite lack of development of same.\\nThe brighter moments were when Kylo Ren and Rey shared scenes\\, although the fact that these two young whippersnappers were able to kill Snoke pretty quickly left more questions than answers and killed credibility as well; it should be remembered that it took Skywalker\\, Solo\\, Leia and the rag tag gang three entire movies to rid the universe of Vadar and Emperor Palpatine! Max Kanata is a better Yoda in this film than Yoda was and had too small of a role to play.  Poe was also present in the better moment and I was surprised to see Finnabsent from much of the film.  The ports are undeniably cute but seemed tossed in for kid appeal.\\n\\nOverall\\, the story was too rushed\\, and too busy. The storyline seemed forced and most likely deserved to be split into two or three films on its own. The writing was sophomoric and the Star Wars franchise deserves better!","true":true}
