Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fanfic gone horribly wrong\\, Star Wars: the last Jedi is a which looks like they took scenes from episodes 5 and 6 and copy\/pasted them into a horribly made film which is pulling for Kathleen kennedys out of date and out of touch SJW agenda and is essentially a propaganda piece where I watched a horrific casino scene for near 30 minutes just so the plan it revolved around could collapse and so I could get an animal rights message. This movie is so bad and so unfunny that I longed for the days of Jar Jar Binks and re-releases. I wish I hadn't spent my money on it. If you're going to go anyhow and see this train wreck\\, fine\\, but I wouldn't take your kids\\, you don't want them to think this movie is what Star Wars is meant to be.","true":true}
