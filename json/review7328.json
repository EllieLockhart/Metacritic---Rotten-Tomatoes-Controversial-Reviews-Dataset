Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 suffers from poorly written characters\\, an unhealthy obsession with subverting expectations\\, unsatisfying conclusions and answers\\, and a boring plot riddled with holes. The only real benefit is it's visuals (excluding the fight scenes\\, which are poorly thought out and choreographed). All in all\\, The Last Jedi is a missed opportunity to tell a deeper and darker story.","true":true}
