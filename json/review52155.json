Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the momentum of The Force Awakens\\, this movie was a huge disappointment.  None of the story lines that were set up in the first movie went anywhere.  Brand new characters were introduced who served no purpose.  There were no back stories provided to explain where the new order came from\\, the bad guy\\, who looked like Golum and Lord Voldemort's love child\\, was given no back story and then killed off\\, apparently only for the purpose of putting Kylo Ren in charge.  There were so many holes in the story you could drive a truck through them\\, and eventually I have up on enjoying the movie.  I will not bother seeing the next one\\, or any of the others Disney comes out with.  After a childhood of growing up loving Star Wars\\, this franchise is officially dead for me.","true":true}
