Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot doesn't flow in any logical fashion.  Rian Johnson has failed at writing a coherent story.  I hope the characters get a better opportunity to shine in the future under a different studio.  Lucasfilm should not be allowed to malke any more Star Wars films.  The writiers for KOTOR should be hired to save the franchise.","true":true}
