Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So its official\\, these New Star Wars films are not made for Star Wars fans. Disney has decided to reinvent the universe without many of those traditional hallmark Star Wars signatures; such as well choreographed lightsaber vs lightsaber duels\\, usage of a variety of force powers\\, the mythos of the orders\\, familial bloodlines\\, valuable character backstories\\, the importance of skill training and that familiar magical sense of viewing a richly established adventure. All of which have solidified the series as the paramount space opera. \\nDisney's steering committee has decided to undermine and demystify George Lucas's legacy in what I assume is an attempt to supplant it with a more accessible framework for the broadest of future audiences\\, specifically children. \\nNeedless to say\\, I was disappointed as a Star Wars fan in The Last Jedi. Sad as a sci-fi fantasy fanboy but as Mark Hamil himself said \\\"It's not important if its high quality\\, only if it makes money. And because Force Awakens made a lot of money\\, ergo its good.\\\"\\nLike The Force Awakens before it\\, The Last Jedi will surely make billions with a \\\"B\\\" dollars worldwide but will never be considered a good Star Wars installment.","true":true}
