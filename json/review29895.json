Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rotten Tomatoes are not counting 1\/2 star ratings so i gave this a 1 star but really it should be a half star. Funny they don't count half stars and don't tell people that. \\n\\nEveryone should come back and change their half to a 1 to get past this rate rigging system.","true":true}
