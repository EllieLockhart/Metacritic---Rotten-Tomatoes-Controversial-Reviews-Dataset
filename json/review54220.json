Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you forget all the people spouting off their predictions over the last few years\\, and realize that they are NOT recreating Empire Strikes Back (although giving a few subtle nods to it)\\, then you will enjoy it. I've been a fan since '77\\, and am not disappointed by this movie in any way; in fact I have seen it twice within a week of its release.","true":true}
