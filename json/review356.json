Here we have a game that was supposed to come out on the Playstation 3\\, and yet it is just now coming out as Playstation 4 exclusive. This is almost never a good sign\\, as games made under these conditions generally tend to have outdated graphics and sub-par gameplay. It leaves one wondering why and how the game got stuck in development hell. Topping it all off\\, Until Dawn is another \\\"movie game\\\"\\, like The Order 1866; 1866 was met with a lot of mixed reviews\\, most less than flattering.  All that being said\\, I am a big fan of horror\\, and so I decided to preorder it anyway. I went to GameStop in the morning to pick up my copy. \\\"You look like you're here to pick up Madden\\\" the GameStop employee said as I walked up to the counter...; the horror had already begun.  Sports games!?  My worst nightmare! As soon as I got my copy of Until Dawn I fled GameStop\\, then rushed home to give it a try.  I delved into Until Dawn with an open mind\\, despite all of my worries.  Right off the bat my worries began to fade.  This doesn't look like a Playstation 3 game at all!  The graphics are phenomenal; some of the best I've seen.  The characters are very well rendered with superb acting behind them\\, and the storyline was immediately engaging. I braced myself for a long day of gaming. Oh boy here we go...\r\rThis review will have no spoilers\\, with the exception for some very minor things from the first 15 minutes of the story. Until Dawn has it's tongue in it's cheek from start to finish. The game is intentionally silly\\, with dumb characters who want to explore strange noises alone.  It includes cliches from teen horror movies ranging from the 80s to present day.\r\rThe story starts off with a group of 10 friends who are going to a remote cabin retreat.  A prank is played on one of them\\, and she becomes upset. In her bout of anger\\, she runs out of the cabin in disgust\\, with her sister trailing her. The duo never return\\, and their bodies are never found despite a search of the area. Fast forward to one year later. The eight remaining friends return to the cabin on the one year anniversary of their friends death. Upon arriving at the cabin\\, there is one thing on their minds - to put the past behind them\\, seek forgiveness\\, and have a good time.  Too bad for them there is some maniac stalking them\\, wanting to kill them all.  Who is this person?  Is this the same person responsible for their missing friends one year ago? How many leave the cabin alive is up to you; you end up choosing how many of them survive; all\\, none or any variant therein. This ability within the game leads to many possibilities for the player\\, allowing each player can make the gameplay their own. I thought that was pretty neat\\, as well as effectively encouraging multiple play-throughs.\r\rUntil Dawn is a \\\"movie game\\\".  There is minimal gameplay; mostly quick time events and making difficult choices that affect the outcome of the game.  You also get to explore some atmospheric areas and there are some elements of combat as well.  Despite the minimal gameplay it's still a lot of fun and a roller coaster ride from start to finish.  It's always intense\\, scary as all hell\\, and out to get you. Until Dawn is well paced\\, and by well paced I mean you'll be **** your pants every 10 seconds.  The sound design and music are nothing short of top notch.  The music will make you clench your butt cheeks.  Every creepy sound will increase your heart rate and anxiety level. For the full audio experience\\, headphones are an absolute must when playing Until Dawn.  The graphics\\, as I said before\\, are incredible from both a technical and artistic standpoint.  The cabin is creepy and the snow drenched mountain wherein it lies is beautiful.  You will\\, of course\\, explore a lot of other areas; but that would be spoiling it for you.  Speaking of spoilers\\, there are a lot of good twists and turns within the game.  Most of them are very smart\\, despite the aforementioned overall silliness of the game.\r\rI stayed up until dawn playing Until Dawn. I simply couldn't bring myself to stop until it was over and the credits rolled.  When it was all over\\, which took around 7 hours\\, I was left wanting more.  I never expected Until Dawn to be anywhere near as good as it is.  It really shouldn't be this good; it's just another \\\"movie game\\\" like The Order: 1866.  But it is obvious that the developers had a clear image in their mind of what they wanted the game to be\\, and they brought that vision to life. Their success even makes games like Heavy Rain seem somehow lacking in comparison.  A lot of people will talk badly about all of these \\\"movie games\\\" but if they're learning from Until Dawn then bring 'em on. So was Until Dawn a Playstation 3 port as I first expected? Nope. Not even close. Until Dawn is a complete next gen experience from start to finish that is just as fun to watch as it is to play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
