Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film about moody teenagers. \\n\\nPoor character\/story development\\, not engaged with the actors at any point. Story Line = Plot holes galore. \\n\\nMovie felt like a tacky advert to sell Disney merchandise\\, for example the penguins with large eyes\\, which repeatedly appeared for no apparent reason whatsoever. Another example would be the necklace\\, which again was given far to much screen time\\, and played no real importance in the movie. \\n\\nA Star Wars film by Disney is just an advert for toys\\, just in time for filling up kids Christmas stockings.","true":true}
