Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. I've been a star wars fan since I was a child and have loved every movie until Disney got their hands on it. This movie has actually made me not care about the future of the story. Legendary characters have been forever ruined and the moderately interesting details about the new characters unfolded to be boring\\, unexplained or just plain ignored. It will take a miracle to save the franchise after Rian Johnson left it in a butchered bloody mess. Until I hear positive fan reviews I will not watch any future star wars films in the cinema again. Good luck JJ Abrams....seriously.","true":true}
