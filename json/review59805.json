The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok\\, to begin with\\, I will start by giving my opinion about the gameplay. People have said that the gameplay seems repetitive and\\, at times\\, boring because of its resemblance to the first game. You cannot change the main essence of the saga\\, which is the gameplay. Obviously new movement options have been added such as crawling or climbing.\r\rSpeaking now of the graphics section\\, there is not much to say. It is one of the best games in terms of graphics\\, and yet people continue to put mediocre marks\\, anyway.\r\rSpeaking of the political issue\\, people have strongly criticized this game for its supposed progressive political propaganda. It doesn't bother me that there are LGTBI characters\\, what's more\\, I think this needs to be normalized. What this game has wanted to show is that you can create characters with their own personality. There are people who are surprised to see that Ellie is a lesbian when she has been since the first game\\, and people are scared. I do not understand why.\r\rSpeaking a bit about the story and the main plot\\, I think it was a great idea to have created another character (Abby)\\, and use it to put Joel's death in perspective\\, and I think that is something that very few people ever understand. Abby is not a bad character\\, her behavior goes through something. We hate her for what she's done to Joel\\, but people don't remember who Joel was in the first game\\, he was a smuggler\\, a bad person. It wouldn't be fair for him to die a hero in this second game either.\rThe temporal jumps are also a good idea to understand the history\\, instead of switching all the history between controlling Ellie and Abby\\, is better to play 6 hours with one a nd then play another 6 hours with the other\\,\r\rTo sum up\\, this game does not deserve a 10\\, but neither is it a game of 5 or 6 as many people describe it. There is a lot of work behind this game\\, and for me\\, it has been one of the best of the generation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
