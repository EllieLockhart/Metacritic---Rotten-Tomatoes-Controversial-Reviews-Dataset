The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have to give this game a 10\/10 review\\, due to there are so many unreasonable negative reviews\\, and this game completes the whole story.First\\, the story is good\\, and it does not deserve like 3\\, 2 or even 0 of 10. I know some of the elements in this game might anger many people\\, such as SJW and multi-cultural as well. However\\, you can say you hate these elements\\, but you cannot destroy the game via some unreasonable and unreal reviews. I might only give it an 8 or 9 before I saw the whole internet is like bullying the creator and the team of this game. I really hate this phenomenon\\, like I am living in some kind of censorship country.Second\\, there is a reason it calls part 2 instead of the last of us 2. In my opinion\\, the last of us part 2 complete and extend the whole story behind the previous game in 2013. There must be a consequence when you against the world benefit to save personal interest\\, and the result is not just the dead of Joel. It is the struggle between Ellie and Abby. Obviously. Abby is a nice and ordinary girl who just wants to revenge her father's death\\, and she let Ellie\\, with killing intension\\, go twice. Does Ellie know it? Yes\\, she knows why Abby killed Joel\\, she knows Abby only goes to Joel\\, and She knows Abby let her go twice and did not kill Dina. This is the reason why Ellie's last trip is so unstable and with so many unsure. And it turns out\\, Ellie let Abby go when she can kill her. Because she found that what she wants is not Abby's death\\, it is not revenge. She just wants peace and the get rip of the moment of Joel's death.  She is not sure that killing Abby can give her peace or not\\, so she does what Abby has done to her...let her go and never come back. There are so many things in this story... I am going to play the second round.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
