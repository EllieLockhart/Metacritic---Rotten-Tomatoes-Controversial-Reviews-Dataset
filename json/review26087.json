Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only is this the worst Star Wars sequel\\, it may also be the worst sequel of the past 10 years. I think it is a disgrace that these sell out actual critics gave it such a high score. It just goes to show how powerful companies can pay off anyone. I can go on and on about how this movie was poorly written\\, poorly acted\\, and didn't do anything for the Star Wars universe except ruin one of the greatest heroes in movie history. I'll leave with two phrases that sum up this terrible movie and all it's done: Mary Poppins Leia and alien titty milk.","true":true}
