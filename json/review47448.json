Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What happened to the characters from the original trilogy? They've been dragged through the mud in order to embellish the new cast. This wasn't \\\"character development\\\" or \\\"evolution\\\"\\, it was an assassination. As soon as I left the movie theatre I felt like I'd done something wrong. I feel like such a victim for paying to see this movie and for being so emotionally invested in the franchise. I ran home and have been listening to Linkin Park - Numb for a couple of hours now\\, shaking.","true":true}
