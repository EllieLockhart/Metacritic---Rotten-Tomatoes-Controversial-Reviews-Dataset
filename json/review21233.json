Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this\\, not as a zealot of Star Wars but as a fan of story telling\\, and on this and this alone\\, it was completely disappointing. Characterization\\, overall plotting\\, and structure was so weak it was distracting. Huge parts of the story could have been edited out. Characters are not connecting\\, and simple pseudo-science logic is thrown out of the window. On the plus side\\, this was beautiful to look at and some of the fight scene choreography was a treat. That alone is not enough\\, when other studios are delivering on more than just visual effects and sound design. This IP has jumped the shark.","true":true}
