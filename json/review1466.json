Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, I find it very sad to see how narrow minded and intellectually lacking Star Wars fans can be. For a series that focuses on self reflection and the internal struggle between light and dark\\, you would think more fans would learn to look a little deeper. This movie is absolutely fantastic\\, and the most intriguing in the series. Look further than what is right in front of your face and stop whining about childish nostalgia. ","true":true}
