Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not insightful enough to be a movie critic but here goes. Admiral Ackbar should've been the one in command after Leia (they should have killed her off\\, Kylo being the one to do it) and Finn should've sacrificed himself (his and Rose's kiss was forced and cringy). Ackbar should've been the one to have kamikazed into the ship. It would've been poignant and bittersweet because no one gives a fuck about this purple-hair-lady we were just introduced to half an hour before. Also\\, how can it be \\\"reinventing Star Wars\\\" when it's basically the same shit we've seen before: rebels running away from the empire\\, escaping to a planet (*cough* Hoth & Endor anyone?)\\, are found out but ultimately have a Pyrrhic victory. Ugh\\, so disappointed. This is what happens when you leave a bunch of SJW's in charge of the franchise.","true":true}
