Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson clearly had a number of set pieces that he wanted in the movie. He then proceeded to cobble together a story around that. There is significant inattention to plot details and a disrespect of the Star Wars lore. The movie was visually stunning and my overall experience was positive. I hope JJ Abrams can address some of the unanswered questions in Episode IX. I also hope that the Lucasfilm story group assist in the writing of Rian Johnson's proposed new trilogy.","true":true}
