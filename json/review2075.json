Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie that takes a huge dump all over the original characters in place of boring\\, uninspiring and \\\"Mary-Sue-like\\\" new characters. If you're looking to see nostalgia or how the original characters turned out after Episode 6\\, don't bother. You'll only be faced with disappointment that you spent money on seeing it. I've had to change my rating from a 1\/2-star to a 1-star just so my review counts into the audience score!","true":true}
