Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the worst SW ever made\\, not only did it decide to destroy the original characters but destroy the lore established by 7 movies previously. Having said that it really is only continuing SW demise started by TFA.\\n\\nCinematography 10\/10 - Undoubtedly a very good looking film\\, with iconic imagery - all at the expense of plot and character development. \\n\\nSound 10\/10 - Score is great once again\\n\\nStory 0\/10 - character assassinations up the wazoo\\, Luke Skywalker a psychopathic hermit who does literally nothing. Plot holes the size of canyons you have to be lobotomised not to see. nonsensical character arcs that go nowhere and destroy what was laid in TFA. Plot threads that were subverted to nothing. On the nose SJW lessons for the audience. Just terrible. \\n\\nActing 5\/10 - phoned in by most of the actors but they didn't really have much to work with. Yoda Puppet was an utter insult\\, Mark Hamill bless the guy a consummate professional was easily the best actor on screen.\\n\\nSo if you want to watch a film which destroys 40 years of SW in one swoop whilst giving you two middle fingers and at the same time shafting you up the backside - I thoroughly recommend it for the masochist in you. Otherwise give it a wide birth - the SW story ended at EpVI RoTJ as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\nWould get a negative score but gets a 1 star because RT doesn't count 1\/2 stars apparently.","true":true}
