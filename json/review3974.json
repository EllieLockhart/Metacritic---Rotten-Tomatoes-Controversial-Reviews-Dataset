Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, long\\, and infuriating pointless. The parts that should be cool and awesome\\, like meeting Luke again after forever\\, are dumb and stupid\\, what was even up with the milking alien? The entire movie was a big disappointment\\, and real boring.","true":true}
