{"101487":145851,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been one of those die hard Star Wars Fans since I first seen Star Wars back in 77. As a child\\, Star Wars was like nothing I had ever seen and completely captured my imagination. I fell in love with the concept and the story back then and continued to be intrigued by how the story unfolded. I bought the books\\, toys\\, VHS tapes\\, DVDs and watched the movies so much that I could receipt almost every line for the first three.\\n\\nThe only Star Wars that I was completely satisfied with was Empire Strikes Back as it was just overall better than any other Star Wars movie. I didn't like the Ewoks at all in the Return of the Jedi\\, hated Jar Jar Binks\\, couldn't stand the sappy and stupid lines George came up with for Hayden Christensen that probably helped ruin his career and felt like Force Awakens was just a New Hope remake but was good overall.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi..\\n\\nIf you can see this in 3D then do it. The visuals are incredible in 3D and will help distract from the horrible confusing plot\\, lack of Character development and the direction they are taking Star Wars.. The space battles in 3D and the many of the effects lend very nicely to 3D without seeming over done and pushed for the 3D effect. \\n\\nNew Characters:\\nThey introduced a new bird... for selling toys...\\n\\nThey introduced a new girl that is less cool that her sister was... you'll understand once you see it...\\n\\nThe introduced another \\\"strong female character\\\" Admiral Holdo with purple hair (some women do this to recapture their youth) just to give her enough screen time for us to be glad when they didn't give her more.. see the movie and you will understand. \\n\\nOld Characters.. \\n\\nLuke Skywaker:\\nWe see the return of Luke Skywalker and after watching him\\, it totally made me understand why Hans Solo was the true star of Star Wars and a Fan favorite...\\n\\nCarrie Fisher\\nBest performance of her life but I'm not sure if she was actually alive...\\n\\nHan Solo\\\"\\nRelegated to a set of dice..\\n\\nR2D2\\nMust have been having some reliability problems for he basically turned around once and became a projection TV unit..\\n\\nC3PO\\nTried to tell everyone the \\\"chances of success\\\" line that really didn't mean anything\\n\\nYoda.. didn't add anything other than wondering why they are still using a Muppet in a modern film full of spectacular CGI.. I swear I could see somebodies thumb moving his lips...\\n\\nNewish Characters..\\n\\nRey... still doesn't know how to use a light saber and still doesn't \\\"know her place in all of this\\\"\\n\\nKylo... still throws fits as though he is a teenager and still doesn't know his role in all of this\\n\\nPhasma.... I really don't care as she is just ANOTHER \\\"strong female character\\\" introduced to be politically correct... Don't get me wrong I like females in roles but come on!! at least develop them so we give a hoot about who they are instead of pushing a political narrative..\\n\\nFinn... still Finn.. still a lucky Janitor... and still shocked by everything\\n\\nPo... overall the strongest character in the movie and his lines\\, plot and Character development makes sense for his role.\\n\\nBottom line:\\nStar Wars\\, The Last Jedi is like any other modern movie to date.. fast and loose on the plot\\, no real Character development\\, lack of an actual script\\, lack of an actual direction of where they want to take the sequels and wonderful CGI..\\n\\nThe one thing that is for sure in Hollywood; They are making it so if there was a writer strike\\, we the audience wouldn't notice...","true":true}
