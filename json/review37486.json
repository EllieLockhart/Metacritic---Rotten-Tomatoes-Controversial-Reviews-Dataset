Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some glaring issues with the movie which countless critics have overlooked. Namely\\, the side-story with Canto Bight which SW's own PR people had to defend on facebook\\, the sub-plot with Finn and Rose\\, the disconnect with the mysteries JJ set up in TFA\\, & the kamikaze scene. There are others\\, but the critics who have rated the movie well have seemed to overlook these points. \\n\\nTo be clear\\, there is no secret agenda with the audience reviews. I've liked every other Star Wars movie before this\\, including Rogue One and The Force Awakens. This movie was simply not well executed.","true":true}
