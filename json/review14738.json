Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea why there is so much negativity about this film. I saw the first one at the cinema when I was 13 and totally fell in love with it. I cannot calculate how many times I have watched them. The first tow in this trilogy I have enjoyed a lot. Neither of them have been perfect but that would be impossible but they have both been very enjoyable and emotional. Luke\\, Leia and Han Solo are all older now\\, like myself. I read someone saying that the Phantom Menace was better. I'm not sure what they have been sniffing but it must screw with your head somewhat. I also get the feeling that some are upset due to the diversity of the new cast. Boohoo films don't just have white men in them now. How awful for you.","true":true}
