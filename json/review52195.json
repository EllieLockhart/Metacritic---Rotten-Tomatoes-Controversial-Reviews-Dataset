Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching the force awakens some 2 years ago now\\, I felt hopeful that once again Star Wars was heading in the right direction! The last Jedi has firmly cemented this idea within my heart! A fresh take on a beloved franchise with the idea that after 9 films not everything is as black and white as once was thought! The Jedi aren't all that's good in the galaxy and every character is expendable! A refreshing take and well up there with one of the best Star Wars films to date! All I can say well done Rian Johnson and I can't wait to see episode 9 and the next chapter of this exciting and fresh saga!","true":true}
