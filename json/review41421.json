Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is another step down the path towards the dark side of destroying Star Wars as an artistic work.\\nMost of the characters make decisions that have no foundation in reason simply because it allows them to extend the duration of the film with pointless scenes; old Star Wars characters act in a way that any Star Wars fan will tell you is 100% inconsistent with everything that we know about them simply because it allows the writers to construct a moral dilemma for the new characters; sub-plots and intriguing story aspects set up in episode VII are crushed\\, removed\\, or cut short with zero explanation\\, zero answers\\, and in some cases zero mention; the comic relief that is customary in Star Wars films has been taken to a jarring extreme where jokes are nonsensically and inappropriately squeezed into otherwise intense and dramatic sequences and serve to bring the emotional flow of the film to a sudden and screeching halt; it proposes potentially interesting and fresh new takes on the political and economic structure of the accepted Star Wars universe that has real-world ties only to immediately forget about it with no pay-off and no promise of further exploration; it continues the power creep of the force that has existed in Star Wars since the prequels\\, but takes it to the extent that the force is now nothing more than a simple plot device that allows them to maintain a constant uncertainty about what will happen to the main characters because any force sensitive person no matter how untrained can do literally anything as if they were god; and the plot holes...oh GOD THE PLOT HOLES!!!!!\\n\\nThis film is not Star Wars. This film is a stream of market-tested hollywood explosions\\, cute animal scenes\\, and a whole lot of he's dead\/he's not dead\/he's dead\/he's not dead\/ etc. ad infinitum with the words \\\"Star Wars\\\" simply slapped on at the end. I am tempted to attribute a lot of the problems with this movie relative to the previous film to the 180 degree pivot as a result of the change in director and writers. However\\, episode VII suffered from many of these same problems\\, although to a lesser degree. I am forced to conclude that the creators of these new Star Wars films have no love for the source material and are really just making a safe financial bet by making Star Wars films.\\nThere are bits of the film that are enjoyable\\, no question. Unfortunately\\, the context of those bits only serves to sour them and leave you wondering why they would go to such lengths and spend so much money to ruin something that you love. Immediately after leaving the theater\\, I tried for several hours to justify parts of the film and decisions that were made. I tried desperately to cling to the hope that all was not lost\\, but I certainly had a bad feeling about this...the more I considered it\\, the more I was forced to come to the realization that it had succeeded in twisting Star Wars into a strange and dissatisfying shape that is only recognizable by the beams of blue and red light emanating from the sticks in its hands.\\n\\nThe film is designed from the ground up to appeal to the uninvested\\, the uninterested\\, and the inattentive. As a result\\, it will probably succeed in hooking young children who will get their parents to buy toys\\, video games\\, and movie tickets. It will probably also succeed reasonably well among those adults who don't pay much attention to the content of movies and just watch them for explosions and surprises. But to those of you who care about stories and film as an artistic medium and certainly to those of you who love Star Wars for what it was\\, I advise you to save yourself the pain of seeing this film.","true":true}
