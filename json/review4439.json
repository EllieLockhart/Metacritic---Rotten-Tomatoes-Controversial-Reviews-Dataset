Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Certainly not the best in the series\\, but had so much potential. Love the cast and the acting\\, but I wonder what Rian was thinking with some of the dialogue\\, the not at all subtle political critique of the rich (which I agree with\\, but which could have been done much better)\\, and the totally physics defying fight scene between Kylo Ren and Luke. They are literally clanging light sabers and then somehow in the next shot running towards each other from 30 feet away. Whuh? Definitely like the critique of weapons manufacturers and the military industrial complex. Other tension building aspects of the plot just felt a bit clunky. Worth seeing\\, but don't expect this to be as phenomenal as many reviewers have made this out to be.","true":true}
