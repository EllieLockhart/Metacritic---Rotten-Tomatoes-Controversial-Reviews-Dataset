Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a piece of trash movie. I am a huge Star Wars fan and this movie is garbage. Luke is shown as a whiny recluse whose big redemption is to be a holographic decoy and then disappear. Snoke dies like a bad aim stormtrooper. Rey gets no training at all and is a Jedi master now. How cool would it have been for Luke to walk in and kick snokes ass when he had rey or fly in in his x wing and light up those at at and then fight kylo. Even Leia\\,whose force powerful enough now to survive with no oxygen in deep space.... doesn't know he's a hologram??? And those sent messages.( THEY KEPT REFERENCING) to all ends of the galaxy and no one came. Nobody be surprised when JJ brings Starfleet and Captain Kirk to the rescue in IX. They ruined my childhood favorite. I tried hard to like it\\, but its unlikable\\,too long with no character development\\, just depressing. Don't forget those way too fast ships that the first order can't catch. Too bad they don't have tie fighters to chase them down........ And some dam strong shields tooo. But just set their and aimlessly shoot at them.fans like a good space battle......","true":true}
