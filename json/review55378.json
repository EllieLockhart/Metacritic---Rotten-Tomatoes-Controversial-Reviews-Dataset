Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie but at the same time was utterly annoyed at some choices of RJ.  Three words....\\\"Luke Deserved Better\\\".  I can live with the annoyance of Rey's reveal and will get over the utter uselessness of Snoke.  However\\, when you combine that with the utter disappointment of they handed Luke?  I just can't recall another movie I loved so much but was annoyed at simultaneously.  There was so much to love in this film.  So much fan service that just with a few takes this could have been the best or at least the second best Star Wars movie ever.  As of now it ranks below Empire\\, Rogue One and The Force Awakens.  Top 4 still makes for an epic movie and one I highly recommend.  The visuals are stunning and I love the new characters.  A scene with Kylo\/Rey will go down as one of my all time favorites.","true":true}
