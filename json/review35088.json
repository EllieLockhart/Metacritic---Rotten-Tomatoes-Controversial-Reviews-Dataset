Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**THE FOLLOWING MOVIE REVIEW OF THE LAST JEDI IS SPOILER FREE**\\nFor a saga that has much expectation for both story and substance\\, Star Wars can be a literal mountain to overcome when developing a new set of characters and plot lines.\\nRian Johnson's The Last Jedi has surely been the most anticipated film of the year. After the sweeping success of both Rogue One and The Force Awakens\\, Disney turned to the Looper director\\, which scratched many heads both within the company and in the entertainment industry abroad. How can this unconventional\\, visually stunning director be passed such an enormous and burdening torch?\\nLuckily for everyone involved\\, Johnson was ready to wield that torch. A mega-fan himself\\, Johnson has idolized the Star Wars canon since a very young age. From throwing recently built models of The Millennium Falcon across his room to see if it would fly\\, to actually boarding the real starship itself\\, is what made Johnson so dedicated to progress the series\\, albeit with his own flair.\\nThe speculation for the plot of The Last Jedi has led many fans down a spiraling\\, conspiracy-filled rabbit hole for over two years. Because of that\\, many will walk in to the theatre with a plot already signed\\, sealed\\, and developed. The problem is\\, Johnson didn't get the memo\\, and he took the film into uncharted territory never before seen for the series. Every guess you have made for this film is most likely wrong. Where you expect to turn right\\, you do a barrel roll and then an immediate u-turn. Yeah\\, crazy stuff\\, I know.\\nWhile critics\\, both professional and amateur\\, have highly acclaimed the movie already\\, many fans have been left disgruntled and\\, for some\\, quite upset. The surprises of how unexpected and unprecedented this plot was\\, has left some fans reeling into an unmitigated frustration with Johnson and Disney\/Lucasfilm. Some diehards will say it was a disappointment\\, maybe the worst of all the movies\\, and a select few\\, ruined the entire series for them.\\nTo that\\, I say this: while I almost fell out of my seat several times last night\\, every unorthodox move Johnson presented to me was brilliant. This new trilogy we are experiencing today\\, in an age of advanced CGI and special effects\\, and in a time where the first generation of Star Wars fans are now making the very movies they so dearly adored as children\\, change is only inevitable and needed. The beloved characters\\, creators\\, droids\\, and planets we've loved\\, in a galaxy we have been escaping to for so long\\, are evolving in their own natural right.\\nWhile Episode VIII wasn't what we expected\\, and for some\\, wanted\\, the film truly captures where the series ought to go\\, and for me\\, that destination is a scary\\, and wonderfully magical place. 5 stars.","true":true}
