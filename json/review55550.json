Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No one's ever really gone... Rey's journey continues and the Skywalker saga concludes in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\\n\\nThere's nostalgia bait and references to past movies and other established cannon\\, just a step away from the \\\"wink wink\\, nudge nudge. Did you see what we did there?\\\" type of references. The visuals are amazing and the spectacle is just as amazing. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver give their best performances of the series. The music is even more amazing courteous of John Williams which greatly enhances the movie and highlights how important a soundtrack is for a movie.\\n\\nThe Rise of Skywalker rarely comes close to touching greatness. The film tries to fit in so much it threatens to tear apart at the seams\\, but ultimately rises to the impossible occasion to complete the saga. 7.5\/10\\n\\n\\n\\nDirector: J.J.
