Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Only Ryan Johnson had read the fan theories!!  This movie was a dissapointment.  Super slow space chase!!   Luke Skywalkers character!!  Snoke Dying! ( hoping he regenerates or that was his force projection!   I wonder if Abrams would have taken Luke in a different direction.   Some real pointless stuff in this movie.  Laura Dern waiting to turn ship around till half the transports were blown away!  Ugh my sons and I are huge fans and this movie dissapointed in so many ways.  Not sure I'll go see the next one in theaters.","true":true}
