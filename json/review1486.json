Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge fan of Star Wars I was disappointed when i came out of the theater on opening night. It\u2019s fine if you loved this movie i didn\u2019t love it I liked it\\, it was a fun movie but it had a lot of problems that need to be acknowledged. I didn\u2019t hate this movie there were parts that I enjoyed but i hated the first hour of this film. I am usually fine with slow movies but I was not okay with this it was to slow. And there were too many side plots. There was this scene where they go to a casino that was not needed at all. And without going into spoilers Luke is a real dick in this movie and I feel like that doesn\u2019t capture the spirit of the character we loved from the original trilogy. Also there were too many damn porgs. Characters that we love are underutilized and if you loved this movie I think you are in denial and in a few years will realize that this wasn\u2019t a very good film and it is only a little above the prequels quality wise.","true":true}
