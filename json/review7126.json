Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable\\, but rather disappointing. I expected more. I loved The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, and therefore had high hopes for The last Jedi. Unfortunately the story was convoluted\\, and I hated the subplot with Finn and Rose-it was pointless and their dialogue was often cheesy. The high points happened along Rey\u2019s story\\, and the bits of comedy added a nice levity. I hope for better with the last installment.","true":true}
