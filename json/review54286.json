Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with StarWars and these last movies were totally off Character for what we were expecting to see.  They took Luke Skywalker and made him feeble and weak.  Totally glorifying the girl Rey as they do students in school by giving her  a Participation trophy of jedi Skills without earning anything.  Totally Dissapointed with this movie.  \\nIt glorifies snowflake mentality and Hollywood should look at George L for direction .  Even Mark Hamill thinks it sucks.  When you make a sequel \\, stick to the original vision. DO NOT DEVIATE!\\nIt's like going to a restaurant ordering steak and they bring you pop tarts. And tell you that's a steak? Fuk Hollywood","true":true}
