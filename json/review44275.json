Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long\\, too many scenes that were more suitable for a Spaceballs movie (The search for more money) than for Star Wars\\, too much fan pleasing\\, too many plot holes and dumb \\\"b\/c of plot\\\" decisions\\, too many ending and plotlines. Too similar to a Marvel\/Pirates of the Caribbean. This is not a Star Wars movie and should never have been made. \\n#sad\\n#failed\\n#ShouldHaveEndedatAtVI\\n#SearchforMoreMoney","true":true}
