Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out in disbelief of what I had just seen. Despite one silly pointless subplot this movie had some of my now favorite scenes in the franchise. I understand it may be hard for audiences to see something stray this far from the originals but holy hell does it deliver the most unexpected Star Wars movie. This movie was amazing and I can't wait to see what he does with his own trilogy. Hopefully the audiences will be able to see this movie for the brave and awesome step forward for the franchise and their opinions will change. Remember how different Empire was from A New Hope? It was a completely different movie. The Force Awakens was familair and played off of what we knew from A New Hope.....and this movie does something different and in my opinion amazing.","true":true}
