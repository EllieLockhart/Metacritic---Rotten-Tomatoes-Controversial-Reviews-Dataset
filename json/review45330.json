Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly abysmal.\\nCould not even maintain continuity with the previous episode never mind the other the films.\\nLazer swords FFS? Poor Mark Hamill. Luke's character was treated so shabbily.\\nThe hyperspace ram removes all jeopardy from the previous films and all subsequent space battles; predicated by the most pointless space chase ever conceived. How come a Star Destroyer was able to catch up with and engulf  Leia's ship in the first minutes of A \\\"New Hope\\\" but now suddenly the Empire ships can't keep up?\\nThe space-cow milking scene. That had to be a director dig or \\\"in-joke\\\" about milking the franchise. Just horrendous. Chewie was the only thing left untainted. Awful\\, awful\\, awful.","true":true}
