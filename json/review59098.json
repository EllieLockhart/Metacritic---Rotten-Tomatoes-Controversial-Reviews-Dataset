Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Hi\\, the people who get free stuff or paid or influence\\, I'm not hate for what you said play the game until the end (that your view)\\, for my view i value my game by seeing the content first what can they offer so i can enjoy too\\, that your job to make that review and say it to us in honest\\, from what i see so far\\, the critics is lying to us just give blind score. The surprise mechanic that not my cup of tea in term of multiplayer game (that obvious) and single player content for storytelling.\r\rLet cut to the chase\\, the last of us part 2 three clear points:\r-Game play is OK and futuristic\r**** and garbage narrative that cringe a lot\\, don't ever compare part 2 (trash) is better than original the last of us\r-Betrayed the fans base (i'm joel fans btw) (play **** of ton original tlou)\r\rTruth is i don't buy or own this woke game from the start\\, why\\, Neil also say he told you that he make a game that people will be hate\\, so Neil you deserve it even the sale million copies (I DON'T CARE)\\, the **** story tell me enough not ever spend any dime that make you cringe when the time abby get what she or he deserve (OBVIOUSLY NOT IN FULL PRICE OR IN SALE)\\, spend it to cyberpunk 2077 and ghost tsushima that is not a left game.
