Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning and dramatically epic\\, The Last Jedi is everything The Force Awakens should have been: a space western. Building more off of what George Lucas started with the franchise than Abrams action-packed Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi has tension and drama that fills a short plot\\, and makes up for its less than strong start with ease\\, despite its meaningless side plots. Any flaws aside\\, there's nothing like an epic Star Wars film\\, and this fits the bill.","true":true}
