Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched it twice\\, because the first time I was in shock. Second time I wanted a refund. Utterly awful Star Wars film\\, I won't be adding this to my collection. Disney are now aiming this at a general audience for a quick profit\\, which is sad because I thought they actually cared about the 'product' so much for that. What's with Rian Johnson introducing drugs into Star Wars - Blue Milk? Luke tripping out? WTF.","true":true}
