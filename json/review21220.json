Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this again today to see how I felt about it. It\u2019s honestly shocking how bad the decisions were in this movie. We never see Luke skywalker fight..ONCE???? Snoke is no one? Rey\u2019s parents...no one. I would basically bet my life that Rian Johnson was not a Star Wars fan. No Star Wars fan would make the decisions he did.","true":true}
