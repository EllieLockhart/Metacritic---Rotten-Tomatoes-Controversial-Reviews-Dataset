Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard Star Wars fan who loves the original 3 and TFA\\, I can't believe how often I thought during the movie how rediculous of a movie this was. So many plot holes\\, so many cliche scenes (Luke's The Matrix fight scene\\, Leah flying through space with the force?)\\, so many childish jokes\\, so many meaningless merchandise characters. So disappointing.","true":true}
