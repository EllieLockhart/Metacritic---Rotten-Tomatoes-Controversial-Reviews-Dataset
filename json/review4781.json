Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ruined the Star Wars universe for me. Horrible story line and in a way stole  and destroyed the unique opportunity Rian J was given.  Killing off key characters  we can never get back.  I watched this movie with my 13 year old daughter and she said\\, \\\"dad\\, I know you liked Star Wars at my age but I don't. Is that OK ?\\\"  \\nSeriously\\, Disney really ruined the franchise with this rubbish.","true":true}
