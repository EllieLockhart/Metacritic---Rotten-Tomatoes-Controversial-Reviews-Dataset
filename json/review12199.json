Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a woman\\, OK? So don't assume this is just a negative review from some Star Wars fanboy. This film exactly what we should all expect from Disney: anti-masculine\\, SJW crap. The message to us women is that if we want masculine strength in our imagination (art\\, media and personal fantasy) or in our real life\\, then we just want abuse because men have to be emasculated in order to be good. The message is clear: strong\\, confident\\, wise\\, powerful males will not be tolerated. Go to hell Disney..along with every think tank\\, university and social manipulator who continues to push this trope. This is weaponized feminism and has nothing to do with what women really want\\, feel or need to be whole.","true":true}
