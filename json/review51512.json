Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A completely compelling fresh take on a universe that\\, in recent years has been stuggling with a stale tone and has fallen for its own tropes\\, The Last Jedi defies expectations\\, logically works with it's pre established characters and gives a fresh perspective on the force. This film is not for Star Wars fans and it's biggest problem is it is called \\\"Star Wars\\\".","true":true}
