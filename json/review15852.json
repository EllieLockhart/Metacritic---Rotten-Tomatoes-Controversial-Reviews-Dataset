Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love that most of the chances Rian Johnson took worked\\, and that the bold move of showing Luke as a broken Jedi worked for those of us who are invested in more than just the films - the people who complain about this movie not living up to the legend of Luke obviously don't read any of the Canon books or comics.","true":true}
