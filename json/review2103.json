Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the oppressive forces of super-nerddom close in around me like an Imperial Death Squadron in pursuit of a rogue rebel ship\\, I'm reminded of how exhausting it must be to be a Star Wars purist. Do these people get any joy out of anything other than mother's speedy basement food-delivery service? If being a fanatic means not being able to enjoy a movie as interesting as The Last Jedi\\, that is a full-time job I have no interest in.","true":true}
