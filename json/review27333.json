Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oof\\, disappointing is a good way to describe Last Jedi. Disney has to be wondering if handing the reins of one of its most popular franchises was done a little too soon. Shallow writing is exposed by actors who were great in Force Awakens but now seem generally clueless as to where they are\\, what's going on or what their role is. Brief comedic moments and sporadic action sequences are extremely few and far between\\, and when you do get one\\, it's comically short. There's a profound lack of lore and background where it's needed most. Last Jedi is definitely better than Episodes 1-3\\, but it'd be a reach to rank it higher than that\\, which is harrowing considering how great Awakens set it up and the promise it's built off of for two years.","true":true}
