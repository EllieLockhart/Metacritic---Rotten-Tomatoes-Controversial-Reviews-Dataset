Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This particular sermon is unlikely to convert anyone to the Church of Jedi.   As best I can tell there were lots of preachers yelling about goodness and light and lecturing on fire and brimstone - all backed with the appropriate visuals.  Most of the other dialogue made literally no sense to me and I had no idea where anyone was at any given time or why they were going where-ever they were going.","true":true}
