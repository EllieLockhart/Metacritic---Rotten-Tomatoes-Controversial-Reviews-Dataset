Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of hate from fans in these early reviews\\, but I loved it. It added to the cannon while still feeling like a Star Wars film. And to anyone who says that Star Wars movies are serious and shouldn't be funny\\, get over yourselves.","true":true}
