Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account just to cast my vote on this turd of a movie (1\/2 stars don't count towards the score so I've read or I would have rated lower) . Mostly for the same reoccurring points people have been making so I'm not going to illustrate all my reasons . I agree with China ! this movie insults your intelligence and all the effects and CGI at their disposal don't make up for this.. . You cannot polish a turd ! TFA had some dumb stuff and things that didn't make sense but at least it had good characters and the hopes that those things that didn't make sense would come be developed in the next film . TLJ made me hate TFA now and have no desire to pay to see the next one . I really don't even care if I see it for free ...","true":true}
