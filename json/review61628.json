The only true improvement to gameplay was the addition of proning. However it doesn't do enough to make the game stand too far out from the original. The only redeeming quality of The Last Of Us 2 is the beautiful world design and graphics.\r\rOverall\\, this game boils down to a storytelling game with bad storytelling and outdated gameplay mechanics. I highly advise you stay far away from this game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
