Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has left viewers polarized in much the same way that \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" did so many years ago.  I was left on the edge of my seat several times\\, the storyline itself gripped me (though there were some elements of cheese - it is Star Wars\\, after all)\\, and I can't wait to see it again!  Mark Hamill may well be part of an Oscar nomination campaign...and Carrie Fisher's appearance takes on a new poignancy.","true":true}
