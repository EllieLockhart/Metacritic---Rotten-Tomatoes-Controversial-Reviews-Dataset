Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie of them all and the most disappointing. JJ Abrams set this film up to be decent enough and despite TFA just being 'A New Hope' with subtle differences\\, TFA's fan service was perhaps needed after such a long time since the original trilogy. \\n\\nThe whole Canto Bight scene is not needed needed. Rose was a frustrating character; would have been a great death for Finn if he had have flown into the laser. Vice Admiral Holdo's deception for no reason was infuriating to watch. Also fuel in Star Wars is a silly concept having there been no mention of it before. Ray's parents not explained and Snoke not explained.","true":true}
