Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love this movie\\, because Luke Skywalker was returned on the big screen and I got to say this movie is good. But\\, I felt very sad about Carrie Fisher passed away\\, because she won\u2019t be in the last installment of Star Wars sequel trilogy. I hope they will make the last movie someday.","true":true}
