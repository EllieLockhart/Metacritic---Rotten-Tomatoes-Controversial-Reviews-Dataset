Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me preface this by saying\\, as a Star Wars movie\\, this isn't any more objectionable than any previous installments.  It's a functional\\, sometimes entertaining\\, occasionally jaw dropping\\, Star Wars movie.  But as a Film with a capital F\\, it is a total narrative mess.  This movie should be shown to film students as a case study of the failings of Hollywood blockbuster cinema.\\n\\nI won't even get too far into the baffling nonsense of some of the plot elements.  Let's just say that the movie begins with a fleet of resistance bombers hyperspacing into a battle several hundred yards from their target\\, and then glacially inching forward while they are predictably destroyed one by one\\, and that this is not the most contrived or silly plot element introduced...that award probably goes to the fact that a significant chunk of the conflict in the movie could've been dispelled by even the shortest of conversations between Hondo and Poe (signal for poor screen writing: artificially keeping characters in the dark on key information so that drama can be built from their inevitable misunderstandings).  There's a lot of this stuff that just doesn't make sense\\, but this franchise has never held itself to the highest standards in that regard so one can get past it.\\n\\nWhat does upset me about this movie is that it spends a considerable amount of time developing a narrative that it ultimately betrays and throws out entirely in the last 30 minutes.  There are breadcrumbs for an interesting movie here\\, where things are more much complicated than merely \\\"Resistance vs. Empire\\\"\\, \\\"Jedi vs. Sith\\\"\\, and the movie does a good job of sending signals through the first few acts that it wants us to look deeper at this (apparently) never ending war between flawed antagonists who've been granted superhuman powers.  Then we get to the end of the movie\\, and it's either the director\\, or Disney\\, or both\\, who blinks.  Nuance is thrown out the window\\, all of those interesting ideas are given a big \\\"Nevermind!\\\"\\, and we're back to the same old simplistic face-off between virtue and evil we've been watching for decades now.  \\n\\nThis movie doesn't have the courage to live up to what were\\, as expressed earlier in the film\\, it's apparent convictions.  This is both maddening as a viewer\\, because the movie has a habit of leading you down paths that eventually go nowhere (for a plot example: the entire casino thread)\\, and disappointing intellectually because you're left thinking about what this movie could've been if its makers hadn't blinked in the end and reverted back to the franchise's (now a bit tired) formula.  This type of safe film making has typified the last two installments of Star Wars.  The first movie got a pass for not taking any risks because we were just all so thirsty to see these characters and this world again.  This movie less so\\, because at this point the groundwork has been laid\\, characters introduced\\, fans appeased\\, and now was the time to expand and challenge the universe as all good sequels are expected to.  Far from expanding\\, the movie betrays itself and its own characters to the extent that the two biggies\\, Kylo and Rey\\, end the film in less interesting places than they started it (the descent from complicated creatures into paragons of virtue or vice is not an improvement in my book)\\, and instead of being dramatic the final act feels like just another face-off between the good guys and bad guys\\, where the visuals are the only thing that's new.\\n\\nThis movie fails spectacularly in the task of all sequels\\, namely to take the previous film's ingredients in a new and interesting directions\\, all the more so because it clearly is aware that some iconoclasm is warranted\\, but when push comes to shove it either backs off entirely or heavily dilutes it with forced levity.  So while this movie was certainly more entertaining to watch than many of its predecessors\\, the opportunities it squanders via either timidity or failed execution leave it as one of the most disappointing Star Wars films I've ever seen.","true":true}
