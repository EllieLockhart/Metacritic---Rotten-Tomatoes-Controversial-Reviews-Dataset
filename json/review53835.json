Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heartbroken\\, and oddly betrayed\\, at the disrespectful treatment of Luke Skywalker's character (and to that end of Mark Hamill and his own views on how he would have approached Luke). It's only a movie you say! Sure\\, I get that. But I have to be truthful to what I feel. For me it was Luke that embodied the spirit of Star Wars. This sequel could have been so magnificent in concluding Luke and Leia's story. Rey went to find Luke. She found him at the end of the world because this was his Odyssey. Rey had HEARD of Luke Skywalker even in that backwater where she was abandoned. The story is about Luke\/Leia\\, the children of Anakin! Every generation that has watched Star Wars knows this about Luke. He is the link between Anakin and Kylo. \\n\\nMr Rian Johnson you betrayed the very essence of the human spirit that Luke was and is.","true":true}
