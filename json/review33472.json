Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. A spit in the face of longtime fans of the OT\\, a departure from Joseph Cambell's Hero's Journey. Rey is an empty character without flaws sacrifice\\, or conseqence\\, and Luke Skywalker is disposed of in an uncerimonious fashion.","true":true}
