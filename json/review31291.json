Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some character motives did not match with the characters we knew to grow and love. It\u2019s out of character for them. It misses the magic that the prior films had. They could have cut one long scene from the movie completely because it was useless to the plot & focus on other scenes that needed more time. Disappointed. Critic reviews being so high shows how $$ plays a large part in all this. So sad..","true":true}
