Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson claim to be long time SW fans. I call BS. They don't seem to understand how to tell a modern day mythology\\, nor the importance of interconnected themes and relationships in mythology. As clunky as Lucas's directing (and awful dialogue) can be\\, at least he knew how to move the plot forward. So many missed moments. Let the people who write the novels\\, write the animated series\\, and the online theorists come up with the stories. They are far more creative and understanding of what is expected and needed.","true":true}
