Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To make it short:\\n-Many plot holes\\n-Disappointing (or non-existent) character development\\n-Awkward space force float\\n-Choppy and random\\nThis is a tough one\\, since I really did want to like this movie\\, but it just doesn't feel like Star Wars.  It felt like a Marvel\/Disney Star Wars production.","true":true}
