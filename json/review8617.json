Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First star wars ever that I'm not keen to sit through a second time. This movie was a slap in the face to anyone who likes the original trilogy.\\n\\nDoubt if Johnson has even seen a star wars movie (claims he had but clearly doesn't understand it).\\n\\nThe worst part is this is meant to be a trilogy but The Last Jedi doesn't continue any of the plot points from Force Awakens! It's like Johnson just decided he didn't like JJ's movie so he's going in a different direction.\\n\\nBe warned if you were looking for them to answer some of the questions from TFA then you'll be disappointed.\\n\\nCGI and effects are great\\, probably the best the series has ever seen. Director can shoot a scene... just can tell a good story.\\n\\nSo many plot holes and stupid ideas. Doesn't work as a sequel. Too long (never thought I'd say that about a SW movie). Full plot arcs that could have been cut. AND WTF HAVE YOU DONE TO LUKE! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.\\n\\nHands down worst SW movie by Far.\\n\\nAdvise you not to see it\\, wait for netflix.\\n\\nThis is not the Star Wars movie you were looking for. Move along.","true":true}
