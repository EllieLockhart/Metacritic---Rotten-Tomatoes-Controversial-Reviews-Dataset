Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't get you critics loving this film.  yes there are some elements of this film that are understandably pretty cool.  But having Luke go out like that was wrong.  And i am getting sick of Rey being able to do EVERYTHING so perfect.  There's no depth to these characters\\, its just one liners and marketing.  I want star wars films like Rogue One not THIS!!!!!","true":true}
