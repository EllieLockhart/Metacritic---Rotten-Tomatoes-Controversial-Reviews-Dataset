Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly schizophrenic movie. It has the hints of greatness\\, but is weighed down by a padded runtime\\, predictability\\, slapstick humor\\, and superfluous one-dimensional characters whose stories we never get a reason to care about. Like Lukas's in second trilogy\\, cute animals\\, children and slapstick humor is sprinkled everywhere to make the movie more appealing to children and amenable to merchandising. Star Wars\\, Disneyfied.","true":true}
