Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'm on my 2nd playthrough and to be honest\\, I would've rated this much lower if I had only played it once. I really didn't like Abby's part or any of the characters in her story (except Yara and Lev). I can write an entire essay about why Abby's crew is such a stereotypical group (especially Owen) but the point is the disconnect and general displeasure came from them. I like Abby a little better after she's spent some time with Lev but Seattle Day 1-3 with Abby was just not fun for me. It felt like TLOU had these amazingly written morally gray characters then in TLOU2 we get.... Abby's crew. I loved that Joel\\, Tommy\\, and pretty much most of the characters in TLOU knew they were morally gray\\, even Marlene who wanted to save the world. But then we get these Salt Lake City crew who thinks they are always the good guys\\, and that going across the country to torture one guy is justice\\, not simple revnege.Again\\, the 2nd part\\, I really didnt enjoy. A pity too because if I didnt play it again\\, I would've forgotten just how amazing and emotionally inpacting the first part is. The final fight didnt make much sense to me either. Ellie spent months to track and kill Abby and when she's there\\, only then did she get her \\\"peace\\\"? I dont buy it. It feels like part 2 was made for the sole reason of \\\"surprising the players\\\".The worst part for me is the false advertisement. They advertised this as an Ellie centric game. It was not. It felt like Naughty Dog lied to me and I hated it.Hopefully you enjoy this game more than I did. I wont be buying the next one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
