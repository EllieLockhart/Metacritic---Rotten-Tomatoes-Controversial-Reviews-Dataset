Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm such a big Star Wars fan and wanted to love this movie. The scenes with Rey and Luke are absolutely great\\, but the \\\"side quest\\\" of Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rose absolutely killed the movie. Acting was great\\, but man was this some bad writing. There is A LOT of pointless scenes (no spoilers). It was fun only because it was Star Wars and you love the characters. I'm so disappointed.\\n\\nIt's never been more obvious that the critics are somehow being manipulated into high reviews.","true":true}
