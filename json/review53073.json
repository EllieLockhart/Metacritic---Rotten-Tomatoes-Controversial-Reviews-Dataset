Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who has loved Star Wars since I was a kid\\, watched every film tens of times\\, seen every episode of the animated series\\, and put the franchise on an absolute pedestal\\, it would be easy for a new take on the Star Wars universe to let me down\\, but so far\\, this trilogy has gone above and beyond my expectations. The Force Awakens introduced so many deeply complex and lovable characters. It showed us the gray area between dark and light that we hadn\u2019t seen in the original films. Now\\, The Last Jedi takes it all even further. The story progresses thoughtfully and intentionally. Although contradictory to some other reviewers (who may or may not be children)\\, I had no unanswered questions by the end of the film. I was completely satisfied with it as an individual piece. There\u2019s depth here that some might not appreciate\\, but there\u2019s no denying that these movies\\, the characters\\, and their story will be remembered by many people for a long time.","true":true}
