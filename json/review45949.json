Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually attractive but utterly poor and uninteresting story that goes nowhere.  A year on and i still cant quite believe this made it to release. I feeling I had when I left the cinema was of confusion and disappointment. I respect and understand they've got to take the story in new and exciting ways but this was the best they came up with? Add the backlash the studio\\, director and management has shown towards a large portion of the fans that were negatively affected by this film and the damage it has done to Star Wars as a whole could be irreparable. I'm not excited for the next film at all and boy\\, do I love cots...RT\\, I will never regard your critic reviews ever again. The audience reviews are far more credible. We're not complete morons not to see what you're doing.","true":true}
