Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Are the critics getting paid to give this movie an artificially high rating?\\n\\nThis movie is good in isolation. It is not a good Star Wars movie.\\n\\nI have several issues with this film but I will only mention two:\\n\\n#1: I don't buy that Luke tried to kill Kylo Ren because Kylo was being tempted by the Dark Side. Luke faced a similar situation with Darth Vader but always had hope. Luke's character always sees the good in people. And now we are expected to believe that Luke has a completely new personality and new values? And for no apparent reason? It's an insult to his character. \\n\\n#2 I see that Disney is attempting to start over with a whole new set of characters. The Rebellion is reborn with a new group of people that we know very little about. It's an abrupt transition and in my opinion it's awkwardly late in the game to start over. I wanted to walk out of this movie feeling excited for the next one\\, but instead I left feeling tired.\\n\\nHopefully the next one is better...","true":true}
