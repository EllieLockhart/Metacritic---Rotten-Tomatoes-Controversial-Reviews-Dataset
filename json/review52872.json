Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing movie\\, Rian Johnson absolutely nailed the story telling poetically. We got to see more of our characters and the stories behind them. A lot was going on though\\, so might take about 3 times (or more!) to watch to actually let it all sink in. Overall beautiful movie!","true":true}
