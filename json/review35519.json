Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has killed the whole Star Wars series for me from here on out.  The plot is full of holes\\, lame attempts at humor\\, and is yet another one time great thing ruined by political correctness\/SJW nonsense messaging.  Really sad flick\\, and a waste of my money and time.  A bad end (for me) to a series that began as a really uplifting and fun series of stories.","true":true}
