Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the most terrible dumpster fire of the modern age. The main plot and all the subplots are pointless and contrived\\, make no logical sense. The two main characters Rey and Kylo Ren are unlikable characters\\, Finn and Poe are okay\\, if not fools. The writing for Luke and Leia does a huge disservice to there original characters. As a long time fan it saddens me to say I will not be seeing another Star Wars movie produced by Disney. ","true":true}
