Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was a fantastic sequel to Force Awakens...with some major plot twists that no one saw coming.  The overall tone of the film including the humor worked well with the constant action sequences.  I also loved the writing and the addition of new characters (minus Rose).  It was great to see Luke and how he matured as an elder vs the Luke we were first introduced to with A New Hope.  The action scenes were brilliant and exciting - I loved the space battles!  I do wish there were more Praetorian Guard scenes\\, and further development of Snoke's character... but that is what we all assumed\\, so I'm glad we were all thrown off to a more powerful character (mind wise) by the end of the movie.  Honestly\\, if you're a true Star Wars fan\\, there is so much win in this movie.  Yes\\, there were scenes I could do without (flying Leia and Rose)\\, but overall I was very happy with the movie.  Can't wait for future installments!  Take your friends and family and go see it in the big screen!","true":true}
