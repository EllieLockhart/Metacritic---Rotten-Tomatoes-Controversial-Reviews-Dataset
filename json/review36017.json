Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi served as a perfect continuation to The Force Awakens\\, it delivered moments of pure Star Wars magic\\, while also continuing to grow its characters. In the end\\, The Last Jedi is up there with Empire and A New Hope in my ranking.","true":true}
