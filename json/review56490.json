Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first part of the movie went a little slow but laid out a good foundation for things later on. I'm rarely surprised when watching a movie because most are very predictable. Two things surprised me in this film. First was Kylo Ren's actions in the scene with him\\, Rey\\, and Snoke. The second and most impactful was how Luke used the force to battle Kylo Ren in the final scene. \\n\\nSPOILER ALERT: Luke projecting himself across the galaxy to fight Kylo showed the power of the force. A few people I watched the movie with did not notice that Rey has the Jedi books. When she is pulling something out of a drawer on the Millennium Falcon you can see the books in the corner of the drawer. I believe Disney is just opening the franchise to many more opportunities by closing the era of the Skywalker family. It is opening mastery of the Force to the many different types of alien species and people that were Jedi over the entire film series and shifting away from \\\"Force Inheritance.\\\"","true":true}
