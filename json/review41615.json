Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is gorgeously shot\\, well acted\\, and has great sound design and action set pieces\/choreography. \\n\\nUnfortunately\\, most of the characters are either pointless or mistreated. There is an entire plot point with a couple of the lead characters that means nothing\\, Rey once agains feels too powerful without earning it\\, and Leia has one of the most UNBELIEVABLY STUPID moments in all of Star Wars. Totally jumped the shark. Kylo once again shines in the role and his character does get some more development. It doesn't help that the film feels like a slight mash of Empire and Return of the Jedi in the second and third acts. \\n\\nOverall\\, I'm torn. I think its still good\\, but not great.","true":true}
