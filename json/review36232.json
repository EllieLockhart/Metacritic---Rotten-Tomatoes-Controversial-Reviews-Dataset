Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was wonderful! \\n\\nFunny and feelsy. Well written. Well directed. There was a lot going on but it never lost the thread. Questions answered. Great set-up for the next installment. Delves pretty deep into Jedi mysticism. Porgs are OK. It's different but still feel like a solid part of the Star Wars universe. I honestly don't know what people who don't like it are talking about. I loved it.","true":true}
