Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To sum this movie up in one word would be disappointing.  Sure points were entertaining but the end ruined the entire movie.  They way they handled Luke was abysmal.  I followed the carrot on the stick from the Force Awakens for a promise of Luke doing some amazing things\\, and was fooled with this movie.  Also the way Snoke went out like a punk with no backstory was terrible.  After the Force Awakens ended I couldn't wait to see what happened next\\, now after this movie I really don't have any interest.  I won't be going to the theater for any Future Star Wars movies\\, I'll wait until they are on cable.","true":true}
