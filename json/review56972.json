Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever made. Rian Johnson has probably never seen TFA. I do not believe that the man has seen OT.  The movie does not tell anything about the world it is set in and therefore the galaxy just seems so blank with nothing interesting happening in it. New characters are boring or annoying... Rose is the worst character ever written (she is only used as a tool to address current  political topics and agendas)... She uttered the most stupid line (not even anime character would say something like this). The movies also full of technical issues dismissing laws of physics and common sense; like when the fact that shots from the Supremacy have a ballistic curve in space! (there is no curving in space because there is not enough gravity\\, and even if there was\\, they are shooting laser which can be\\, but still only slightly\\, bend only near a giant star - planet does not posses this amount of gravity). And Luke dies which does not need to be commented.\\nBut the worst thing that this movie did is that because of it there is nothing exciting to be looking forward to in the next film... all the good characters are dead\\, Resistance is basically in the state rebellion was at the star of New Hope \\, the new characters are boring and had almost no growth...","true":true}
