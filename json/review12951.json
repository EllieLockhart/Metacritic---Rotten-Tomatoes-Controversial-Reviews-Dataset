Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t think I have ever hated a movie more than this one. It just plain sucks! To call this a Star Wars Movie is an insult to all of the other movies. Episode 7 was ok\\, Rogue one and the Solo movie were surprisingly good but this move is just garbage! What the he!! Disney? Take your leftist propaganda and go ruin a different series!","true":true}
