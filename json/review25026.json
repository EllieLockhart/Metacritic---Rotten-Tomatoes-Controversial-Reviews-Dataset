Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"my second favorite Star Wars film\\, really I don't get why it gets so much \\n hate :( \\, every friend of mine loved it\\, almost anyone I asked liked it \\n yes I AM a star wars nerd\\, and I have read the dark empire and many other comics that take place in the same time as TLJ and are now legends\\, and I still think that TLJ beats them all","true":true}
