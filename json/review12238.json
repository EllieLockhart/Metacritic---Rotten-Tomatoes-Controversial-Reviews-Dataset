Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a huge SW nerd and I tend to forget the story line and the characters in between episodes. I haven't even seen all (but I had seen VII)! I enjoyed Ep VIII because of the deep reflections on power and corruption. I liked the deep insights into the inner core human beings\\, exemplified by Luke and Rey and Kylo. I liked the saber fight in the fantastic red room. And a lot of good humor along the way. As with regards to the fate of Luke\\, I am fine as long as there will be new heroes to admire in the episodes to comes. And it seems there will be some.","true":true}
