Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They keep telling us that the vocal minority are the only ones who hated this movie. That the \\\"vocal minority\\\" is racist and misogynistic because we didnt applaud how great this movie is. Complete cop out and B.S. it's just a bad movie. There is a minority that has put hate on some of the actors. They are just doing their jobs and it's wrong to blame them personally. I echo nearly all of the legitimate criticism  others have mentioned in the audience reviews. I'm not sure what the expert reviewers are seeing in this film. Maybe they are afraid to tell the truth  out of fear of offending the powerful people at Disney and Lucasfilm. They killed the golden goose and there is no saving it short of starting over. People who say they had to stomp on the Skywalker saga to start the next generation of Star Wars are missing  the point. At any time they can create hair new sagas. Old fans would have welcomed new stories on their own merit. Why destroy 40 years of good will and not give the original saga the finish it deserved. 1 star only because they dont count anything less towards  the score. Clean house Disney\\,  especially Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson.","true":true}
