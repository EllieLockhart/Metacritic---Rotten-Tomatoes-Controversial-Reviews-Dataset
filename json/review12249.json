Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot.  I actually wasn't even going to leave a review\\, but after reading page after page of reviews on Rotten Tomatoes\\, I have to wonder if they are skewing the results of what people are rating this movie. \\n\\nThe majority - by a lot- of reviews that I read give this movie less than 2.5 stars.  Yet\\, the audience score does not seem to change despite the overwhelmingly bad reviews.  \\n\\nWe know the critics were bought\\, were you too RT??\\n\\nPS - this movie deserves 0 stars.","true":true}
