This is the stuff i Miss in so Many Story-telling Mediums These days that are brought up in the Mainstream. You cant seem to find truly developed character motivations. To play as Abby after playing Ellie\\, is like a total punch in the face\\, but to see it as a story device and mechanism to round up your view and emotions for the whole mess that is the circle of violence these character create in order t o silence their sorrow\\, is a thing so many people cant seem to understand. Your Choice to Tell such a Story is beyond brave. it created and exceeded this strong emotional bond i built when playing the First Game years ago. I know Its probably Not That easy but Dont be frustrated or sad by all the negative buzz. These are sadly the times we\u2018re live in\\, where Many People cant seem to enjoy and respect other peoples Vision\\, in that case your Vision for the sequel journey... judging and criticing everything That doesnt Go their way. I respect the artistic decisions you made Story-Wise and i believe it wasnt easy. Thank you for this amazing journey! Don\u2019t let the backlash get you down. 10\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
