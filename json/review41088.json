Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had its moments but overall fell flat on its face\\, the force feeding of 1977 type cheesy jokes make it hard to take it remotely seriously. The majority of the important big scenes left you saying to yourself \u201creally that\u2019s what they decided to do here\u201d\\, and the bad writing was capped of with bad acting. Again there were a handful of scenes that were awesome to see on the big screen but weren\u2019t enough to hide all of the problems with this movie. ","true":true}
