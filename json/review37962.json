{"101487":179007,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The short\\, simple version:\\n\\nMy single-point problem with The Last Jedi... As Mark Hamil himself stated\\, I too fundamentally disagree with every decision Rian Johnson made about Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi. The portrayal of Luke in this movie is unforgivable. If it wasn't for this\\, I could let all the other stuff go fairly easily; and reserve judgement until the trilogy is complete. Even after reducing Luke's character to ridiculousness\\, one different decision at the end could have salvaged it for me\\, and the movie as a whole. That didn't happen. They portrayed Luke as a coward throughout the movie\\, concluded it as Luke being a coward\\, and... **SPOLIERS**... he dies. F#@k.\\n\\nThe Longer Version...\\n\\n**SPOLIERS** The Snoke ending is annoying. The narrative against this opinion is that \\\"nobody told the fans to theorize about Snoke\\\"\\, \\\"Nobody told the fans to think Snoke was important or mysterious\\\". To that\\, I say... The f#@k they didn't! Snoke was clearly portrayed in The Force Awakens in such a way to create that precise reaction from the fan base. I think the sheer volume of interest in Snoke since the release of The Force Awakens serves as solid evidence of this. The Snoke mystery didn't come out of nowhere. It's annoying\\, but there could be more to Snoke's story\\, so I'll reserve judgement until Episode IX has dropped.\\n\\nSimilar issue about Rey's lineage. **SPOILERS** I don't mind at all that she's not related to anyone \\\"special\\\" in the universe; specifically a prominent force user. What I reject is the complete lack of explanation for her immense power. If that power doesn't come from strong force lineage\\, fine; but then it must come from sustained and strenuous training at the hand of a master\\, correct? Apparently not. Another thing I reject about this is that it is being somehow considered a new idea in the Star Wars universe\\, yet there were hundreds of Jedi in the old Jedi Order that were obviously not all Skywalkers\\, Kenobis\\, etc. The idea that force sensitives do not need to be related to anyone special is not a new idea in Star Wars canon; not even a new idea in the movie saga. What is new\\, is the concept that immense force power can simply be bestowed upon someone; no lineage\\, no training... it's just there. Once again\\, there could be a deeper story here\\, or misdirection\\, so we'll see. What I will say is that this does not help combat the \\\"Rey is a Mary Sue\\\" argument\\, which is something I defended against after The Force Awakens. I'm not sure how to defend that now.\\n\\nI am a life long Star Wars fan that recognizes the good and bad elements of each film. Up until The Last Jedi\\, I've very happily consumed the majority of what Lucasfilm has offered; from the very beginning\\, throughout the George Lucas years to the present day\\, i.e The Original Trilogy\\, The Prequel Trilogy\\, The Clone Wars Animated Series\\, Star Wars Rebels Animated Series\\, numerous books\\, comics\\, etc. I've been a consistent defender of the Prequel Trilogy; not because I put it on a par with the OT\\, but because I appreciated the back story. Every piece of Canon has offered something to the Star Wars lore for me\\, and while I appreciate an attempt at being different and making some bold moves\\, I didn't appreciate that change coming at the expense of Star Wars lore.\\n\\nLastly\\, another thing I despise is the politicization of my entertainment. Regardless of the politics and whether I agree with those politics or not\\, I don't want politics in Star Wars. It's decisive (of course)\\, dates the film and is sorely out of place.\\n\\nI could get past all the BS\\, plot holes\\, etc. if they didn't totally f@#k up the character of Luke beyond recognition.","true":true}
