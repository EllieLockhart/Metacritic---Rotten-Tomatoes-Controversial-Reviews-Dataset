Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film with spectacle. Incredible cinematography. The story they had to tell shouldn't have taken nearly 2 hours. I understand people can become jaded over time\\, but Luke Skywalker deserved a better sendoff. A proper villain would've been welcome.","true":true}
