Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The last Jedi review (no spoilers):\\nImagine a group of 50 year old Star Wars addicts in a session. Imagine them being told to write down all that they love in the first three movies. Just to let it out. Then imagine that they are really Disney executives. \\nI liked this movie yet... Did I need about 50 old Star Wars references. Did I need about 50 old Star Wars plot twists. Probably not but I did like it. The visual was stunning. The sound was outstanding. The fight scenes were amazing. I thought the humor was good. 7 out of 10. Rouge One was better because I bet the Star Wars addicts were in session and unable to write it.","true":true}
