Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely appalled by the audience reviews.  Stop complaining that the movie did not go the way you wanted it to.  The character development was fantastic\\, for both young and old characters.  If you do not know how Rian Johnson works\\, you need to realize that every little part of the plot was meticulously planned.  Watch the movie\\, focus on the plot\\, and try to see the images and meaning behind all of it rather than getting mad at surface level plot holes.  This movie was genius\\, unlike anything we have seen before.  Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Daisy Ridley's performances were excellent.  Go watch it again\\, fill in the apparent plot holes using actual intelligence and realize the movie's awe-inspiring emotion.","true":true}
