Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan my whole life\\, but this was a tragedy. Legends never die\\, and so the now \\\"Legends\\\" Star Wars is the only universe that exists to me. Words cannot describe the tarnishing that they did to all of the original characters\\, the bastardization of the series to promote political agendas  \/ SJW stuff\\, and the sheer idiocy of having different directors be given free reign on a a trilogy that's supposed to correlate to one another. Horrible decision\\, and it shows! I could write for hours\\, but Mark Hammil's true thoughts about the film shown not only during the filming of (see blu-ray documentary) but in interviews like the one Mark Hamill gave to that French magazine. Apart from his feelings though (which I respect a lot because I respect him as an actor\\, a fan\\, and a person)\\, I had such a sour feeling left\\, and was literally down for more than a month after the film was released. I saw all the other films several times in the theatres. This one\\, once was too much. I can't go back\\, but I can enjoy the originals for what they are forever\\, and just read the books and forget about this disney tragedy. I get taken to see these movies for free and will continue to do so in respect of the people who take me\\, but to enjoy them I will pretend that these are films inspired from Star wars but in a completely different universe. Oh\\, and never buy any of the blu-rays. Disney has lost my support\\, and I am thankful that I have other ways to enjoy Star Wars apart from them. Enough to last me a lifetime...","true":true}
