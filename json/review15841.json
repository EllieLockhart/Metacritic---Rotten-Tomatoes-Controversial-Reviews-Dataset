Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars\\, it is my absolute favorite movie franchise.  To see what happened in this movie to such a beloved galaxy of interesting\\, beautiful\\, and meaningful stories and myths. In just under three hours everything I grew up loving about Star Wars was either 1.thrown away 2.made fun of 3.broken to the point of no return. My only hope is that this won't become a trend\\, having meaningless stories that have no purpose deeper than having pretty CGI sequences.","true":true}
