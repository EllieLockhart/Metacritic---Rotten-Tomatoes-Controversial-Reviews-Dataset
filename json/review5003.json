Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Countless plot holes and cringe worthy moments\\,  several annoying child like jokes with terrible timings \\, lack of respect for the stablished lore\\, legacy characters and veteran fans alike \\, an hour long  boring and inconsequential casino plot with a horrible new character (Rose Tico)\\, the worst part is that not only it alienated me and my friends from ep ix but of star wars as a whole\\, congrats Rian Johnson for ruining star wars by making a poorly written fan fiction canan\\, that apparently only you enjoyed. Good luck with that new trilogy because no one will care about it.","true":true}
