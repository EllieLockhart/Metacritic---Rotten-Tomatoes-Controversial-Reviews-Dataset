Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absolute train wreck of a Star Wars movie which propels its self to a different world of bad\\, how Ryan Johnson got this so wrong is beyond amazing and deserves its own movie. A big F U to the fans\\, community and Star Wars Universe.\\n\\nI have loved Star Wars for 40 years since seeing the original movie in the cinema\\, this movie killed that with its bad story\\, bombers in space\\, plot holes\\, terrible comedy and Luke milking green milk from a tit.\\n\\nIts more like spaceballs 2.\\n\\nMy original toys\\, games\\, books now have no meaning but I will thank Ryan Johnson for saving me money as I will never spend a bean on this franchise again!","true":true}
