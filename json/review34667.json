Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The complete movie is a plot hole. A boring spaceship chase but other characters manages to go to other planets undetected to do nothing really. Snoke is a joke\\, Kylo its just a spoiled child and Ray is a Mary Sue.","true":true}
