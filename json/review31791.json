Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So without spoilers here's my review of Star Wars: the Last Jedi. \\n\\nThe pacing of the movie was great\\, there were a lot of stories going on\\, with new characters introduced with story arcs of their own\\, and yet the movie didn't suffer for so many interwoven stories. In fact this director did a masterful job in weaving everything together and letting everyone shine that we the audience wanted to see shine. Luke's big moment will leave your jaw on the floor. Kylo and Rey are amazing in this movie. Leia had everyone screaming and some weeping and then cheering and more than a few 'holy shit!\\\" were heard. This is the Star Wars that was last seen in The Empire Strikes Back\\, and since then hasn't been felt in such a visceral way. \\n\\nThere are laughs\\, mostly to break the tension (from either heart stopping action\\, or moments of fear or anticipation) so you can truly enjoy it all. \\n\\nThere is one really jarring moment in the movie\\, that takes you out of the story as it clearly doesn't belong in a Star Wars movie anywhere and again without a spoiler: it's a single line delivered by one new character. This character is redeemed though in a truly awe inspiring way that again leaves you sitting in shock for the gravitas the moment is given. \\n\\nThe movie is long\\, but at no time are you wondering when is it going to end\\, instead you're hoping that it won't and when it finally does; it feels like it does so having fulfilled everything you didn't know you wanted to see in a Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson as a director far surpasses anything else put out there by Star Wars since the Empire Strikes Back and I like more than a few people are left wondering now which of these two iconic movies we like more. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens doesn't compare\\, it's a different beast altogether and is a popcorn fluff movie\\, whereas The Last Jedi is a film about people\\, well rounded people\\, with lives\\, goals\\, dreams and flaws who live in a complex yet understandable universe and the film's central story doesn't drown out the individual stories. \\n\\nDisney needs to bring this writer and director back for the next chapter in this trilogy because this is now a story that I want to see told. I want to see where he takes these characters.","true":true}
