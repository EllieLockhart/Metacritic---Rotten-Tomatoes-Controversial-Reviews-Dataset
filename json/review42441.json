Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disgrace to the franchise. Rian didn't understand the context behind anything that happened in the previous movies and therefor couldn't write a single good thing. Mark tried to warn him but they didn't listen. Just a piece of rotten garbage.","true":true}
