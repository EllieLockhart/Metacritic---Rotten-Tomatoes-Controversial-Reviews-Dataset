Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is still around because of the fans of the original trilogy. They are what has made star wars a success. The last Jedi spat in the face of these fans. The star wars universe is immense\\, interesting creation full of mystery\\, action and great characters. This movie gave us none of that. I want to love this movie but I nearly ended up walking out.","true":true}
