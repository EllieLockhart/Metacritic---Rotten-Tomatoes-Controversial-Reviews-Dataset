Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros:\\n- visually great\\n- good soundtrack\\n- kylo hesitating to kill Leia\\n- rey and Kylo communicating through the force\\n- fight scene was cool\\n- Luke's projection was cool\\n- force sensitive kid was cool\\n\\nCons:\\n- chase act is convoluted and boring\\n- Leia's force abilities showcase was poorly done\\n- Holdo is a boring character that I find difficult to like (she almost seems to be presented as an antagonist)\\n- Rose is a boring character that I find difficult to like (her lines and existence in general feel forced)\\n- casino act is convoluted and boring\\n- Luke's character is butchered and made into a joke (Luke doesn't care that Han died?  this is horrible.)\\n- Phasma is killed off without any development\\n- Snoke is killed off without any development\\n- feel as though nothing is at stake\\, makes it difficult to get invested in any character\\n\\n\\nall around very disappointing.  the whole \\\"subverting expectations\\\" strategy heavily backfired.","true":true}
