{"101487":127488,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here goes my almost spoiler free review of Star Wars The Last Jedi.\\n\\nAs a movie it was a great! but as a Star Wars movie it was ok\\, my biggest complaint is that the movie basically changes what Star Wars is\\, it felt more like a guardians of the galaxy or Avengers movie than it did a Star Wars film.\\n\\nThe scenes and CGI are great and action scenes were intense\\, so why am I complaining you may ask? the only way I can compare it to is:\\nimagine if you will\\, marrying a girl from a small town\\, big into church\\, from a conservative family and a year down the road your wife is asking you to attend swing parties\\, down a bottle of rum on one sitting and attend death metal concerts\\, I mean\\, sure\\, the new version is more fun\\, but it is not who you fell in love with\\,too much going on \\,wasted plots that lead nowhere\\, big build ups that ended up in disappointments.\\n\\nToo many plot twists\\, I mean\\, I enjoy a good plot twist\\, like \\\"the Island\\\" with Ewan McGregor\\, or \\\"The others\\\" with Nicole Kidman\\,love to see those curve balls that you did not see coming\\, but Star Wars TLJ has too many of them\\, it is at least 15 plot twists\\, through the movie\\, so it can wear you down a bit\\, it is like the movie is constantly mocking the viewer\\, as if a small boy extended his hand for a hand shake just to pull back in the last minute and laugh\\, over and over and over again\\, it is good the first time\\, not so much after the 10th \\, and that is what this movie feels like\\, like the movie makes fun of the viewer for even trying to guess what is going to happen next.\\n\\nAnother complaint of mine is that I felt like the new movie completely destroyed whatever the last movie was trying to create\\, it is as if someone build a sand castle on the beach and the next guy that was supposed to help build it instead jumps on it and destroys it as he laughs maniacally.\\n\\nNow to the good parts of TLJ:\\n\\nSome Scenes were right down Epic\\,almost beating scenes such as Yoda in episode 2 The Clone Wars\\, and The Destruction of the death star in Episode 4 New Hope\\, there was a lot of wasted opportunities here with Jedi fights but I will leave it at that.\\n\\nThe space battles were good\\, albeit a bit bland\\, not as good the space battles of the originals and the opening scene in Return of the Sith\\, but good non the less.\\n\\nMark Hamill sill has the acting skills\\, Carry Fisher (May she RIP) can not act to save her life\\, Daisy Ridley is a talented actress and does a fine job as a lead character\\, and Vinicio del Toro does a great job as well\\, the rest of the actors were average to say the least\\n\\nFinal rating:\\nAs a movie:8.5 out of 10\\nAs a Star Wars movie: 6.5 out of 10.","true":true}
