Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was way too long. I know it's hard to say that a sci fi fantasy movie is far fetched\\, but I found some of the decisions made in this movie to be so ridiculous that it was hard to stomach. There seemed to be a lot of plot holes and I felt that a lot of the characters were acting inconsistently.","true":true}
