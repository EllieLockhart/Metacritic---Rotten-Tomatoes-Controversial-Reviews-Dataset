Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*spoilers* Why is rose here? They got a fine actor to play a shit character. The movie would have been better if rose didn't save Finn and Rey accepted Kylo's offer. I'm not going to give it half a star because of the yoda scene.","true":true}
