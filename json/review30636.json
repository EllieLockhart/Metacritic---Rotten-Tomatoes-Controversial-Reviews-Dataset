Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put\\, it's a perfect blend of the standard Star Wars fare but with added humour\\, new characters and plenty of action. Without adding spoilers\\, if Star Wars ended here it would be perfect climax to the whole saga. Sadly it'll probably get drawn out into a Rocky episode 317 type scenario and lose its punch... Too much of a cash cow still to end it!\\n\\nBut keeping things to the film in question....amazing....miss it at your peril! ??","true":true}
