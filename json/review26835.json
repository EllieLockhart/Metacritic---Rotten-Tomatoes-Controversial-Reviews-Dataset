Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of my favorite movies about the force and I'm giving it this review because of the sub plots. Totally under cuts the archetypes put forth in the previous movies.  Rose and the purple haired commander are two of my least favorite Star Wars characters ever created.  I think they are worst for the series as a whole than Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
