Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars was the first film  i ever watched at the cinema.  This film betrays the legacy of that film.  Luke skywalker character assasination is a travesty.  SJW themes are just the icing on this rancid cake.  The Star Wars story group and Kathleen Kennedy should be fired for allowing this atrocity.","true":true}
