Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Luke Skywalker even considering such a cowardice act?\\n\\nReally Rian\\, et al.? Hell no!\\n\\nAnd why does Star Wars need to become a platform for serving the political agendas of Disney execs?\\n\\nIf I had to choose one word to describe this pile of mess\\, it would have to be abomination.","true":true}
