Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a warning\\, spoilers ahead. It was a really interesting movie\\, and it really had some twists. It made you think it would go like Empire Strikes Back\\, but then has a drastic change. I also have quite a bit of bias for it\\, due to the return of everyone's favourite force sensitive Muppet. An overall good movie\\, with a perfect sendoff for Luke.","true":true}
