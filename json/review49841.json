Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yet again\\, we are left with protagonists we never truly fear for due to the lack of substantive antagonists worth their salt. Luke's storyline and character were sullied and as muddled as it was\\, remained one of the few redeeming qualities of the film. Lastly\\, as Lonestar and Barf might say\\, \\\" I know we should've put more than five bucks worth in.\\\"","true":true}
