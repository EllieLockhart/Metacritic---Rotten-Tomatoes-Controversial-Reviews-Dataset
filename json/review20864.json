Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was able to see TLJ opening night with 74 members of The 501st\\, Rebel Legion\\, and The Mandalorian Mercs in my local Garrison. One this was an amazing experience in and if itself. Now as far as the movie went. As a die-hard fan I knew going into this movie it wasn't made for me. The original Trilogy was\\, this movie was made for the new fans\\, those who are now the age I was when I saw Star Wars the first time. With that being said I went into this with an open mind and I really enjoyed the movie. While some of the jokes seemed forced (no pun intended) the movie as a whole had more good parts than bad. While DelToro's character DJ was a complete waste and that entire scene could have been removed and done differently\\, and Leia Mary Poppins scene should have been rewritten\\, the move was still very solid in my book. I have watched it twice now and have enjoyed different things each time. While this movie is not a masterpiece\\, I still believe it will be a nice addition to the franchise.","true":true}
