Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great entry to the legendary saga. The cast was great. Mark Hamill has one of his best performances as Luke Skywalker. Other highlights include Adam Driver and the late Carrie Fisher. The story was captivating. It takes so many exciting and unexpected turns. I was in awe of Rian Johnson\u2019s directing. The film was also visually stunning. The film does have some flaws. I can\u2019t really explain them without spoiling the film. They are about a certain plot line and something in the ending. Overall\\, this is a thrilling film that has me curious and excited for what\u2019s to come. ","true":true}
