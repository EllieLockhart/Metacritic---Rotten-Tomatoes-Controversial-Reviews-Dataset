Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"last jedi makes the lousy prequels look like masterpieces...also the head of Rotten Tomatoes said that the audience score which is currently in the 50% range is legit\\, not created by some computer hack.... I think Kathleen \\\"the force is female\\\" Kennedy found a wuss male director that would agree to anything she wanted\\, including making the male characters cowards and morons\\,\u00a0 while the female characters can do no wrong...Mark Hamill has said repeatedly that he was at odds with the director re this is not how Luke Skywalker would act...thx Rian Johnson\\, fxxxxn pxxxy!!!!","true":true}
