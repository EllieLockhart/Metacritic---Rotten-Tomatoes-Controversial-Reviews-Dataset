Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really excited after consensus great reviews.  However\\, this movie was a complete dud.  Disney is ruining all my childhood heroes and collecting billions of dollars to do it.  Running time was way too long.  So much of the movie just seemed overly contrived and far fetched.  Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher were great with the limited material they were afforded.  Save your money\\, wait for it on Netflix.  Summation\\, notch above Star Wars prequels\\, but not by much. Awful.","true":true}
