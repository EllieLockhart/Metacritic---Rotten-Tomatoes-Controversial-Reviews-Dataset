Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow that was almost painful to get thru. I liked the final 1\/3 of it but wow\\, everything set up and developed in The Force Awakens (which I loved) was discarded and story lines dropped flat. The addition of Rose was just weird and just could not take her seriously. The constant political correctness\\, the overplayed girl power\\, and the ridiculous and out of character humor just added to its downfall for me.Must say Im extremely disappointed. so much potential that just got unraveled by Rian Johnson and Disney. I have been a fab since a new hope opened in the late 70's... and this is the first movie in the saga that has ended it for me... what happens next... who cares","true":true}
