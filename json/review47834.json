{"101487":196304,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin\\,\\nThe entire plot of The Last Jedi was just a modern corporate \\\"set piece\\\" showcase that made up \\\"cool scenes\\\" and wrote a story around them instead of creating a plot that could generate excitement through its narrative.\\nRey is a terrible character not because she is a powerful competent woman but because she is a generic paint by numbers \\\"insert here\\\" protagonist meant to be as inoffensive as possible so no marketing demographic could find her unlikeable while nothing she does holds any consequences. She maintains her \\\"Mary Sue\\\" qualities presented in the previous instalment\\, but whether you're an apologist for this or believe that there is no right way to make the \\\"infallible heroine\\\" trope workable or enjoyable\\, Disney was certainly not able to do so with their lazy but safe formula as described above. \\nFin had a good story arc in the Force Awakens. Shame then that he forgets it all between that movie and this and has to repeat it all again\\, making his character pointless. \\nCanto Bright was a waste of 30 minutes.\\nHoldo was created backwards\\, in that she is a walking plot device whose derived decisions only stem from a need for others to take action. Where they wanted Poe to learn a lesson about not being a \\\"hot head\\\" they instead keep him from doing anything wrong so the audience can't have a reason to dislike him(and not buy his merchandise). therefore they make Haldo nonsensical and contradictory because she is only a plot device and not a character participating with any logical agency in the story. \\nHyperspace ramming\\, as elaborated elsewhere in cannon\\, has invalidated the entire franchise. \\nLuke's character development from the original trilogy is erased entirely\\, all for the cliche \\\"fed up with life master learns to love life again because of his new apprentice\\\". Then he's killed off from thinking too hard because Rey doesn't actually need a master... see the Mary Sue bit above. \\nEverything about The First Order operates illogically. They amassed a massive fleet and arsenal of super weapons the size of the empire's with out any of the means of the empire to do so in a fraction of the established time frame it took the empire. Then the galaxy\\, without so much of a shrug\\, let's them assume dominion because they destroyed one system with a weapon they lost to 4 insurgents. They were not only shown to be a threat to every living beings' existence but also entirely defeatable. But with the exception of the pre-established rebelio-I mean resistance\\, no one\\, no single outlying system or people\\, want to push back against this shamelessly generic space metaphor of Nazism that has the villainous credibility of a Will Ferrell character. The Empire was well represented in how they ruled and controlled the galaxy even in A New Hope. The first order has no other characterization beyond \\\"member the empire!?\\\"\\nSnoke is stupid. The Emperor worked as a mysterious ultimate villain because viewers were bran new to the universe of starwars from the first time the character is ever mentioned. The minimal amount of exposition he received over the course of three movies served to enhance Vader and the empire because it stands to reason that as viewers learn more about the universe\\, they come to learn more about off screen and minimally screened power players to the story. But in the new movies\\, there have been 6 movies\\, 3 TV series and thousands of books about this universe. Just throwing in a more powerful entity similar to the emperor to hold his place as the ultimate evil for the story makes no sense. It's contradictory to everything that has already been established and requires reasonable explanation. The fact that Luke and Leia keep referring to Snoke by name as the big bad guy and for others like Rey who has no exposition to the bad guy on or implied off screen to not ask about him is disconcerting\\, unnatural\\, and entirely reality breaking.\\nBad designs. The costumes are bland and generic. in the original trilogy everyone\\, from just the rebel commandos to Han Solo had a definitive silhouette and an iconic and unmistakable look. This is one thing that keeps the prequels and the originals so clearly linked is comprehensive character design that is unmistakably starwars. The new trilogy fails so miserably in this that they could reuse even main character outfits in another movie in the Disney conglomerate and no one would notice because it is all so generic and bland. Yet on the flip side\\, their design of the new space craft is so simplistically unoriginal that it is an eye sore. Make the B-wing a fat slow bomber\\, make the X-wing more sporty and stealthy. Take an original design and just junk it up a touch\\, or make it slicker. Again\\, this wouldn't be such a big complaint if the prequel trilogy had not already established that you can make purely original designs\\, and even obviously antiderivative ones feel original\\, and keep the authentic feel of  thematic similarity. \\nLastly\\, I don't know if anyone has read this at all or this far but I do promise this is going to be it. The Last Jedi recants everything that has happened since A New Hope. It has been about 35 years in-universe and everything has been reset to the exact same point as it all was in A New Hope. Evil Empire with a dark master controlling it all\\, ragtag group of Rebels (they shamelessly change their name in the last part of the movie)\\, Young Jedi with the bare minimum training to use the Force to move the story along and uphold a legacy that has been otherwise wiped out\\, and so on. The original trilogy might as well have never happened because everything as been reset to a timeless\\, merchandise friendly limbo. This soulless state of affairs for the Disney bought universe does not bode well for the next installment\\, or anything Disney has planned to tag their new favorite trademark to each and every year till 2030. The novelty of starwars will not be saving the franchise from bad writing\\, uninspired direction\\, and absolutely terrible production much longer.","true":true}
