Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"shockingly bad\\, from the very start. the rebellion so mired by superficial 'infighting' that barely anything is 'gained'. Low brow comedic garbage makes established characters unrecognizable.. The First Order's General Hux is reduced to a bumbling fool. The previously brave\\, and selfless Poe reduced to a hot-head liability\\, who's greatest achievement is a \\\"yo mama\\\" joke. No one to root for. Just a hodge podge of individuals with no cohesive direction. learn from the past USED to be the motto of THE WISE... KILL the PAST ?  sounds like a bad teenage punk rock band","true":true}
