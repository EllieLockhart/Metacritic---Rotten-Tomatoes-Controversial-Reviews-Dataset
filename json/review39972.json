Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is he second best Star Wars move (Empire Strikes back is first). There are so many good \u201chints\u201d in this movie\\, that I think people giving it a bad review must have missed them.","true":true}
