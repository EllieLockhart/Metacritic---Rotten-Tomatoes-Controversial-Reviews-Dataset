Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Re-submitted with one star as apparently 1\/2 star reviews don't count on the audience score:\\n\\nThis Last Jedi is awful in so many ways\\, as a Star Wars movie it is more of a parody\\, as a stand alone movie it's just eye candy.\\n\\nThe downfall of this movie is that it was NOT made for fans of Star Wars. It was made to please a mainstream audience\\, it's like a Marvel\/DC action movie in a Star Wars skin. The story\/plot is secondary\\, instead we have a stunning visual spectacle\\, that will dazzle the audience in the theatre\\, but ultimately this movie will have no longevity.  \\n\\nLazy writing\/screenplay\\, multiple scenes plagiarised from previous movies\\, the plot is riddled with holes and inconsistencies. Political propaganda\\, appalling poor\/forced humour EVERY 5 MINUTES\\, references to christian religion & swearing.This is NOT Star Wars.\\n\\nThis new direction may work in a stand alone Star Wars movie\\, Rian Johnson said he wanted to \\\"wipe the slate clean\\\"\\, very well\\, do it in a spin off. Unfortunately what we have now is part 8 of a saga that's completely incoherent with everything that came before. \\n\\nHow have Lucasfilm\/Disney got it so wrong after Rogue One and TFA.","true":true}
