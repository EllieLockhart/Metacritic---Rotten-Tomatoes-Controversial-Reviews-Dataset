Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much talk of it being a divisive film. and whether you love it or hate it\\, that fact is certainly true. \\n\\nWhile (and seemingly even more so in this day and age)\\, you can't please all of the people all of the time\\, perhaps there is something to be said for at least having a punt at it. \\n\\nThis film was always going to split audiences and fans down the middle after the direction and choices were made to take the story the way that it has now gone\\, and although there are aspects of it that are certainly well polished and do invoke elements of the original saga that it owes its creation to\\, ultimately it has done something for me which even the prequels could not... It has finally ended my childhood love affair for the Star Wars saga. \\n\\nI can completely understand why many love this latest episode\\, and I am not going to bad mouth it for the various reasons that many others have\\, I will simply say that it has lost its magic and wonder on a very personal level for me individually. \\n\\nI will always hold the originals in that special place we keep safe for things that affect the fabric of yourself\\, and I am sure that among the slew of future releases\\, there will be something in there that I enjoy\\, but I think the future will leave me regarding these as simply; slickly made\\, modern\\, sci-fi flicks\\, that for are now\\, nothing more\\, and nothing less to me than exactly that\\, rather than the rip-roaring space opera that a long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away meant something so very special to me and many\\, many others. \\n\\nI genuinely hope that the new films bring that same enjoyment to a new generation as the OT did for mine\\, and without any bitterness\\, hope that they also have the opportunity to see them concluded in a way that they would like to see their own heroes walk off into the sunset. \\n\\nI can't stress enough that I am glad that for so many this was something special\\, but can't help but ponder how the original Star Wars would be thought of 40 years later if only half of the viewers were at all amused.\\n\\nStar Wars never belonged to me\\, I have no right complaining about the directions that characters now take and how new plots unfold\\, as it was never my property to play with\\, but there was a certain magic in those films that connected with me\\, and which now seems crucially missing. I have gotten older as have the earlier films and so to has the world in general so I guess\\, maybe\\, it is long past time to pass on that particular torch\\, and if that was the ultimate goal of The Last Jedi\\, it has been wholly successful. I wish the films\\, the story and the future fans all the best\\, but this is no longer a journey that I will be accompanying them with.","true":true}
