Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucks!\\, save your money!\\, I want my money back. I am so sad and disappointed when I left the theatre. I can not believe how they destroyed our beloved Luke Skywalker!. He was not a Master Jedi Knight he was a coward! In this film. Whom ever that was involved in making this film shame on you!. I will move on to Marvel movies now and this will be the last Star Wars for me!. Yes you have lost a long time fan. The new generation of Star Wars has no chemistry or movie magic it will be a bust. Luke\\, leia\\, and Han with chewbacca that is MAGIC. Good bye","true":true}
