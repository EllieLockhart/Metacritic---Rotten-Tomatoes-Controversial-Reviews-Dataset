Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible showing of how disney doesn't care for the franchise they acquired and just wants to squeeze money from it. From the horrible merchandise chickens\\, passing by the unrecognizable Luke\\, the inconsecuential Finn\\, the incredibly boring Rose\\, the meaningless Snoke and the fanboy friendly death of useless Phasma (showing Brienne's eye\\, so you can know its her)\\, for me\\, Star Wars dies with this movie. Episode 7 was bad\\, but this is a plain joke.","true":true}
