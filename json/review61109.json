We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I had no issue with the LGBQT+ characters in the game\\, I actually think it\u2019s a great idea and wish there were more characters like this in games. But not even the great graphics and game play could save this game for me. The story was messy\\, poorly planned and executed. Fans of the original were spat on in an attempt to impress critics\\, when critics are not the ones who love the game and pour money into naught dogs pockets\\, fans who purchase the books\\, clothes and all other merchandise were attacked by the writers of Tlou 2 in pursuit of acclaim from people not apart of the wider fan base\\, I can\u2019t stress that enough. Crowbarring Abbys narrative down our throats with out ultimately giving the player the choice to forgive or not\\, then forcing us to watch our beloved heroin who did not start the events that lead to her wanting revenge\\, broken and mutilated while Abby who is the instigator and murder rides off into the sunset with a friend and a new purpose. Saving a little trans boy (which I have not problem with and think the inclusion of is fantastic) does not excuse the fact that she murdered a man in cold blood with a golf club. We loved Joel nothing Abby does can change that and her story was always going to be total trash no matter what\\, she could of been a good character\\, but the ways she was included and written was doomed to fail. You don\u2019t watch lord of the rings and cheer for the orcs\\, did they learn nothing from the game of thrones finale. Fans don\u2019t want the moral garbage they handed us in TLOU 2 we wanted to see the story of the characters we love not ransoms who come in at the last minute. I mean you only play as Abby for the second part of the game! We have already played played an entire Joel and half a game as Abby Joel did what he did for love Abby blind revenge and she herself admitted to murdering people in Boston I\u2019m sure they had families too. The story was just frustrating and ultimately the characters we love we spat on. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth after playing this. Thank you Neil Druckmann for trying so hard to impress people who don\u2019t love the first game you created\u2026 Expand","true":true}
