Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shithouse movie\\, one of the worst in the long illustrious history if the franchise. Disney have fucked up hugely\\, the key questions were barely addressed from episode 7 and Johnson is in trouble to produce a credible plot for episode 9 . Very good as an overall film buy poor for a contextual series film.","true":true}
