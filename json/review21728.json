Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just as soulless as episode 7\\, but without the decency to pander to the audience. It spits at you\\, teasing you for caring. Every serious moment is shattered by out-of-place and unfunny humor\\, the plot falls to pieces under slight inspection\\, and the characters barely progress. All setup from episode 7 is subverted to no end\\, and we are left with little to anticipate for the next installment.\\nThe shiny effects and flashing lights are pleasant enough.","true":true}
