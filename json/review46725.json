Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"we have a movie  that is visually stunning \\,some parts were not bad but if however most of the movie was filled with beyond belief moments that are lazy at best for story telling. Star Wars is legendary but lack of a plot in this movie and the complete and utter disrespect that is shown for Star Wars legends like Luke and Leia just speaks mountains. I will not watch this movie again and cant wait til JJ is back directing .","true":true}
