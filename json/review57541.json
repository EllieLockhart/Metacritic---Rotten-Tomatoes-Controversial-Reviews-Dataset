Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was far and away the worst starwars movie ever made. For reasons you can read about pretty much anywhere\\, it completely ruined starwars for many people\\, from killing luke to pointless sidestories that were shoehorned in to the detriment of plots like snoke\\, to political activism....in a star wars movie of all places. Give me a break. Star wars fans deserved better\\, the critics are so wrong on this one\\, hard to believe they weren't paid to write good reviews.","true":true}
