Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this addition to the series! It showed how flawed the characters we love can be- while still giving them a place we can all root for!  We didn't get answers for all the questions the previous addition to the series posed\\, however\\, there is one more movie left and I applaud the gritty\\, rough-and-tumble edge this movie had. 5\/5","true":true}
