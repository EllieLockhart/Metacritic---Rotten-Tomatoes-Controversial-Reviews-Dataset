Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the low rating. I am a longtime Star Wars fan and was not disappointed  at all with this movie. I thought the ending was awesome\\, the characters were awesome. It gets even better with repeated viewings. The soundtrack is amazing. John Williams weaves the old themes with a few new ones masterfully. I have seen it 4 times and will likely see it again while it is still in the theater. Please don't think all star wars fans hate this movie\\, because this one loves it. My 18 year old son likes it even more than I do!","true":true}
