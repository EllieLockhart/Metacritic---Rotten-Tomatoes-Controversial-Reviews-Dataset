Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty terrible in terms of narrative structure and the overall execution of the film's attempts to deviate from Star wars themes and original canon\\, the acting for a lot of the characters often feels forced\\, cheesy and stale\\, as well as some scenes that were probably meant to be taken seriously I found hilarious\\, and I'm not even going  to try and go into detail about the various potholes in the movie\\, it was just very all over the place and disorganised it's path\\, and I can't say Any of the messages it was trying to convey ever really made themselves apparent or made a huge impact on me\\, overall it was just kind of a meh movie\\, and I wouldn't really reccomend it I'm afraid.","true":true}
