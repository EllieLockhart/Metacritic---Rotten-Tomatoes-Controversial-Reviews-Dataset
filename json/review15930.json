Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ilver Star Wars box sets were the crown jewels of my middle school video collection. After three underwhelming prequels\\, a disappointing sequel\\, and digital remasters that have essentially scrubbed the original versions of the trilogy from the Star Wars library\\, The Last Jedi is the great new Star Wars movie that has finally made me feel excited about the franchise again.\\nhttps:\/\/flatcircleblog.com\/the-force-finally-awakens-in-the-last-jedi\/","true":true}
