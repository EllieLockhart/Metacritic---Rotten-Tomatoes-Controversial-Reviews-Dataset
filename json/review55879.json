Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointing entry in the saga. I left the theatre in a frustrated silence. It's too bad\\, because many things in the movie were quite well done. I loved all the scenes with Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo\\, and think they made a lot of smart choices around their characters and around the mythology around the Force. Luke's life on Ireland with the fish-nuns was fun. The rest of the movie was a slog. Clunky\\, witless dialogue. Repetitive and tedious story beats. And just a really dumb plot. One thing after another in the movie was either dumb\\, boring\\, or just annoying. When we get to the part where some giant rabbits are released to stomp over a bunch of meanies clutching gold coins in their hands\\, it started to feel like this was a script written by eight-year-olds.","true":true}
