Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, while trying very hard to carry on the tradition of the beloved Star Wars legacy\\, just plain fails. I adore Star Wars and I understand the need for commercial additions to appeal to wider audiences and make money. With that being said\\, this movie fundamentally fails on delivering or building on the foundation set by The Force Awakens. This is a true tragedy.","true":true}
