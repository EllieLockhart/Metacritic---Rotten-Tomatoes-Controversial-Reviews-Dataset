Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every single piece of story that has been opened up in Episode 7 has been thrown into the trash with nothing left for a good finale. Dumb slapstick comedy and stupid jokes a la Yo mama\\\" and horrible scenes like Leias Space Float make this Star Wars the worst since Episode 2. Every single fan theory would have brought more to the story than this. 2 and a half hours of nothingness storywise. The only thing that actually happened was the death of two main\\\" characters.","true":true}
