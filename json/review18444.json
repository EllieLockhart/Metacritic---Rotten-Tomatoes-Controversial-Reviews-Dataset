Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is evident that the \\\"new\\\" Star Wars franchise is trying to separate itself from past movies\/storylines. This is not to say that The Last Jedi is a bad movie\\, just that the direction of the franchise has changed. This \\\"change\\\" appears to be an attempt to captivate a new audience and generation. Diehard Star Wars fans may disapprove of the new direction of The Last Jedi\\, because of increased humor\\, new terms\\, conflicting character development\\, and unanswered questions that The Last Jedi failed to answer. However\\, the bottom line is that the Last Jedi is a solid stand alone movie\\, but also appears to be an attempt to engage a younger generation and represents a shift from the past franchise.","true":true}
