{"101487":190219,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"True\\\" Star Wars fans may have blind love\\, but as a generic moviegoer\\, Last Jedi wasn't that good of a movie. There were pointless and illogical plot elements (code breaker wasn't needed in the end\\, old-peoples-speed-chase between Snoke's and the rebel ship)\\, many scenes with over-acting (looking at you\\, Poe-BB8 reunion)\\, MCU-style jokes that didn't fit a Star Wars movie's tone\\, and many payoffs that ended up being very underwhelming (Snoke was just some generic villian\\, for example). Another big issue is that there wasn't much 3D to enjoy\\, I felt ripped off for paying for 3D. The Infinity War trailer was shown at the beginning and that had amazing 3D. Whatever Star Wars 9 is gonna be\\, I have 0 reasons to go watch it after seeing Last Jedi.","true":true}
