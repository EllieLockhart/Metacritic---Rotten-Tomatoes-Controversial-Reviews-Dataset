Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is good on itself\\, adding not only a new tiwst in the original story but also starting to plot on itself getting rid of old and dear characters whose time was already going off TBH. I adore the fact that we have so much diversity in this movie and that characters work themselves through the movie so seamlessly that one doesn't even notice that until the movie is over. Cheers to the fact that we will evidently have Star Wars for many years to come as the franchise is reinventing itself!","true":true}
