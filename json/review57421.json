Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awesome. Long but absolutely incredible.  I can't imagine the next episode being able to top this one . This may become my favorite Star Wars ever. I'm a huge fan I h ave seen every movie 100s of times. This one is certainly different from the others and daring \\, but I think it was done with brilliance. I can't wait to see it again. Thank you for a great movie night . Wow wow and wow","true":true}
