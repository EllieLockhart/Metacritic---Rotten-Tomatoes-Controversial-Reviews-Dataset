Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved how different this movie was! The over-arching theme of the folly of ego and learning from failures was interesting and made it so that I had no way of expecting what was going to happen next. The brash scoundrel doesn't always win??? Craziness. I loved it. It showed that even the heroes can mess up sometimes\\, even Luke\\, because they are all just human. Or alien. You know what I mean.","true":true}
