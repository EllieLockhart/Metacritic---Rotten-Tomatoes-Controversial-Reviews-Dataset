Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So weird that the critics give it a great rating. People seem to either love or hate it. I'm the later firstly the humor as dumb and didn't feel right. Also lots of hokey crap  e.g. Leia flying through the air. Also answered like no questions: Snoke\/Rey","true":true}
