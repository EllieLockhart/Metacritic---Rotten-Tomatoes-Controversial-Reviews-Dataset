Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of action but many questions raised in the Force Awakens aren't answered.  There is a rediculous scene with Leia drifting in space and some plotlines that spend 90 minutes going nowhere. Most disturbing was the destruction of Luke's role as inspirational hero. The franchise seems to have gone over to the dark side.","true":true}
