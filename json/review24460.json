Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More than anything else\\, I feel sorry for all the actors in this film\\, that they had to be exploited as tokens for reprehensible film with poor writing\\, political posturing and an inability to take me to a galaxy far\\, far away. Give Star Wars back to the fans\\, because the current exercise in futility is a complete money pit.","true":true}
