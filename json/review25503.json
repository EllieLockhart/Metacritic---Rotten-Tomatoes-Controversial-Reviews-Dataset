Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers but man I was in shock\\, so much to process. Definitely the most unpredictable Star Wars film out of the entire bunch. Some shocking revelations\\, lots of humor that's hit and miss with me but plenty of dramatic twists that will either leave some upset or amazed. Doesn't have the musical impact of Empire so not the greatest Star Wars film ever but it is its equal for delivering a middle act where you have no idea what's going to follow after so many unforeseen events. Needs to be seen at least twice to take everything in but very bold and very epic. Feels like 1980 all over again\\, we all came out of Empire feeling WTF and where the hell do they go from here?","true":true}
