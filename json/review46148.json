Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visucally\\, probably the best looking star wars movie. Plot-wise\\, without a doubt\\, the absolute worst steaming pile of shit ive ever seen. this thing makes phantom menace look like shakespeare. There are so many things about this film that range from horrible to total garbage\\, that i dont know where to begin. lets just say that rian johnson and kathleen kennedy have effectively killed the star wars franchise. The only hope star wars has now is if disney fires both of them and promotes dave filoni to have of creative at lucasfilm. he's the only one that has the talent and ability to turn things around.","true":true}
