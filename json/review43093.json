Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie...wow\\, where do I even start? First of all\\, the CGI and scenery were gorgeous\\, everything felt like a living and breathing world\\, a world where anyone could think that it's something real\\, something possible\\, something...magical\\, I dare to say. \\nBut\\, a movie isn't good by it's CGI\\, or props\\, or anything like that\\, a movie's good because of the story\\, the essence. And boy\\, this movie shoke the Star Wars fanbase\\, with unexpected turns\\,jawdropping plotpoints\\, and wonderful interactions by these characters\\, but not everything is perfect. There are some plotpoints which\\, in my opinion\\, are pretty stupid\\, and I think Rian Johnson would've done a better job had he gone another route\\, but overall I felt pretty satisfied and I can't wait to see what's in store for Episode IX.","true":true}
