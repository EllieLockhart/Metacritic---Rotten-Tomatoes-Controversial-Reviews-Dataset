Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was done masterfully.  It didn't force its morals down our throats while still making them clear.  Its message was NOT that violence was bad.  At least\\, that's not what I walked away feeling.  I walked away with the sense that violence was pointless.  Through all the killing from both sides in the game\\, nothing was accomplished and no one felt like \\\"The good guy\\\" anymore.  Of course as Naughty Dog has made us expect\\, the graphics and sound design were top notch.  Many people are criticizing the way a beloved character was taken from us early.  This is a real world where things happen realistically and painfully\\, and while it hurt us to see\\, it was a great driving\\, motivating force to play.  This game got across every message and every point it wanted to exactly how it wanted to.  If people are so blinded by what they think the game is about\\, that they want a different ending\\, that's their fault This is a story about Ellie.  About what Ellie feels and does\\, and she goes through so much\\, and sees so much\\, and makes the decision many of us would.  Get over it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
