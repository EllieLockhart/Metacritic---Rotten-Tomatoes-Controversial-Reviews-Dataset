Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So unexpectedly awful. Everything starts and ends with script and this one seemed to be written by the execs themselves giving us the worst lines even for a Disney movie. Not to mention how poorly shot it was. Really disappointed. But to be honest it seems like Disney made this for the children but it\u2019s sad that the folks who grew with star wars have to let this franchise go if they continue in this direction.
