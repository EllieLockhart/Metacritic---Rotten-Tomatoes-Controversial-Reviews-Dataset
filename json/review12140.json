Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan. With the tremendous amount of hype this movie got\\,  I was so pumped to see it then the opening scene starts out with a joke. Are you kidding me? And it all goes downhill from there. This film had no stakes. No sacrifice. No nothing. Plot holes galore. Too many subplots. Too much humor that doesnt work. The movie couldnt make up its mind what it wanted to be. I see why Mark Hamill didnt like the way Luke Skywalker was written. I didnt like it either. This didnt feel like a Star Wars movie.  No expansion of characters. Plus this movie was too long. Maybe if J.J. Abrams had written & directed The Last Jedi it wouldve been a better film. Not this farce that Disney has put out.\\nSome people wanna say its good because its a Star Wars movie. But its not. The Last Jedi had no emotion because it was to busy trying to be funny and treating certain characters like crap. Its nothing more than a confused mess. This is worst Star Wars movie. Got Milk?","true":true}
