Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is fundamentally a character driven story line.  Unfortunately 2\/3's of the characters in this movie were under developed or were burdened with weak character \\\"payoffs\\\".  It was a bold movie\\, but failed (for me) under this element","true":true}
