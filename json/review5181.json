Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Disney\\, didn\u2019t realize when you made the tag line \u201clet the past die\\, kill it if you have to\u201d you were talking to every long time fan\\, because you killed my childhood fantasies about what would happen next in the saga. Shame on you Disney\\, and I feel sorry for Rian Johnson because his name is attached to this piece of crap\\, and I\u2019m sure Disney was being the scenes calling the shots! I\u2019m leaving this island unlike Luke!","true":true}
