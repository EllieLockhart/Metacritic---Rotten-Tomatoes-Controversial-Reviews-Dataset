Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"rey is op\\, finn needs more screen time\\, rey has no ark and u cant connect with her\\, i want rey to fail or at least join the dark side or DIE tho the actor of rey was amazing! it was the script\\, and there was a bunch more thats BS and a lot of star wars fan would agree with me. the critics loved it but true star wars fans hated it its mostly just bad tho i kinda like the movie ... a bit","true":true}
