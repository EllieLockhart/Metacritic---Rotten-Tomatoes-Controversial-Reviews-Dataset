Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning movie with interesting character developement and story telling. The Last Jedi keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time and makes you very excited for what may come next in episode IX.","true":true}
