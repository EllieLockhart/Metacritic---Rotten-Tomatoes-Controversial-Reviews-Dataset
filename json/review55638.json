Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not too bad to watch by itself\\, but so disappointing as part of a trilogy.  Spoiler alert Who are Rey's parents and her history? No ones who dumped her.  Poe Dameron can't get it right.  Finn could be inspirational\\, but no.  Apparently even when he is going to sacrifice himself to save the rest of the resistance (which had just been done by another character and was treated as noble) he was stopped by Rose because \\\"we will win by fighting for what we love\\\"\\, stopped about 30ft in front of the first orders line and for some reason no one kills them.  I thought killing Finn off was wasteful\\, but to me\\, this is worse.  Decent job with Rey.  Snoke is an underdeveloped joke.  Kylo Ren remains an overgrown toddler.  Leia suddenly uses the force to save herself\\, which is sort of ok\\, almost.  Luke sends a\\, well\\, we'll call it a force projection and apparently the strain kills him.  So many questions answered in such a simplistic and unsatisfying way.  Character development\\, what's that?  Casino scene\\, why\\, I am not sure.  Not a fan of this director or this film.","true":true}
