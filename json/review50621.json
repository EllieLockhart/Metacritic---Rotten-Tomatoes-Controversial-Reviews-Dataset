Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"4.3 Stars out of 5 Stars.                                                                          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStar Wars:The Last Jedi was.....................................................................Actually really good.Not Perfect\\,has some flaws\\,but overall it's pretty good.\\nPros\\n-The Acting was Great(Overall)\\n-Story(for the most part) is good\\n-Best Performance(Adam Driver).Kylo Ren is better here than in the Force Awakens and his character arch has been set up so well.Can't wait to see what Kylo does in Episode 9.\\n-The Fight Sequences are visually stunning and some of the best in the whole series.\\n-Special Effects are Top Notch\\n-Plot Twists(Most are good)\\n-BB-8 was Awesome in this movie!\\n-The Porgs are actually cute\\,and funny\\n-Good Humor in the Movie\\nCons\\n-Finn's Character Arch\\n- Second Act of Movie can drag a little(mostly due to Finn's part of the story in this movie) \\n-There's one Plot Twist that was....\\n-Some answers are answered and some are still unanswered\\n\\nOverall I give Star Wars:The Last Jedi ( 4.3\/5 Stars)","true":true}
