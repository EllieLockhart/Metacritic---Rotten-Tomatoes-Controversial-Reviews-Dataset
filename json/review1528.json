Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of all star wars films\\, this one disappointed me. It is not the worst of the star wars films (Attack of the Clones holds that record) but the story seemed to lack expansion like all the other Star Wars films. The entire story really being confined to one ship with a few scenes switching between some new planets did not feel right. Also\\, Carrie Fishers scene floating in space was one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in Star Wars film. But I loved the character development in this film\\, I thought some heavy focus on Poe was much needed for fans and even some clarity and development on Kylo and Rey's relationship. This felt like more of a filler movie than an addition to Star Wars and this is leading up to something massive. So I have a New Hope (pun intended)  for episode 9.","true":true}
