Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was an amazing addition to the sequel trilogy. Rian wasn't joking when he said that it was going to be darker. It was fantastic. I left the cinema with my heart beating out of my chest. Luke's arc was great. He was a broken man full of regret who redeemed himself in the end. Adam Driver played a conflicted\\, tormented villain who seems very close to the edge of redemption. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren was an interesting choice that paid off nicely\\, and I'm very curious to see where this is taken in IX. Finn and Rose's partnership was refreshing and humorous. Rose Tico became one of my favourites in the new trilogy. It's a shame that the audience score is so low because we all know that it's just salty fans who had to say goodbye to Luke. The critics are definitely more on top of this film than the fans. I hope in time that fans will realise what a fantastic story Rian had created that was beautifully written\\, acted\\, and filmed.","true":true}
