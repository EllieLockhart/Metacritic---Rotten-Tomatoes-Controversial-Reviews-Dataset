Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've come to love Star Wars films\\, particularly because of the narrative depth hidden in them (some more than others).  What an absolute pleasure it was\\, then\\, to find The Last Jedi only adding to thematic complexity and thoughtful character development of this space saga.  Even better\\, the film is only enhanced upon multiple viewings.  I hope people come to appreciate this film more as time goes on; it really is quite special.","true":true}
