Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the serious moments are undercut by Marvel style humor. Characters aren't true to their previously established characters. Massive holes are drilled into the canon. Answers no questions from The Force Awakens. Also ends all the plot lines from The Force Awakens. Large chunks of the movie have no affect on the overall plot. The editing is nonsensical\\, with characters acting happy right after terrible events and failures.\\n\\nSorry that's a bit of a stream of consciousness\\, but it's a bad movie\\, and a worse star wars movie.","true":true}
