Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many of the people who went to see this movie \\, I was disappointed . They didn't handle the characters I've been loving my entire life well . They definitely let me down in this movie \\, so much that I don't think there is a way for the next movie to fix it .","true":true}
