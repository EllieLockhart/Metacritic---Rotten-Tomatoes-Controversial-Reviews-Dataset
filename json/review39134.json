Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This disgusting film is not Star Wars in any way. Even not considering this as a Star Wars film it is a garbage movie. It's trash. There is absolutly no redeeming factor for this disgusting film. Kathleen Kennedy and Brian Johnson are pathetic disgusting people and they make really pathetic and disgusting movies. Sub human scum like them do not belong in our society. They need to be put in Guantanamo. Disney is categorically destroying a beloved franchise out of spite. It's obvious to see. Disgusting and just pathetically stupid.","true":true}
