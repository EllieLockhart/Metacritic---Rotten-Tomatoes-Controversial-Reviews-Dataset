Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars super fan\\, I'm disappointed to admit that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" vomits all over character development\\, and contains a plethora of scenes that are intended to be heartfelt but are completely laughable.","true":true}
