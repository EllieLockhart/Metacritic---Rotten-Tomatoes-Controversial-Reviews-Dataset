Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Obviously this movie was rushed and or not viewed well by the execs approving it. Killing Snoke \\, Phasma \\, Luke ? All in one movie ? Felt like an easily killed Jabba\\, Executioner ship destroyed \\,and Vader in Jedi. Empire Snow Battle scene reference explosion \\, I found myself saying \\\" Imperial Troops have entered the base. \\\" Twice in my mind.  Luke disappearing like Yoda\\, I could go on and on. The movie felt rushed \\, bad character development\\, and a disrespectful end to the original trilogy. A mixture of Empire with Jedi on the worse scale possible. I should have known when I saw a Hardware Wars reference \\, this movie was going to be terrible. Rian Johnson you did have some humor in it \\, and the R2 scene with Luke was touching. So in essence  \\\" I laughed \\, I cried \\, I kissed 12 bucks goodbye.\\\"  That is my Hardware Wars reference too you. Hope this all gets fixed in episode IX.","true":true}
