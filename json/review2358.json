Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At the moment for me the order in which I like the SW movies (Episode numbering) is IV\\, V\\, VII\\, VI and VIII (not focusing on the numbers I\\, II\\, III which are in random order after no 8). This one sticks defintely to the normal Formula. Great Special Affects\\, Good action\\,good acting\\, nice story (dont mistake nice story for deep story). In addition a lot of very nice ooooh moments. The only negative points for me are main characters with a bit too much punclines (I really laughed when a LightSaber got toshed away\\, but it was not really fitting) en the entire long scene on the Casino planet. The last part was not that annoying that it was a bad scene\\, it was just completely not needed. Just another solid SW movie if you ask me. I can see why people dont like the movie that much\\, but the really low ratings ? Sorry cant follow that at all.","true":true}
