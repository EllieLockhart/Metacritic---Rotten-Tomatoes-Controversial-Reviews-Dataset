I can see why a lot of fans are hating some decisions especially made at the midpoint which you either accept It and go with it or you don\u2019t but in my opinion it\u2019s strong storytelling and character development. This is a near masterpiece. So here\u2019s the thing obviously graphics and gameplay are better in last of us 2 but last of us 1 was such a tight and perfectWow. Just wow. Incredible.

This is a near masterpiece. So here\u2019s the thing obviously graphics and gameplay are better in last of us 2 but last of us 1 was such a tight and perfect game whereas the last of us 2 is lonnnnnnnnngggggggg and it has some pacing issues and it could\u2019ve trimmed out at least 5 levels but at the same time you\u2019re happy to be in this world. Last of us 1 has 29 chaptersLast of us 2 has 46 chapters and you can really feel the length but you kinda need the length because the game really is an EPIC.It really is a game changer when it comes to story and gameplay in games.I\u2019ve never felt so conflicted by characters decisions in a game before.Like I said before this is a lonnnnnnnnnnnnngggg game and the pacing is a bit of a mess compared to the first game which was tight and to the point and in my opinion perfect. Overall I loved the last of us 2 despite its flaws. It\u2019s not as perfect as the first game but it\u2019s definitely a worthy sequel. The  Last Of Us series proves that games are truly a beautiful art form. I like to rate games out of 5 stars The Last of Us ***** out of 5The Last of Us 2 ****1\/2 out of 5\u2026 Expand","true":true}
