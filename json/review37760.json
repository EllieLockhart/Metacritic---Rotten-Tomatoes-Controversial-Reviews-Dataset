Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was so much wasted here. It wasted time\\, talent\\, and every single plot hook from the other movie. It is such a waste of the franchise the people adored. How the critics ever found it to be good I will never know.","true":true}
