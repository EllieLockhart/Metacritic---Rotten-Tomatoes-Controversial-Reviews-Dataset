Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was trash\\, the portrayal of Luke\\, Snoke's fate & Super Leia are the most antagonizing parts of the film for me\\, but not the only negative parts as the list goes on. I left theater disappointed and not looking forward to the franchise. Between the the last jedi and battlefront 2 2017 was a terrible year for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
