Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars ever made. Horrible plot with bad characters and story writting. Many of the creatures seems to come from Narnia (intended to sell toys) and didnt fit the mood and tone of the star wars universe.Also\\, they just ruined previously established characters like luke skywalke who is now a crazy old man fearfull and lonely on an island","true":true}
