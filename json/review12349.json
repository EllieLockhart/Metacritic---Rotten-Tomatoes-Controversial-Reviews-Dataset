Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am truly amazed at how many faults this movie had and still made me absolutely love it. I loved it even more the second time. I'm one of the 1977 fanboys for life. A lot of us seem to feel this movie is a slap in our face. I have not been so moved and excited in years. Sure\\, some points we were waiting on didn't pan out the way we hoped or expected. So what.  Loved it!","true":true}
