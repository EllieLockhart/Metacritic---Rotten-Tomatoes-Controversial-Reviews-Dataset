Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I ever saw. After years and years of non stop preaching of my friend about the original trilogy I watched all of them. And after watching this movie only one question was in my mind \\\"is this some kind of parody movie this doesn't make any sense at all.","true":true}
