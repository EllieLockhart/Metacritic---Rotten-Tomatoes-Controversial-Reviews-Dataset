Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When a trilogy is made-one would assume the three movies would be written together so they flow into each other. This movie was confusing\\, erratic and made no sense from the force awakens.\\n\\nThe subplots added nothing- the casino was ridiculous- adding new characters but getting rid of main ones made no sense. Finn deserved a much better plot and separating the main characters was a terrible idea.\\n\\nAlso- Luke Skywalker not wanting to help\\, never leaving the island and him not wanting to help- was not what Luke would've done.\\n\\n Also\\, Rey\\, was never properly trained and there wasn't one lightsaber fight and they didn't even mention the word- called it laser sword instead- so dumb.\\nThe movie was an insult to life long Star Wars fans.","true":true}
