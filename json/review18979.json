Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's between Last Jedi and Phantom menace for worst Star Wars movie to date.  Having been a Star Wars lover since seeing A New Hope\\, the SJW at disney have finally chased me away.  I enjoy story telling and it was disjointed most of the way.  I didn't find the acting or the actors very compelling. It didn't get me emotionally involved as I do with good movies.  I'm sure others liked it and I'm glad for them\\, but as for me\\, I'm through with Star Wars.","true":true}
