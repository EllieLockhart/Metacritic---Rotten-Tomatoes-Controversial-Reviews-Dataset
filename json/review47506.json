Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What just happened to the star wars universe? I literally no longer care what happens anymore. They took everything intriguing about the episode VII and tossed it right out the window. Not to mention them shitting all over your favorite characters from the first saga. This one is pretty much a middle finger to fans.","true":true}
