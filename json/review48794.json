Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie of the year\\, of the decade. Way to destroy a golden legendary franchise. Everything they did ruined everything they touched in this movie. I don't know how they could have done a worse job\\, hurt and destroyed the characters and story more than they did. Everything they did\\, EVERYTHING\\, was wrong and bad for Star Wars. Everything! Use your brain and really look at what they did! Horrible.","true":true}
