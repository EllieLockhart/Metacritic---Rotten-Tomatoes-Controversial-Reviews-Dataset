Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything bad anyone has said about this movie is 100% true.  I saw Star Wars in 1977 when I was 5 YEARS OLD.  I've seen all the movies countless times.  My husband and I left the theater after watching this horrific slap in the face and both decided if we went to hell and the choice was to  watch Jar Jar's movies for the rest of your life\\, or this one\\, we would both go with Jar Jar.  At least there was some originality in the Phantom Menace movies (lumping them together sorry).  This one\\, nothing\\, not one redeeming thing. SPOILERS  AHEAD  RIGHT NOW\\, NOT JOKING\\nI cannot even begin to say how said I am that this was Carrie Fisher's last movie\\, and her part was so much better than what Mark Hamill got stuck with.  They both deserved so much better\\, but Carrie Fisher will never have the chance to make another decent movie.  Luke was never my favorite character\\, but are you kidding me with this?  Milking a creepy breasted animal on the beach and then drinking it?  WTF was the purpose of that?  Tom Hardy's scene got cut and that got left in???  WHY?  And thanks for making Luke the biggest whiny dick of the galaxy. I mean really\\, hey sis\\, yeah\\, I ruined your kid\\, almost killed him\\, then won't take any responsibility for that and I'll leave the universe to rot\\, good luck!!  No one is buying that bullsh*t\\, being old and cranky isn't the same as trying to kill your nephew and leaving the universe to BE DESTROYED.  Did the director even watch Star Wars?  Did he hate it as a child? Was he traumatized by it in some way?  Because that's what I feel like.  Rian Johnson has some deep seated hatred for this franchise and this was his chance to get revenge on everyone involved in it. My favorite part was Chewie and the Porg co-pilot.  That's it\\, one 10 second clip was the only thing that put a smile on my face.  And Leia's ridiculous space walk?  Yes\\, sure\\, good luck with that pressurization back into the ship.  And killing Admiral Ackbar as an ASIDE?  Like hey\\, he's dead\\, too bad.  And Admiral purple hair (she's a great actress\\, but that's how much attachment we're given to her) can't figure out how to save the fleet?  Let's just watch it get destroyed while we're thinking...and thinking and thinking...  Oh and since all those ships that apparently had light speed could just get blown up anyway\\, couldn't you just jump one of them into the bad guys and solve the problem like 3 hours before we had to watch this disaster and save us all? And exactly what was the purpose of the whole casino sub plot?  Who was the damn guy wearing the pin that was in there for no reason whatsoever?  Thanks for answering exactly none of the plot lines and oh\\, Luke disappears into thin air with purpose.  I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER IT WAS WITH PURPOSE!  OMG\\, Just stop Disney\\, just stop!!!  I want my money back\\, I want everyone to get their money back\\, even if they enjoyed it\\, because I DON'T WANT DISNEY TO MAKE ONE CENT ON THIS FILM!!","true":true}
