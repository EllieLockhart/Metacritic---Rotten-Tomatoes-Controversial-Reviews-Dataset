Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning and edge of your seat action with empty characters with hollow motivations rife with SJW undertones that completely derail the beloved franchise. The director and writer disavows any understanding of physics at the same time as tearing down the characters that built the franchise and even the new mysteries presented in the last film.","true":true}
