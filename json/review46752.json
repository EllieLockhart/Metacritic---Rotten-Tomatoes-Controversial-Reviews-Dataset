Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well as a someone who saw the original 40 years ago aged 7 I have to say this is brilliant and where it needed to go.  I'm a fan again!","true":true}
