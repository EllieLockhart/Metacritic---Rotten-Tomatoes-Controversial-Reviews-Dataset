Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy is the feminist that destroyed Star Wars... and then she loved the Activism and \\\"RICH ARE BAD\\, and so are men\\\" message so much that she awarded Johnson a trilogy to do as he wishes... I'm sure it will be SPITE Wars\\, Battle for the most absorbent TAMPON. Star was was destroyed by SJWs. Not sure if I will see the next one.\\n\\nRay \\\"Emasculated\\\" Johnson used this ENTIRE to hoard ALL of the big moments of the trilogy. The deaths of Snoke\\, Phasma\\, Ackbar\\, Luke\\, Rey becoming a Jedi Master...Rian just hoarded ALL of them for himself\\, and left JJ practically NOTHING.? And now he has been rewarded a trilogy outside of the skywalker story... which doesn't exist anymore anyway\\, because the only living skywalker is actually dead in real life... siiiiiggghhhh  Like spoiled Children who were handed a Bentley and brought it home trashed.","true":true}
