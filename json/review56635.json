Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was underwhelming. There were momentarily when it looked like it was going to reveal a mystery of the universe and  bloop underwhelmed. \\nThe casino scene was not necessary and there are a million things in the Star Wars universe thatt could have been used to move the plot forward without another improbable scene involving big animals crashing into stuff. \\nSnoke captures Rey and bloop underwhelmed\\, Rey  sucked down what can only be described as the Dark Sides butt hole and bloop underwhelmed\\, Rey's parents are revealed As what is the Star Wars equivalent to two drunk college students on spring break at Daytona bloop underwhelmed. \\nThis is not to say there weren't some high points and over all it was a fun film but there are so many other things they could have done to make it great but went with safe instead","true":true}
