Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you go see it to enjoy a Star Wars movie\\, you'll love it. If you go in to it just to pick it apart you'll hate it. I for one enjoyed it. Don't let the audience score ruin it for you.","true":true}
