Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only recently became a star wars fan thanks to the force awakens. it is safe to say i am no longer a fan thanks to this movie. it is only the second in the franchise i have seen and is now the last. I hate this movie if you can even call it that. its a mess","true":true}
