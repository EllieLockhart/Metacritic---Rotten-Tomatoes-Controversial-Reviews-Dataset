Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My least favorite Star Wars episode. There are so many things wrong with it. Spoilers follow. The First Order can track ships through hyperspace now? Why bother making us wonder who Rey\u2019s parents are if they are no one important? We know nothing about Snoke\\, and probably won\u2019t now. I wanted to see how badass Luke had become\\, but we didn\u2019t get that. The characters were pretty one-dimensional. Physics problems. In space if a ship runs out of fuel\\, it doesn\u2019t slow down. Just dumb.","true":true}
