Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie didn't just leave every cliff hanger from Force Awakens unanswered\\, they closed them without comment.  Sad movie. Also\\, in the time it took a lightsaber to change hands\\, the entire republic was destroyed down to a handful of ships with no reason.  The absensce of a plot\\, abandonment of JJ Abrams story lines\\, and no cliff hangers to make me want to see the next movie\\, this served as the end to a great franchise. I was a casual fan\\, but will find my sci fi elsewhere.  The special effects were good\\, the action good\\, but Star Wars is about story and story just wasn't in this movie..","true":true}
