Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 1 was better then this piece of crap. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Force Awakens burned what was left of the Star Wars Universe which I loved. The Last Jedi urinates on on the ashes. The movie was slow\\, had plot hole after plot hole and a feminist barf fest. I've found something I hate more then Jar Jar. Actually I'd rather have a Jar Jar only movie then watch this junk again.  \\n\\nI'm going to be skipping the next episode.","true":true}
