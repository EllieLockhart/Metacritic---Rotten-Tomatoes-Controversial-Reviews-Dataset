Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long and incoherent.\\nLaura Dern's character might have been interesting\\nBut has no depth (a certain battle is mentioned\\, but then dismissed)... \\nWhy are the Dark Side leaders so stupid?\\nParticularly Kylo's inability to sense Luke's location.\\nBut clueless Snope comes pretty close.\\nThe Yoda ghost is a giggling waste of screen time.\\nThe love triangle (rectangle if we include The Kyle-Rey  connection is awful\\, and undermines Finn's loyalty to Rey... maybe he's her brother??
