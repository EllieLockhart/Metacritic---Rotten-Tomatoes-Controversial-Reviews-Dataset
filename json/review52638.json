Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All in all the movie just felt odd\\, and not quite Star Wars. Everything that was built with the new characters and the story in The Force Awakens seems to be thrown out the window in this film. Rose was a terrible character addition\\, and one that certainly shouldn't have been front and center in the development of Finn's character. The Rey and Kylo scenes were just weird\\, and felt as a distraction to the Luke and Rey storyline. Although\\, in the grand storyline they make a little more sense after seeing Rise of Skywalker\\, with their connection\\, but in real time they felt more random and out of place when they did occur in The Last Jedi. Poe was one of the best characters in TFA\\, but in this movie it felt like he took a backseat to Laura Dean's atrocious character. And Since when did Hyperspace become a weapon? It took 8 movies to introduce that? This movie has it moments but it feels like a complete one off from the saga\\, and not a continuation of the story.","true":true}
