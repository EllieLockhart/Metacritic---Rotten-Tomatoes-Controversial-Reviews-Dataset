Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie succeeded wildly. If the goal was to destroy the legacy of the original trilogy and Luke Skywalker. It\u2019s not even solely the narrative choices Rian Johnson went with that killed this movie\\, it\u2019s how poorly it was all done. Plot holes were everywhere\\, character development was forgotten or even worse...what was established in previous movies was undone and wasted\\, the plot was so lazily written that the movie actually felt boring and nonsensical with completely pointless storylines\\, and to top it all off...the character of Luke was utterly savaged and unrecognizable. At this point they might as well call this what it is... a shoddy remake of the original trilogy that steals every major plot point and would have you believe that simply slightly altering scenes from past movies as compelling new twists. It\u2019s telling when Mark Hamill himself hated the direction taken for Luke in this movie. And I thought Star Wars hit its lowest with The Phantom Menace...and here came The Last Jedi to prove how completely wrong I was. ","true":true}
