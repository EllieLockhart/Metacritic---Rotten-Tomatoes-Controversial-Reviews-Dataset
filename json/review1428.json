Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sad moment for all Star Wars fans as this episode becomes instantly mockable.\\n\\nSome really poor judgement calls from the director for this one as blunder and error combine with the worst Star Wars script to date and some pretty ridiculous events.\\n\\nStar Wars fans are rightly angry at this movie as it strips away all the emotional connection and leaves us with something akin to a cheap Game Of Thrones style deaths mixed with Transformers like vacuous action scenes.\\n\\nVery poor indeed.","true":true}
