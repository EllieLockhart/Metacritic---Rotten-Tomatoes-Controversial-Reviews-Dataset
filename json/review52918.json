Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Angry and Hurt by what Disney has done to destroy the franchise.  Just very thoughtless.  I feel like they decided to disrupt the physics of Star Wars the fabric of Star Wars\\, the laws of Star Wars\\, the axioms of Star Wars\\, the ethos of Star Wars\\, and they thought fans would be ok with it as long as they put the name Star Wars on the opening crawl.  This movie isn't Star Wars.  If you are a director and have any questions go back to Joseph Campbell\\, and archetypes when creating characters.  This movie was meant to have classical archetype characters... The youthful optimist\\, the reluctant hero\\, the wise sage\\, the evil villain.  Be thoughtful and respectful of the history and the physics of how the Star Wars universe that was created\\, space time\\, how the force works (you can't use the force to fly through space\\, otherwise kenobi could've just Force flown to alderan in the original movie.  You can't ram Star ships in hyperspace in Star Wars\\, that makes kamikazeeing an entire starfleet with one cruiser too easy\\, and could've been done in all the other movies.)\\n\\nThe reason audiences are angry with you Disney\\, is because you didn't create this movie in the Star Wars universe\\, you created it in a new universe.  Rogue one was a Star Wars flick\\, this movie isn't Star Wars.  you could've created a whole new franchise for this movie for people to see for this movie call it galaxy battle the final wizard\\, or universe conflict the only laser-sword wielder \\, please just don't call it Star Wars the last Jedi.  It doesn't fit.","true":true}
