Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please send me a refund for my money after having been swindled into watching any of this absolute crapfest of a film.  How is it even possible that the persons creating\\, producing\\, and writing this dung are even in the position to do so?  I have to give credit to these people for not just having horrible sequences\\, but actually stringing them together\\, one after another after another into a 2+ hour long fart. Amazing! I hated every bit of it\\, not just some parts.  I just have no words for this colossal failure.","true":true}
