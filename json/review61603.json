We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Played it (didn't pay for it \\, gameshare with a friend here) and to be honest. It was a meh not thaaat bad but not even good. The gameplay is the same from TLOU 1 \\, with the twist that now you can actually prone and jump at your own will. It's basically the same except now you have nicer graphics which imo isn't even important (Minecraft has one of the best rating and we are talking about pixelated graphics there). The story isn't even good. It's pretty mediocre and I'm not talking just about the golfing scene. It's everything \\, the side characters basically disappear from the game after they die \\, like if the have never existed. In Tlou1 when Tess dies she is mentioned plenty of times after that happens \\, here when a character dies that isn't thaaat important or relevant it just goes into oblivion. The writting is bad \\, the chars don't have the same feel like how it was in TLOU1. The \\\"revelation\\\" scene with Joel and Ellie is awful \\, not even emotional. It was a sequel nobody wanted\\, or at least it could have been just about Abby. Since almost 75% of the story with Abby is a \\\"new\\\" version of the journey with Joel and Ellie. It has an awful story \\, yeah it has an \\\"un-predictable ending\\\" but at the same time it makes the story even worse \\, Ellie kills tons of people \\, a dog \\, etc. Then \\\"revenge is bad\\\" \\, if we saw that in a different scenario like John Wick \\, RDR2 \\, RDR1 \\, etc it would be pointless and underwhelming \\, and this is the case for TLOU 2. Final note : I'm not even mad \\, it's a game. Even so\\, the game is pretty bad and it was disapointing. I'm sorry for the cast\\, since their VAs are awesome \\, but man the writting of this game is bad \\, very very bad.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
