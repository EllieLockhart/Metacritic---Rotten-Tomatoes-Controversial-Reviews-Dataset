Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing actually enjoyable to an actual stars war fan would be the picture quality. On the other point there was so much time wasted on irrelevant bull crap like the space vegas trip Fin took along with the pointless rose character. The most insulting aspect of this movie is a week ago Rey didn't even believe in the force and she somehow bested Luke sky walker in a little stick fight and was able to with ease is the force to move massive objects which took extensive training and a journey for Luke or any other Jedi to accomplish such feats. There's so much time wasted in this movie it's just ridiculous the story arc is just so terrible I feel like Disney made this movie for a bunch of 6 year olds. Personally I grew up loving the series and for them to overnight had the torch to Rey who does nothing to become a Jedi just disgusts me it's supposed to be a master and his\/her apprentice overcoming obstacles through trial and error like Obi wan and Anakin\\, the short lived Obi wan and Luke\\, and even more significantly Yoda and Luke. It's just very frustrating to true fans how Disney has destroyed the series and even more importantly the image of the Jedi.","true":true}
