Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As with all star wars movies\\, the more you watch it again\\, the more you enjoy it. Ignore the fan theories\\, and the web reviews in general. Just be happy we still get new star wars content. Especially when it's owned by a massive media company now.","true":true}
