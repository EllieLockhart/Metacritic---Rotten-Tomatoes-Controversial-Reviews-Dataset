Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing to say the least. Looked good\\, sounded good\\, lots of action\\, but poor story with a long boring sub plot full of CGI animals\\, horrible decisions regarding Luke's character\\, awful forced jokes and some cringe inducing moments. Felt like Thor Ragnarok or Guardian's of the Galaxy 2\\, or almost any other generic big budge CGI superhero\/space movie. \\nGlad JJ is back\\, maybe he can salvage something from this mess and end the trilogy with some dignity. After 40 years of being a fan I find myself almost not caring anymore if this is the direction Disney continues with.","true":true}
