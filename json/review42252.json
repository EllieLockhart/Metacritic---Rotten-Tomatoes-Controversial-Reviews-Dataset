Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie struggled to be mediocre even at its best parts.\\nThe surprises and plot twists are all underwhelming. The plot-line with the pink-haired lady was confusing and pointless. Storylines opened up by Abrams were closed by Johnson in the most disappointing ways possible. Luke Skywalker is nothing like he was in the original trilogy. Even the \\\"epic\\\" fight scene was poorly choreographed. I'm disappointed that I spent $12.00 to see this movie and will likely be avoiding Star Wars going forward.","true":true}
