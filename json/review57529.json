Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a slightly better film than the phantom menace. The movie starts off well enough but very soon (with in 10 minutes) takes a nose dive into a world of plot holes\\, political non scene and a complete disrespect for the story told before it. I'm not going to talk about the weak characters or pepper thin plot\\, that has already been done. Let's instead talk about the horrable treatment of legacy characters. Who are these people??? Luke would never act the way he did. Leia was a non factor. Chewie was pointless..... yada yada.... look I'm not passing judgment on you if you liked this movie and to be honest I didn't hate it. That said.... if this is where the franchise is going eh I will wait till the come to blu ray.... then again I might be out.","true":true}
