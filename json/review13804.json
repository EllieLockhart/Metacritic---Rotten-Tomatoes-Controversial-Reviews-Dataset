Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found this movie.... my favorite of the franchise. So many plot twists\\, so many interesting dynamics\\, it drove me crazy - and everyone that was on the movie with me. The reaction of the audience...to Kylo and Rey's dynamics\\, to Luke's scenes.... was incredible\\, they just couldn't stop clapping and i couldn't either.  I'm just amazed by this movie\\, i watched it on the premiere and I'm gonna watch it again on Sunday. It is that good.","true":true}
