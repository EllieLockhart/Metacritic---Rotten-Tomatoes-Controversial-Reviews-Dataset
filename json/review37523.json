Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reason I favor this movie is because I went into the show thinking one way and came out totally in awe of everything. The script got flipped. I have to admit\\, I thought I knew it all when it came to Star Wars and the messages in the movies. Clearly\\, this movie has caused some reactions and plenty of over reactions. The magnitude of the decisions that were made. I knew I had to let go of my childhood and I think Disney aided me a lot. Now I can move forward. I think if you have never suffered in life you won't like this movie.","true":true}
