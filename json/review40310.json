Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the best Star Wars movies ever. Everything is perfect besides the casting of Kelly Marie Tran\\, who did not deliver her lines with effectiveness\\, or at least enough sincerity. John Boyega is excellent in making Finn likable. Rian Johnson deserves a nomination for best writer at least. The color schemes of the lightsaber duel in the third act was phenomenal. Overall\\, an excellent addition.","true":true}
