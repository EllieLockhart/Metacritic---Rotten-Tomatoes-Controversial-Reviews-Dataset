Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killing\\, rather than extending or paying off\\, intriguing setups from its predecessor\\, presenting one story-logic inconsistency or frivolous subplot after another\\, and\\, least forgivably\\, wastefully disposing of the most beloved film hero of this generation\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" will come to be regarded as every bit the misstep as any of the prequel films--a case study in how not to write a story.","true":true}
