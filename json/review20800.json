Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this so much. I was stoked. I was hyped. My hopes were ridiculously high after The Force Awakens set such a rich storyline with so much potential. But Rian Johnson sh*t all over that with his own stupid attempts at being new and creative. (I cannot believe Disney gave him his own trilogy! He will just ruin the Star Wars universe even more.) So many plot holes that created more questions than answers\\, and so much useless and unnecessary fodder. Not to mention how he changed\/ruined all of the characters' personalities. And I won't even get into what he did to Luke... It's infuriating. Probably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I've ever experienced. Saw it multiple times in theatre\\, and bought it\\, of course\\, despite my discontent\\, but it took me over a week to watch it at home. It's just corny\\, contrived\\, and a total waste of great talent. What a tragedy. I am just so grateful that J.J. Abrams is taking over again.","true":true}
