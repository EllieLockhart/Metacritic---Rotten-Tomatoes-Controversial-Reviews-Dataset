This game is violent but it fits the theme.\r-Performance is overall good but they were horrible glitches sometimes and bugs.\r-AI and Difficulty customization is a thing that every studio should consider but yeah must have been expensive! You can even customize the overall look of the game.\r-This game took me 26 hours to beat and I still felt that I didn't check every corner.\r\rThe biggest problem I have with this game is the story.\rIt has phasing issues and very questionable choices. I honestly understand why some people won't finish the game because of those choices. Some people act out of character sometimes and after a couple of scenes\\, I understand the hate. I think some choices are forced which makes it sometimes feel like a bad episode of a tv series. Now I won't say that the story is absolutely horrible because it isn't but it could be a LOT better! It's a revenge story\\, I love revenge stories but I think the motives and shock value that game shows sometimes felt off.\rEven I said that the story isn't horrible\\, right now after finishing it\\, I don't feel to start it again anytime soon... right now it feels like it isn't worth it because of those choices ND made. After end credits\\, I just felt a hole in a chest. It feels like a one-off to me which is not a good sign. The ending got me hard and I can relate to it but I know for someone that isn't their cup of tea. Simply the game lacks a proper conclusion to its characters and story.\r\rThe Last of Us didn't need a sequel IMO. We had a game with simple gameplay but with a good story and loveable characters but now after 2 and what happens to some characters imagining going back to The Last of Us 1 breaks my heart. Right now I just hope that The Last of Us part 3 will not be a thing.\r\rThe Last of Us 2 is the beautiful pinnacle of showing how games have changed and how brutal they can be but it trembles badly on the story and it can leave you feeling hollow at the end.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
