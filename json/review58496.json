Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I\u2019ll start off with I have completed The Last of Us part 2 in its entirety. I have also played the first game multiple times and am a fan of the series like many others. Many people have expressed their anger\\, resentment\\, and disappointment with this game on the internet over the last couple of weeks to days. I feel this frustration comes from the game having had major spoilers Leak weeks prior to launch. Many people got key points of what happens given to them without playing the game. I will admit I was upset when I read some of the leaks\\, (you almost couldn\u2019t be on the internet if you didn\u2019t want to be spoiled). I tried as hard as I could to not spoil too much and let my experience the first time truly be my own. I think the game truly has to be played in its entirety before you can understand what they were trying to do with the story. If you are halfway through playing and write a review you won\u2019t be near where you would feel by the end. The jumps on time and cinematic flashbacks are key to feeling the way you should and cast light to why characters act the way they do. This story is beautiful\\, dark\\, gritty\\, passionate\\, expansive\\, and many other words of emotion all jammed into one. MY BIGGEST TAKE AWAY IS YOU CANNOT JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER OR MID PAGES\\, YOU HAVE TO READ IT IN ITS ENTIRETY! I so far have disagreed with many of the reviews I\u2019ve heard since the release of the game and I stand by my rating of the game. It truly is a masterpiece but one that you won\u2019t immediately see until completion.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
