Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"well... where do i start.\robviously killing joel and bringing in a freak character + that totally unneeded shoving obscure lgbt stuff down my throat makes me give a zero score. I just wanted to play a game! Get it?\r\rgraphics and the gameplay is mostly okay though and if you can ignore that freaky sexual stuff\\, then go ahead.\r\rall the puzzles are WAY TOO EASY to solve\\, everything is served to you on the gold platter. mostly looking around in the same or adjacent room is more than enough to find the final clue.\r\rvery annoying is the way ai works\\, all the enemies stroll on the same route\\, they are too predictable and the co-character always gets in my way when exploring rooms\/areas or when hiding behind obstacles to attack enemies. the other character get on my way ALL THE FREAKING TIME.\r\rAlso\\, too many cutscenes. TOO MANY!!! at the end of the first chapter\\, there are 4 cutscenes in a row\\, that's annoying\\, to say the least.\r\ri played it through and was hoping i can then select individual chapters and collect all the missing stuff\\, but as it turns out... at first all chapters were available and i started re-playing the first chapter\\, it then fookin thought it was a good idea to again hide all the rest of the chapters and now i have to play the whole game\\, all chapters in the original order again\\, to get 100% of the game. WTF\\, how did that happen? I did not do anything strange\\, After completing the game\\, I chose Story > Chapters > saw that all the chapters were playable > opened the first chapter > played it a bit > went back to main menu to choose another chapter and ... WHAM... only the first chapter Is playable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
