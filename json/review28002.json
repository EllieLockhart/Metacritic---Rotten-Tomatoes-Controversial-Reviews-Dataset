Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, destroyed any ideas started in TFA\\, and killed two of the most intriguing characters\\, Luke and Snoke with no explanation.  Very lazy story telling.  Then filler\\, casino scene\\, extended car chase scene; and Poe Dameron killing all the rebels.","true":true}
