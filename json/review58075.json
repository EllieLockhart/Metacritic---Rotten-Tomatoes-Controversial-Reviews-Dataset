Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worse than the prequels.\\n\\nThis movie is a dissapointment. Disney should not have bought Star Wars. Star Wars is my baby and Disney just fucked my baby to all hell. To be fair\\, this is the best looking SW movie by far with some of the coolest scenes but Disney couldnt hold back on their political bullshit. They have a Mary Sue(unrelatable character with no flaws) main character\\, a rich-people-are-horrible-for-being-rich message\\, and an animal cruelty message. Fucking animal cruelty! The hell were they thinking? And the funny thing is\\, the main characters save the animal but not the slaves! I say it again\\, the hell were they thinking? And the other funny part is how this movie shames rich people\\, the same people who made this movie! And they also have killed the only two positive white males in the universe because any white man portrayed as good in todays society is spit at and hated for some reason. Also\\, the very forced diversity was unsettling. Im no racist but\\, really? No good guy characters are white males\\, only the evil ones(kylo ren and snoke and the pasty white dude). They took something sacred and shoved their penis(political shit) into my baby(Star Wars)! Just let the ACTUAL FANS make our damned movie! I just want Star Wars\\, not SJW Wars.","true":true}
