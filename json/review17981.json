Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think people that like this movie are not real Star Wars fans.  I don't believe the critics anymore.  I suspicious they are under the influence of the big movie studios like Disney.  Just because Disney and the new Lucasfilm says it's canon\\, doesn't mean it's so.  Free your mind.","true":true}
