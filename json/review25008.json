Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My reaction when I first came home from seeing the film the first time:\\n\\nHard to not give this 5 stars. I liked it better than The Force Awakens. I put 4\\,5\\,8\\,7\\,6 and the rest as my favorites. Nice to see Luke do some stuff. :)\\n\\nAfter reading reviews:\\n\\nI just read a bunch of negative fan reviews. I guess people are passionate about the Star Wars universe and had expectations that the movie didn't meet. I watched the first movie when I was 12 years old and kind of grew up with the original trilogy. For me there was enough Luke and Leia - especially Luke to send me home from the theater happy. But sure it was long\\, lots of humor\\, odd subplot\\, etc. All reasonable criticism. But\\, I still had a blast. I'm glad it wasn't a rehash of old movie plots. They didn't blow up the death star again. They did not rely too much on nostalgia. The critters were cute but not overbearing like in 6. For me two and a half hours in the Star Wars universe of my youth left me longing for more and wondering when I can see the movie again.","true":true}
