Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*************spoilers******\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is Star Wars.   For die hard fans they will either hate it or love it.  For casual viewers from what I have seen personally they approved.\\n\\nFor years we have been obsessed with the Skywalker bloodline\\, but we seem to forget the most important thing: Heroes come from nothing.\\n\\nWe see Kylo Ren and Rey have the power to choose the destiny that they want.\\n\\n\\nWe see epic battles in beautiful scale.\\n\\nWe see concepts only ever visites in the originl expanded universe. ( Force projections? Suicide by hyperspace ram?)\\n\\nAmidst all of the darkness the cruelty\\, the death. It was fun and funny.\\n\\nIt did not go the way I thought. And thats okay. For too long it had familiar tropes and survived off of it.  This brings life back into star wars. Into individual characters. \\n\\nAgain. If you are a hardcore fan. You will either love it or hate it.","true":true}
