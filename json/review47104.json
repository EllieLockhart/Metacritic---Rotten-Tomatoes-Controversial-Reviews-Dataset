Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a huge disappointment. Somehow Disney has sucked all of the life\\, joy and excitement out of the Star Wars films and instead given us a terribly written\\, decently well acted and incredible looking shell of a movie that was riddled equally with plot holes and modern political talking points as if serving an agenda was more important than creating a true Star Wars film.\\n\\nThis \\\"inclusive\\\" piece of crap flatly ignored the Star Wars lore that has grown over the past 40 years and who's producers seem hell-bent on obliterating any connection that might have existed with the old films in favor of heavy-handed politically correct scripts and acting. \\n\\nI'm so sorry Star Wars.....you deserved FAR better then this!","true":true}
