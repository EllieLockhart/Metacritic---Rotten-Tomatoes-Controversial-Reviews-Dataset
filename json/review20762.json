Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like it but there's so much wrong with this movie.  The nonsensical premise of the main plot beat\\, the heart-breakingly poor handling of Luke Skywalker\\, the god awful casino world plot crammed with a bunch of hamfisted political commentary\\, the Holdo-Poe feud; I could go on and on.  About the only thing I actually liked was Rey and Kylo's relationship but they even botched that during Rey's moment of truth when they could have taken the story somewhere truly uncharted.\\n\\nOne of the worst Star Wars movies of all time.  Such a bummer.  The trajectory of the entire new trilogy is virtually unsalvageable at this point.","true":true}
