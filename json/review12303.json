Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am shocked at the positive reviews on here for this movie. I was very excited to see this\\, and thought the Force Awakens was very well done\\, and continued the story. With that context\\, this movie only deserves half a star for the cinematography. There is no plot in this film\\, no character development\\, and I felt like the script attempted to make this into a satire of the original film with weird jokes that didn't have any place and mocked the force and the spirit of the first three movies.  The characters do not develop at all from the Force Awakens and this story\\, or lack thereof\\, could have been done in 30 minutes.  Not sure why\/where the comparisons to the empire strike back come from\\, this movie is completely different\\, and doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence or breath as empire. I thought the movie also made Rey into a one dimensional hollow character without any depth. There is zero emotion or drama in this movie that promotes audience investment\\, unless you are paid to like it\\, which based upon the reviews seems like Disney did here.","true":true}
