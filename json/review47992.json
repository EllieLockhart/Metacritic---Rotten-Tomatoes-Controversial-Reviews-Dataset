Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While many fans didn't appreciate the new directions this movie took with established characters like Luke\\, I thought this was a fine addition to the saga that was significantly different from any other Star Wars film. Of course it had some obvious parallels to The Empire Strikes Back\\, but unlike The Force Awakens it did not blatantly reuse plot points and characters. If you didn't like the JJ Abrams marvel-esque humor of The Force Awakens\\, you probably wont like it here either\\, but it doesn't bring down the film for me. The star taken off is for the Canto-Bight sub plot which slowed down the pace of the film (although in my opinion it somewhat fits\\, I found it interesting that the entire plot was basically a lesson in how the good guys plans don't always go as expected.)\\, as well as the sometimes clumsy editing\\, and the god-awful Leia scene (if youve seen the film\\, you know what I'm talking about).","true":true}
