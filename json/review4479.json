Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Character development didn't make sense and story writers seem to erase everything that the books and starwars universe established.  It's like the director never saw or read the original Star Wars movies.  I have never not finished a Star Wars movie.  This movie was disappointing.","true":true}
