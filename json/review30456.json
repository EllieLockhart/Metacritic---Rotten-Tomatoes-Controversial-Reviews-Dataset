{"101487":166736,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shabby.\\nThat's the best word to describe the handling of this story and its' characters.\\nLuke\\, sulking for decades over a student gone dark\\, sucks from giant walrus tits before killing himself.  No one answers the SOS call from Leia\\, once the beacon of the Republic\/Resistance\\, but now a space-travelling Mary Poppins.  Rey's parents are drunk nobodies (an opportunity wasted).  Kylo Ren\\, once a bad-ass who could kill his own father\\, now can't finish his mother.  The only bad-ass antagonist\\, Snoke\\, is handily killed before we even know his origins.  Poe\\, brave to the point of recklessness in two movies\\, aborts a bomb run at the last minute because he can't face death--even after all his wing-men have died.  Finn is given a red-herring of a mission that includes imprisonment for a parking violation and then betrayal by a fellow he knew wasn't the right man to begin with.\\nThere are no decent light saber battles.  The last\\, 'boss' battle\\, after many cut-scenes\\, turns out to be fake.\\nThe Force Powers displayed were over-the-top-that-not-even-Yoda-could-do\\, and by people who had no training or never showed any ability of that caliber before.  There is no struggle to even find\/master the force--it can now be controlled between quips.\\nAfter a 'bombing run' gone bad (classic WWII action\\, except--how do bombs 'fall' in space?) followed by a boring chase across the galaxy\\, the Republic\/Resistance is gone.  As in\\, the remnants fit into the Millennium Falcon.  We're told to put our hopes on 10 year old slave children.\\nAs far as I can tell\\, there are just two Force Users left.  Actually\\, three\\, but we know with Carrie Fisher's death\\, Leia is doomed.\\nEverything you know about the Star Wars universe has been burnt to the ground\\, and frankly\\, shat upon.  I understand Disney needing to start a new cast and story-line\\, but why did they have to end the old cast\/story like this?  Luke Skywalker sucking on giant walrus nipples--are you kidding me?!?\\nShabby.  \\n\\np.s.: Go watch 'Jumanji.'  It is EXACTLY the same story as Star Wars\\, complete with special powers\\, and yet far more entertaining and inspiring than Star Wars\\, TLJ can ever aspire to be.","true":true}
