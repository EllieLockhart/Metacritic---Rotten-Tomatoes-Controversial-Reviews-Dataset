Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Oh boy\\, where to begin...Firstly I would like to say that I never completed the first game purely because I didn\u2019t like the gameplay but I Ioved the story so much that I watched a full walkthrough on youtube.

The first game isOh boy\\, where to begin...Firstly I would like to say that I never completed the first game purely because I didn\u2019t like the gameplay but I Ioved the story so much that I watched a full walkthrough on youtube. Normally with me if I don\u2019t enjoy the gameplay on ANY game\\, I will stop playing and will forget about the game like I never played it\\, but not with The Last Of Us. The first game is DEFINITELY one of the best written games ever and the connection you had between yourself and the characters is so amazing that you didn\u2019t even have to play the game to feel that way\\, and even though I didn\u2019t enjoy the gameplay I personally feel that the story was AT LEAST 9\/10. And now moving onto the second game...I want to say that when the games plot leaked originally I didn\u2019t mind and I thought it would just get better by context\\, but oh man I was 100% wrong. I Then started to panic a bit when it was coming out that 70% of the studio left because they didn\u2019t like the way the game was heading and the way they treated their staff leading up to the release of this game (AKA Johnathan Cooper). And then that leaves us up till now\\, when the game has released. I have seen pretty much a walkthrough of the whole game missing out some parts like the middle but overall I know what this game is. All I have to say is Neil Druckmann and Anita Sarkeesian should NEVER be allowed to go anywhere near the gaming industry EVER AGAIN. And before people start to call me a homophobe\\, this is not the reason I HATE this game it is because of...1. The absolute HORRENDOUS character development\/writing. You could genuinely remove some of these people from the game and it would make a difference AT ALL.2. The CLEAR AGENDA THEY ARE SHOVING DOWN EVERYONES THROATS. Politics shouldn\u2019t be in games unless it is significant and essential to the games story\/plot.3. The DISRESPECT they have shown fans from the first game because this is EVERYTHING WE DIDN\u2019T WANT. I could think of a hundred better directions this game could have gone in.4. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. I COULD GO ON FOREVER AND EVER.I honestly don\u2019t want to go on because what they have done to this franchise is CRIMINAL and the disrespect they have shown characters that we fell in love with in the original is nothing short of disgusting. I could go over so much more but it genuinely makes me sad\\, don\u2019t get me wrong this game is beautiful in terms of graphics and it\u2019s gameplay looks much better than the first but the reason we fell in love with the last of us is because of the story. AND THEY COMPLETELY DESTROYED IT. I honestly can\u2019t believe they thought this was a good idea and in my eyes\\, there is only ONE The Last Of Us.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
