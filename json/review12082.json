Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with much of the criticism about the handling of Luke now.... and think Poe was just wasted - he was a complete moron 90% of the time. Overall\\, I don\u2019t hate the movie - it had nice set pieces - but seemed very uneven\\, and un-Star-Wars-y. It is currently in my bottom 3 along with Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
