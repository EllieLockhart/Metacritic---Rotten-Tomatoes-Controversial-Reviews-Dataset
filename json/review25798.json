Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not bad but not great either. Ryan messes up a few story lines that were created in The Force Awakens and in previous films. Lots of missed opportunities as well. But I was entertained through out. Hopefully JJ can fix everything up in the new movie this December and give Star Wars that magic feel again.","true":true}
