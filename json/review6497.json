Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disrespectful\\, unnecesarly long\\, unfunny and pointless. Most of its characters go backwards on their archs or dont advance. The only redeemable quality of this film are the visuals\\, and if for you that makes it a good film you've put star wars at the level of transformers","true":true}
