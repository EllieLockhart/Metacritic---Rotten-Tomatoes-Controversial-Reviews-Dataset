Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subtle things stood out to me\\, the flaws of some of our fav characters were brought to the forefront\\, etc. - all giving me a great SW experience! I saw SW in 1977\\, have been hooked since...some movies I've enjoyed more than others\\, the Last Jedi was a good one.","true":true}
