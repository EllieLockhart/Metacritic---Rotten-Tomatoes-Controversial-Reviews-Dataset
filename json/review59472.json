I loved the first game due to the story being a masterpiece in my eyes with others saying the same. I went in open-minded ready for how the beloved characters stories would evolve more and where this game would take me. Then Joel dies a character I\u2019ve come to like a lot and the death is in a way where you feel both sad and angry\\, but after this the story becomes predictable and a bit cliche. My main problem with the game is how they try to demonize Ellie while making Abby ( a character you don\u2019t like in the first place) good. Looking at both Ellie\u2019s and Abby\u2019s skills and weapons there\u2019s quite a difference in the quality with Abby coming out on top. Then with little things like Ellie killing Mel with things like Ellie killing Abby\u2019s dog and Mel who happened to be pregnant. I don\u2019t understand why things happen the way they do. I played the entire game at least trying to get revenge and even that was taken away from me . The only thing keeping the game from a lower score is the gameplay improve ment .\u2026 Expand","true":true}
