Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" to be a fun entry in the Disney Star Wars franchise that\\, despite some flaws\\, is a must see in theaters.  It continues where \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" leaves off\\, showing the New Order's response to having their base and weapon blown up by the rebellion\\, much like \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" did after the original movie. It also mixes things up enough to not be entirely the same.  While there is less action in this movie than others\\, it does add story and depth to some of the characters.  Some characters are overlooked in this department despite their setup in the previous movie.  The action scenes\\, while not very numerous\\, aren't as impressive as other entries\\, with some exceptions\\, but they are still enjoyable with the good ones being quite impressive and fun.  The tone of the movie seems too lighthearted at times for the overall plot and expectation set up in the trailer.   Still\\, there were plenty of humorous moments that fit right in place and had me laughing\\, serious moments that felt the weight that they should\\, and emotional moments that made me feel for the characters.  I will warn Star Wars fans to leave their fan theories at the door and go into this with no expectations or else you will be very disappointed.","true":true}
