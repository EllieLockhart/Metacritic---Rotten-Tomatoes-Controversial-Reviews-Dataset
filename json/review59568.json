Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was supposed to be one of the most anticipated games ever. I'm sorry naughty dog but you've lost me and my wife as fans of yours. You may not care now but previous fans will think twice next time you create a game. The biggest problem I have is\\, besides Joel being killed almost immediately a long with just about everyone else\\, and fighting Ellie or playing most of the game as Abby\\, is the political environment you created. Why is a video game getting political?? Bad move. Most gamers are not interested in being force fed \\\"gender equality\\\" or being forced to watch two females have a relationship in a game. I'm guessing you received funding from some company that wanted that agenda pushed. Really bad move. I play games for the story and entertainment\\, not politics. I get enough of that from the awful media. What an amazing first game you created but this one has ruined the whole story\\, and I know you say you expected this and are ok with this\\, but are you really?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
