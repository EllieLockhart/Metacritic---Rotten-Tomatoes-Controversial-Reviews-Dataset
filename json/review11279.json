Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Also just a poorly made movie in general. The writers\\, director\\, and everyone involved should be utterly ashamed. It's sad that a few good actors and actresses had to work with the rest of these amateurs on this piece of hot garbage.","true":true}
