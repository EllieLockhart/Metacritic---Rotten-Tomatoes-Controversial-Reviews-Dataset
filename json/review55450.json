Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Messy mish mash of Star Wars ... things.  Needs a lot more Jedi story and a lot less of everything else.  \\\"Humor\\\" missed on all levels and completely out of place. Stop swapping directors and writers.  Snoke was anticlimactic(who was he and why haven't we heard of him before) Poe could be a cool character if done right.  Get rid of Finn\\, Rose\\, Laura Dern Character\\, Benecio Character\\, focus more on story and less on visual.  I'd say let's just stop making Star Wars but we all know this story is going to be destroyed not that it's in corporate hands.  Every new Star Wars movie after Jedi just hurts the Star Wars brand.  I could go on but I won't keep bashing.  On a positive I thought the Luke scene was pretty epic.  I don't like that he's gone already. Ben Solos power is completely inconsistent.  He should be fighting so far advanced to Rey at this point regardless of strength in the force.  Rey has no lineage... dumb.  Solo has Skywalker blood he should be more powerful\\, and where's the rest of the family?  Ok I'm out of energy on this.","true":true}
