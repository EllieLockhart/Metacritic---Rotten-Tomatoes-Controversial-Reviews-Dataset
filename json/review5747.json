Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Director Rian Johnson takes the wheel and turns everything you think you know about Star Wars on its head. Love it or hate it\\, you won't be bored. Star Wars episode 8 will be a film everyone will be talking about for quite a long time. The only complaint I have is that the movie does suffer from some unnecessary subplots and has a little too many moments where you can tell Disney was trying too hard to appeal to a younger audience. Oh\\, and it would seem that they're trying to add a little more of that uncomfortable forced \\\"Marvel type humor\\\" to the mix. Stop it. Don't do that. Other than that\\, I was thoroughly entertained and pleasantly surprised at every turn. Here's hoping that episode 9 will take as many risks as this one did.","true":true}
