Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These movies under Disney have been the biggest disappointments in franchise history. It's sad to see how Disney has blundered the integrity of Star Wars. Now in wake of turning on the fans and proven facts of approval scores being faked and tainted shows how low Disney is willing to go and accept this kind of rhetoric. SJW banter and today's political agendas should be kept out of Star Wars because with failed toy sales\\, bad reviews\\, Disney employees fighting the fans and Solo bombing in the box office. Disney needs to wake up and figure whst to do with Kathleen Kennedy and Rion Johnson. They are killing the franchise !","true":true}
