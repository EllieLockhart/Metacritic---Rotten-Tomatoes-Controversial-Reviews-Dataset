Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rubbish. No depth at all\\, sneaks snoake\\, more like a joke\\, where is his story\\, his background\\, his development? Porgs are a Blatant ripoff of groot! No ideas at all\\, the acting is comical and the execution of the movie is just plain crap! And what's with the female girl power thing? Just seems to be another massive movie made simply to make money\\, not for the story or the source material!","true":true}
