Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad story; could have been written by a grade schooler. Not that the original trilogy were the best movies ever\\, but at least they were intriguing and engagingly This film had some spectacular effects and some head nods to the original series but there was not much beneath the surface. The only thing entertaining from The Last Jedi is the flame war it has spawned.","true":true}
