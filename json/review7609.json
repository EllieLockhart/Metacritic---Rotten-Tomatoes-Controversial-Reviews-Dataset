Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Everything is meaningless in a cold and uncaring universe!\\\" - that's the lesson the movie tries to impart on the audience. I don't need to be reminded of life's unrelenting bleakness; I watch Star Wars for hopeful escapism. Events which should have meaning are robbed of them\\, events which shouldn't are suddenly impactful. The movie isn't subverting expectations in a clever manner\\, it's giving a giant middle finger to the audience gleefully when they least expect it\\, rejoicing in its childish contrarianism.","true":true}
