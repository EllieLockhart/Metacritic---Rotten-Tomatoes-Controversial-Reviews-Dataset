Not the fake internet mob who hate to see greatness shine unless it follows exactly what they want rather than experience Ming what the developer wants to tell. This was never Our story(fans of the game) \\, this was Joel and Ellie\u2019s story and it\u2019s worth all the twists and turns. All the the heartache and heartwarming moments. A true work of art that has to be experienced to understand to its fullest. Game of the Generation HANDS DOWN.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
