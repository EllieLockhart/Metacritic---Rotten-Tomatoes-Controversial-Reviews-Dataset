Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half is really lame\\, and both halves of the script are abysmal\\, but the second half is pretty good. Lots of cool new aliens\\, and teh Rey\/Ren stuff is the best thing Disney's done since buying Pixar. Too much Finn\\, again; not enough Poe\\, again. But overall it's not bad for a Star Wars movie post 1980.","true":true}
