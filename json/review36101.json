Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a fresh new Star Wars movie that greatly expanded the development of all the characters\\, had exciting twists and turns\\, great exciting action sequences\\, while maintaining the old school Star Wars joy.  I think Star Wars fans are their own worst enemy\\, never knowing what they want\\, the negative reviews of The Last Jedi from hardcore fans are quite frankly shocking to me\\, but to each their own.  A few small scenes didn't work for me but overall this movie is the best Star Wars movie since Empire.","true":true}
