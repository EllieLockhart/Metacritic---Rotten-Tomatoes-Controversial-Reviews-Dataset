Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyed the latest Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi. There is some unexpected twists but was expected. Couple were unpredicted. I was expecting a lot of action over dialog. There was that and although it felt rushed in certain areas I overall enjoyed it over the any of EP1-3. I rate this up there with Return of the Jedi and New Hope but behind Empire an Rogue One. Good job Disney.","true":true}
