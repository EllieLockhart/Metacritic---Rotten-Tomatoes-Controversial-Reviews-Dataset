Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Ok take a deep breath and just listen to me. First of all I think that the last of part 2 is one of the biggest masterpiecies of the entire decade. I think that the story might not be happy\\, but it is a huge huge success at telling a deep meaningful story of the humanity and the world that Ellie\\, Abby\\, Joel etc live in. What most of the people that disliked the game don't understand and it's really difficult to understand because the only way you can get the story is by knowing that it is a deep really deep meannig that other films and games have used in the past and this way they just underestimate the game. Like what humanity can do and what a person is capable of doing about something that is really meaningful for him.Ellie lost her \\\"father\\\" joel cause he couldn't live without her\\, let me explain.Joel could't let ellie die because their relationship was as powerful as his daughter's shara and because he lost his trust to the humanity because \\\"humanity killed\\\" his daughter indirectly and that maked him selfish and only caring about his life and nothing else that's why he has killed so many innocent people. I am not hatting Joel but I am just saying that he did many bad things and after getting his daughter back he started a new life and trying to be a better person and forget his past but it was too late to change his character and the thinks he did were not forgivable and what he trying to do was to just not let her go before him and he succeed in doing. Now I am really tired because I can talk about the game the story and the characters litreally foreverthanks for hearing me sorry that I didn't cover some mayor thing such as the character of ellie but I am really tired of writting btw sorry for my english. Thx for hering what I had to say and I this game\u2026 Expand","true":true}
