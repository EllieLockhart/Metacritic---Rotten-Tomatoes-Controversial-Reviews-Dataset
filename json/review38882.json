Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They killed the goose which laid golden eggs\\, and that goose was Luke Skywalker. And he didn't even have one proper lightsaber fight! Nor did Snoke!","true":true}
