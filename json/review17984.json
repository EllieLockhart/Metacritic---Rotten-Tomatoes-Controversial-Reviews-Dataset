Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think Rian Johnson did a fantastic job of making an individual\\, stand out\\, star wars film. His treatment of Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo were simply fantastic. Although the other characters were not expanded well\\, Johnson had to include them and he did okay\\, not great\\, but okay. Ultimately\\, I'm a bit torn. This should have made a fantastic 100 minute movie but became a solid 180 minute movie.","true":true}
