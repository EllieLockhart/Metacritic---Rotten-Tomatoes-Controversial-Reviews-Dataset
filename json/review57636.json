Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plots \\nBad plots\\nRey is a bad character (still)\\nDaisy Ridley is a bad actress\\nToo much inconsistency and nonsense (being alive in space\\, opening doors straight to space\\, characters going against what they say ((\\\"theres no light left in Kylo\\\"))[or whatever]\\, Luke holding dumb dice and touching Leia despite being a hologram and his clothes moving in the wind)\\nThe obvious political agenda being \/forced\/\\nAnd worst of all\\, Luke's final fight is short\\, essentially worthless because he was just a hologram doing things with his mind\\, and is basically stalling.
