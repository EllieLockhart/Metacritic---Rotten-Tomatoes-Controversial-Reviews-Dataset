Just like JRPGs there are random encounters with enemies in the open map. Brawls are melee fights\\, the fighting system is deep and varied\\, you can choose from 3 different fighting styles (tank\\, fighter\\, rogue)\\, with some excellent high-level finishers having to be unlocked first.\r\rYakuza 0 is set in 1988 Japan\\, with the country's economic bubble about to burst. The story is about 2 protagonists (series regular Kiryu Kazuma\\, and newly added Goro Majima) being involved in an internal Yakuza power struggle\\, both of them trying to survive. Lead characters are very likeable and develop during the story's length.\r\rThe campaign can last dozens of hours\\, but not all of them are quality time. That's because of the inclusion of 2 time-consuming mini-campaigns\\, one for each protagonist. Kiryu Kazuma's real estate and Goro Majima's hostess club business should have been a 1-2 hours affair to see through\\, but they each last more than 10 hours to complete\\, so you are basically looking at a 20-hour-long grinding. These activities are optional but you can't really avoid them and focus on the main story\\, or else you won't be able to upgrade your heroes past a certain point\\, and you will need those upgrades especially in the higher difficulties.\r\rThe game is also full of side quests. These are either small fetch quests or just a quick story unfolding before you in a matter of minutes\\, but the writing is usually top notch. Plenty of comical stories but also some dramatic ones. A standout for me was the couple of quests paying tribute to the late Michael Jackson\\, complete with his moonwalk and dancing.\r\rLast but not least\\, there are tons of mini games\\, from darts and billiards to bowling and karaoke\\, even Sega's old Outrun arcade game.\r\rNot everything is rosy though. The game's map of Kamurocho is identical to the version included in other Yakuza games. If you play a couple of Yakuza games it can become tiresome to see Kamurocho again. Then there is the issue with the camera. Because the map is tightly packed (typical of Japan) the camera can't easily follow your hero when walking in narrow corridors or building interiors. It should have been an over-the-shoulder type of camera. But these are all my gripes.\r\rOn the technical side\\, Yakuza 0 runs at 60 fps just like Yakuza Kiwami\\, frame rates drops only in a couple of heavy scenes with dozens of enemies on-screen. The OST is nice\\, with a few standout rock tracks. Voice overs are in japanese\\, there is no option for english dubs\\, but you get used to that.\r\rOverall\\, Yakuza 0 is a great game\\, even though it's not perfect. Yakuza Kiwami is a better game and a more suitable introduction to the series. If you play the 1st game and you like it\\, then proceed to Yakuza 0 and the other entries.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
