Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just flat out bad. Every time you think something interesting will happen it just ends and jumps to something else. Plot makes no sense. Few questions from the last film are answered and the ones that are are answered extremely disappointingly. This doesn\u2019t even feel like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
