Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One reviewer just wrote:\\\"To the 5 star posters\\, you are not just losing the cultural war\\, you have lost it...\\\"   What does that have to do with Star Wars. Please get some help. \\n\\nThis movie is great. For some reason it triggered a lot of people with mental problems.","true":true}
