Take note of how many of them are brand new accounts with only one rating and one review and it will give you an idea how hard the ideological far-left are trying to manipulate the results for this one. Comments copy-pasted across dozens of reviews. 10\/10 scores from people who are certain to have never played the game. It's sad that this is the current state of the world.\r\rAs for the game itself... it's bad. It doesn't respect your intelligence\\, it doesn't respect the original game\\, it doesn't even respect itself. All good storytelling was thrown out the window in favor of pushing the \\\"woke\\\" agenda and coddling the directors ego. The gameplay can still be fun\\, it's basically more of the same that you'd expect from the first game\\, but the writers obvious disdain for fans of the original game make it an unbearable experience for anyone who once loved it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
