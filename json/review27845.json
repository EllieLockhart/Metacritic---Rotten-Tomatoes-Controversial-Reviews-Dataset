Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Phenomenal addition to not only the new trilogy\\, but the Star Wars universe as a whole. Despite from the semi frequent humor copouts\\, this film managed to keep me on the edge of my seat and take my breath away through sheer emotion during its many moments. This movie had callbacks\\, but didn't bank all on them and forged its own plot. Very bold directing\\, loved every minute of it.","true":true}
