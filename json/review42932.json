Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was stupid to say the least. Leia surviving outer space and floating back to the ship like a witch\\, Luke having some weird outer body experience\\, the pointless casino plot and scene\\, the wasted Captain Phasma\\, no one knowing who or what Snoke is\\, does or how he even became anything to the Dark Side and the corny humor used to generate laughs. Terrible and not worth seeing ever again.","true":true}
