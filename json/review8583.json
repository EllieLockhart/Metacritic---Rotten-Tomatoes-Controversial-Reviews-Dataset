Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"-First of all\\, the first stories\\, both the part of the escape of the resistance and the part of Rey in the island\\, are parts of 1h that don't contribute anything. \\n-Minute 5 and Kylo Ren is no longer Vader 2\\, he pops his mask (which by the way was pretty cool) and go.\\n-Luke's role\\, except for the last 20 minutes\\, is completely superfluous. \\n-What about Benicio's role...\\n-Characters such as Luke himself\\, Captain Phasma or Snoke are wasted. \\n-And then there are 3-4 moments in which they pass\\, the Leia moment floating in the space... no words. \\n-This \\\"homage\\\" to Vader's rescue by Luke\\, repeated by Rey with Kylo. \\n-What\\, by the way\\, being so boring with the thing of who Rey's parents were\\, and now it turns out they're nobody. \\n-We continue with the \\\"gifted\\\" Rey\\, with 2 lessons from Luke and a couple of hours of solitary training\\, she is able to beat Snoke's bodyguards and move a thousand stones quietly. \\n-And by the way\\, I'm the only one who thinks Yoda's made a mess of it?","true":true}
