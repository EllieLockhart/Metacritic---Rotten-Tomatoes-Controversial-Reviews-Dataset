They exceeded the last game\\, however the story was written and executed in the worst possible. The problem in the story wasn\u2019t that Joel died (most people already expected that) but the way he was killed was the main problem. Killing off a beloved character from the previous game in the most disrespectful way to invoke emotion from the player is a horrible is a easy and lazily written plot\\, Especially by the hands of a new character who the audience does not even care for. We play roughly 10+ hours of the game playing as Abby\\, a ridiculously muscular woman who killed Joel in the beginning of the game. The game fails to get the audience to sympathize with Abby even after revealing her past and her motivations for killing Joe\u2026 Expand","true":true}
