Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I usually never do reviews but created an account because I needed to vent and also counter the individuals that claim these reviews are done by bots.\\nThis movie left me with mixed feelings and mildly confused\/in denial. For most reasons already mentioned in other reviews. The longer I analyzed the movie the worse it got.\\nApart from sloppy writing this movie is designed to upset long-time fans on many levels and on many occasions. Again\\, for reasons already mentioned in other reviews. This was a professional hitjob. I've read about ignoring Chekov's gun but I think it goes way beyond that. Not only is every expectation killed\\, there is simply no fulfillment at all. Viewers need characters to succeed or die\\, as we wish subconciously ourselves. Now let's compare: \\n\\nTLJ \\n- luke fights but wait it was a projection. Evaporates and is dead\\, or is he?\\n- casino storyline does not meet its goal\\n- phasma is not killed but falls to death\\, or is she?\\n- finn goes to die in the big hole of the canon but gets blocked at the last moment (I won't even get into the freudian elements here but it is an obvious theme throughout the movie)","true":true}
