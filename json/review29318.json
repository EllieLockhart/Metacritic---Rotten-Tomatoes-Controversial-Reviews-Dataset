Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and all of the cast have created a movie that is truly worthy being called one of the greatest Star Wars movies of all time to come!! It's fun\\, emotional\\, funny\\, unpredictable and just down right amazing!!! People will certainly feel this is one the great ways to end the year. After seeing that movie I have huge trust and faith in Johnson's new future Trilogy as well as really looking forward to Episode 9! I won't spoil\\, I'll just tell you this movie is really \\\"not going to go\\, the way you thing\\\" ;)","true":true}
