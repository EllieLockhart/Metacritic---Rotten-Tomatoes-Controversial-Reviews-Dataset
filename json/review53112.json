Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A triumph for Rian Johnson and despite the vitriol from misguided fans\\, I have no doubt that this one will really stand the test of time. It is visually audacious and filled with wonderful idiosyncrasies but the great thing here is how Johnson smartly ignores much of the \\\"Mystery Box\\\" structure of The Force Awakens (even finding a convincing way to resolve that film's impossible cliffhanger) in favor of more self-reflective themes.","true":true}
