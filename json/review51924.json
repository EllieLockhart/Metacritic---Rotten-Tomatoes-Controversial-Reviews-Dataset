Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film with a ton of unexpected and welcomed twists and turns.  Rian Johnson delivers a fast moving\\, bold\\, and new star wars movie without much retread at all with enough wow moments to make you come back for a second or maybe even third outing.  I had a blast.","true":true}
