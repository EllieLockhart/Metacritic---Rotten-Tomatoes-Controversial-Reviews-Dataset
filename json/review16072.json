Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm amending this to 1 star as I hear 1\/2 stars don't count.  I guess the 1 Star can be for John Williams\\, the only part of this crap-fest that didn't totally suck.\\n\\nI can't even bring myself to write the review this steaming pile deserves.  My 40 year love of Star Wars has been sharted on.  Any true fan\\, anyone who loves Luke Skywalker\\, I implore you to walk away\\, run away\\, this WILL ruin it all.  Rian Buttface Johnson has burned the world of Star Wars\\, that you love\\, to the ground.  Eat a pile of poop Rian.","true":true}
