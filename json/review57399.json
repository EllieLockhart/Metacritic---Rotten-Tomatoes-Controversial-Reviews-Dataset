Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie... Ugh. That is the only word that comes to mind. The attempted humor fell flat and felt extremely out of place for a Star Wars movie. At times\\, I had to remind myself I wasn't watching The Avengers. The writing was mediocre at best\\, at times feeling extremely forced and not at all compelling. I won't add any spoilers\\, so all I'll say is that the new characters introduced did not demonstrate any reason for their existence\\, and were a detriment to the overall story. At one point Leia does something superhuman and\\, frankly\\, ridiculous\\, without any explanation as to why she was capable of doing what she did. There were other instances of ridiculousness like this\\, which leads me to wonder whether or not the people involved with this movie have ever watched a Star Wars movie besides Episode 7\\, and whether or not Disney is about to announce Leia is joining The Avengers (joke\\, in case you didn't catch that). Luke Skywalker's character was destroyed in this movie\\, and I will never be able to watch the original trilogy in the same way ever again. And not in a good way. At the end of the day\\, this isn't a good movie. Anyone who says it is\\, well\\, I would love to hear their reasoning\\, because I saw almost no redeeming factors.","true":true}
