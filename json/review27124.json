Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of THE worst follow up films to a trilogy entry of all time\\, I think. Regardless if you think The Force Awakens is cookie cutter or not\\, it setup some interesting plot points that The Last Jedi not only did not honor interestingly\\, but at some points\\, flat out ignored them.","true":true}
