Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for this movie as I had quite enjoyed both 'Force Awakens' and Rogue one\\, but was seriously let down. The writing was bad enough that it kept pulling me out of the movie.  Some examples:\\n\\n1) The first order is apparently so blisteringly incompetent that their first two decisions on showing up are to not eliminate the rebels only means of escape\\, and to not launch their own only means of defense against attack.\\n\\n2) The rebel commander is so criminally lacking in leadership that they give the impression that the situation is completely hopless.  I can understand their not sharing what the plan is\\, but they actively give the impression that there is no plan whatsoever and they are just waiting out the clock until everyone dies.\\n\\n3) It is impossible to respect either Snoke\\, Phasma\\, or Hux\\, with the latter downgraded to comic relief.\\n\\n4) It is hard to respect either Luke or Leia\\, both of which manifest deus ex machina powers out of nowhere.\\n\\n5) A similar unearned twist is finding one of the best hackers in the galaxy in a drunk tank\\, and having him join the protagonists after he effectively saves their butts twice in rapid succession.\\n\\n6) Kylo Ren loves to tell us how much of a badass he is yet in action he's a prevaricating ninny.  This is a cardinal of movie making and the opposite of the 'show\\, don't tell' which should be done.\\n\\n7) Similar to the writing for Kylo Ren\\, the writing for Rey keeps telling us how great she is and how she's a Jedi yet they keep showing us that thse veers for the darkside ditch at every opportunity.\\n\\nI'm upset to hear that Rian will be writing the next one too and plan to sit that one out until I've seen the reviews.  This movie was visually impressive but a story and execution disaster.","true":true}
