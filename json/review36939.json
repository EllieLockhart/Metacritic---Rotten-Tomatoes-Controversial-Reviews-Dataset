Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was great until the last 10 minutes. Then\\, the worst thing that could happen to this nine movie story arc happened and rendered the last movie unneeded. I am at a loss for words and can only say that I have no interest in Rey. I am interested in the story of the Skywalker family. We'll have to see if the last movie can be one that ends the story giving the Skywalkers the attention they deserve.","true":true}
