While I think that trailers and marketing campaigns shouldn't spoil a game\\, there is a line where it goes from being anti-spoiler to flat out lying to trick fans into buying the game for false reasons\\, and Naughty Dog went over than line numerous times.\rGameplay wise\\, it is exactly the same as the first one. That's not exactly a bad thing\\, if it ain't broke don't fix it\\, but it only worked in the first one because of the story\\, where every cutscene brought new and interesting plot development\\, why what you were doing and where you were made sense. This time around it is just tedious\\, side mission after side mission that aren't important\\, fighting the exact same enemies in the exact same way hundreds of times.\r\rTL;DR Don't buy it. Graphics good\\, game-play poor\\, storyline abysmal.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
