Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going to start out by saying I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. I really enjoyed them though...except this one. First of all\\, Ren is such a whiny\\, pathetic villain I was excited to see Snoke so the series would have a decent villain. But then he is killed leaving us with Ren again who proves to still be a whiny baby in the next few scenes. Secondly\\, the entire plan created by Po to save the day is complete garbage. So we have to sit through this rescue attempt so that all the heroes of the movie can basically get over half the rebellion's people killed off. Next\\, Luke Skywalker...he's like an old man yelling at Rey to get off his lawn. I was looking forward too her getting proper training so there could be a bad-ass female heroine in the franchise. Instead he refuses to train her so she's still bumbling around not knowing what she's doing. Please don't even bring up the creepy green milk scene or the Princess Leia is now Mary Poppins scene. Lastly\\, where was the epic battle scene? The ramming of Snoke's ship was just okay. It's Star Wars...It needed way more. ","true":true}
