Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of Star Wars\\, I can safely say\\, that aside from some \\\"Awww\\\" moments\\, the movie failed completely in being a solid continuation to episode VII.\\nThe way the script is so poorly managed with cheap jokes\\, and childish comebacks\\, and also the way that the characters are so weakly built. Leia is the most powerful \\\"Jedi\\\"\\, surviving a situation not even a Jedi Master from the Jedi Council could\\, and also completely disregarding the whole established mythos laid in before this movie.\\nSnoke is the most useless overlord ever\\, how did he establish the First Order when his grip on the Force is so feeble\\, that he can't actually feel a murderous intention on his person\\, as well as Palpatine?\\n\\nThis movie totally disrespect not only the fans\\, in a way as awefull as  the new Ghostbusters\\, but also the characters that these fans grew up with\\, and when those same characters come out defending the same views as the original fans of this beloved saga\\, we can come to the conclusion that\\, paraphrasing Jar Jar Binks\\, \\\"Well\\, Dat Smells Stinkowiff.\\\".\\n\\nFrom quick tries at comedy (sure\\, Luke is now Jackie Chan with the dry humor of the 10th Doctor)\\, bad cuts or character flaws\\, even the All powerfull Snoake\\, now looks like a boyscout\\, when compared to Palpatine.\\n\\nThere where more moments of \\\"That's not how the force works\\\"\\,  enough to make the atoms of Han Sollo writhe in his Starkiller base explosion cloudy tomb.\\n\\nWe'll see how the IX will be\\, but for now\\, my expectations are in an all time low.","true":true}
