Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes and stupid add ins that waste time.  There is a lot that makes no sense and comes off as being just useless and of opposite of the feel of the rest of the saga.  This movie feels very disjointed from the rest of the body of work it is loosely connected to.  Very disappointing all around. \\\"Subverted my expectations\\\" because I thought it would be a good movie. \\n\\nIt is made worse after the fact by LFS\\, Producers\\, Directors\\, and others attached to the project making light of the long time fan's perspectives.  Even long time fans and certain cast members have said they disagreed with the direction of the film and the choices made for the roles.\\n\\nThe only thing good was the SFX but upon further examination\\, they fail as well as nonsensical. Take the bombing raid or the Leia Popping scenes\\,  or the Snoke catastrophe or lightspeed as a weapon. Great looking\\,  but make no sense or chime off as dumb when you think about beyond how it looks. Style over substance at its finest. \\n\\nDon't bother listening to anyone who says this is great\\, or even a good star wars film  because at best\\,  it was a well funded\\, poorly written fan-fiction.  And don't listen at all to the 5 Star reviews by any of the Presidents... You will see them\\,  Lucas plants have invaded... Andrew J\\, Grover C\\, Thomas J\\, ect","true":true}
