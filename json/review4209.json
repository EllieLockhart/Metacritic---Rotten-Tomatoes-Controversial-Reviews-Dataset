Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the best 'Star Wars' since the original trilogy.  Butt-hurt narrow-minded haters would be the death of this awesome universe.  Thankful RJ breathed new life into it and sets it up to grow and continue telling epic\\, but a bit more humanized\\, stories of the struggle between good and evil.","true":true}
