Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't trust the \\\"critics\\\" reviews.  The plot is just a really slow chase scene.  The pacing was awful.  The casino planet was an incredible waste of time.  Characters that should have been developed got nothing.  The \\\"comedy\\\" was sitcom corny and poorly timed.  This movie gets two stars: one for special effects and the other for acting.  The only really interesting character was Kylo Ren.  Oh\\, and Rey is still a Mary Sue (Daisy's acting is good\\, but the character is just severely lacking).","true":true}
