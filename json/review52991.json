{"101487":105037,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a film STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI is a good film. For it stops there.. beloved characters are not what they should be the personality or core  essence of the characters are not there. I Didn't care for characters. For example LUKE  WAS JUST OUT OF SORTS FOR ME  disjointed from the Luke of old(THE GREAT REDEEMER\\,THE HOPE). It didn't feel like the friend that I thought Starwars and I were. If felt more like I was watching a Battle Star Galactic film. Not STAR WARS for me this my be my last STAR WARS film GUD BYE OLD FRIEND IT WAS ABLAST WILL MISS YOU BUDDY.. ITS NOT YOU ITS ME ??","true":true}
