Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As Kathleen Kennedy stated\\, \\\"I have a responsibility to the company that I work with. I don't feel that I have a responsibility to cater in some way. I would never just seize on saying\\, 'Well\\, this is a franchise that's appealed primarily to men for many\\, many years\\, and therefore I owe men something.'\\\"  At best\\, this decision is poor marketing; ignoring the fan base that made Star Wars as popular and iconic as it is\\, and at best\\, it's a spiked-bat being used to bludgeon politically-correct ideology down the throats of a public\\, unwilling to spend upwards of $100\/family for the privilege of being preached to for 2.5 hours. I gave them a chance after TFA\\, but they blew it big time... my family and I are done with Star Wars.","true":true}
