Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was good. New plots and characters and story. And it had cool call backs. Anyone comparing worse than prequels is a person that wasn't much of a fan in the first place. I liked the new direction and if people think that's the answer for (spoiler) than they are easily fooled.","true":true}
