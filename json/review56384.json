Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible writing\\, numerous plot holes.  Absolutely POINTLESS characters like \\\"Admiral\\\" Holdo\\, who seemed inserted just to add more feminist flair to the movie\\, yet her acting was abysmal and her role could have just as easily been served by Admiral Ackbar.  Sure\\, he may not have gotten much screen time in the past\\, but he was a fan favorite.  Then there's an even more unceremonious send-off that seemed like Rian Johnson forced into the movie for the sole purpose of making things come full circle with the scene from A New Hope.  It as a nice scene -- it could\\, and should\\, have been beautiful.  Instead\\, it simply felt forced\\, out with the old\\, in the with mediocre new.  I also thought Daisy Ridley's performance was lackluster compared to TFA\\, while Adam Driver exceeded expectations and is poised to potentially become a real scene stealer in Episode IX if Ridley doesn't deliver again.  All in all\\, I'd take Jar-Jar over this pitiful attempt at writing and shock factor of a film.  It's sad to watch my favorite childhood universe and the EU be turned into this politically correct\\, out with the old in the with new\\, coupled with garbage writing piece of trash.  Even more disgusting is the fact that Johnson is slated to direct more movies.  \\n\\nI don't think the man could be more out of touch with the Star Wars universe\\, the politics\\, the Jedi and Sith\\, and the intricacies that bind them all together.","true":true}
