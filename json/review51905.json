Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that calls for the beauty of mixed feelings and ambiguity\\, while leaving me with almost nothing to feel at all. I\u2019m saddened by the direction of one of my most beloved and inspirational directors\\, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy\u2019s choice. She made us believe her intentions all along were to make films for the franchises fans. The Last Jedi is truly the opposition of that sentiment and left me with confusion and disappointment. The whole time you watch it you wonder what\u2019s wrong with it against it\u2019s beautiful visual landscape. My hope is that the film will get better with time. ","true":true}
