Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not going to rehash all that is wrong with this movie\\, considerable effort has been put forth to do this in the previous posts and you tube videos. The movie is simply terrible\\, complete trash. It amazes me that professionals with huge resources behind them came up with this storyline. My Son could write a more compelling storyline that honors the past while breaking ground for the future. Kennedy and Johnson need to be removed from all future projects. The audience score should be in the low thirties. It would be if not for the random five star posts with no substance inflating the score. This is no doubt a product of the Disney social media department. Total Trash...Can you tell I hate it? ....","true":true}
