Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely butchered the original characters and had no connection to any of the new ones. So many holes in this story. Only thing good about it are the visual effects - but that is not what I paid to watch.","true":true}
