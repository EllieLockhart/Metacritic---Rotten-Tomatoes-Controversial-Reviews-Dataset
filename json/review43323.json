Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great movie! I don't know why every butt hurt fan is all upset that they changed things that tends to happen in franchises that last this long! Yes it had it's flaws and certain things that I didn't like. But over all as a whole I thought it was great and nowhere near the prequels like a lot of fans are saying. would definitely reccomend going out to watch!","true":true}
