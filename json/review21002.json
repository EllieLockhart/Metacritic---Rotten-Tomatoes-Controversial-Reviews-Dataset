Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was not a fan of the previous two (really 5 Star Wars movies). This one by far was better than the prequels and the last two that Disney put out. It's a MUST SEE!\\n\\nComedy\\, Action seans were a great mix! The storyline coupled with amazing special affects were\\, pun intended here\\, out of this world!\\n\\nGo see it!","true":true}
