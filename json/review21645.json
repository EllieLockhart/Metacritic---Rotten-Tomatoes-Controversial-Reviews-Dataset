Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a bad movie in so many ways. Rian Johnson must really think he is cool to do all of the lame things he did in this movie. Bad humor\\, made Hux a joke\\, BB8 a joke\\, Pasma a joke\\, Poe a joke\\, Snoke a joke\\, Luke a joke. i like Rey but she  is not challenged in anyway again! Even a number of fans that liked the movie did not like the Canto Blight story. Also I am not a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, EU fan\\, troll\\, bot\\, racist\\, sexisxt\\, or against social injustist. I am a person who likes to watch movies and I did not like this one.","true":true}
