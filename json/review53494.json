Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't waste your money. Genuinely confused at the very high rating\\, when Rotten Tomatoes is usually pretty bang on accurate.\\nToo much reliance on slapstick\\, humour\\, and cute little creatures. Characters were totally flat\\, underdeveloped and one dimensional. Felt like a lot of the dialogue was the actors speaking to the audience to explain the plot lines\\, and not talking to each other.\\nThe plot itself was full of logical leaps of faith and completely unbelievable moments\\, to the point of ridiculousness. Decisions made by many characters simply made no sense\\, often seemingly just to add to the sense of drama in particular key scenes. I'd write about specific examples\\, but this is not a spoiler post.\\nI'd say it's not as bad as The Phantom Menace\\, but that would be a lie.","true":true}
