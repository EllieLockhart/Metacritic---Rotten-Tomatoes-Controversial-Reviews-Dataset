Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible writing\\, pointless and inconsequential subplots\\, and ridiculous\\, cringeworthy scenes and dialog put this Star Wars movie in the junk pile along with the prequels. TFA set this trilogy up beautifully\\, and this movie stomps all over over it like a piece of trash. A total wasted opportunity; Disney should be ashamed of themselves. ","true":true}
