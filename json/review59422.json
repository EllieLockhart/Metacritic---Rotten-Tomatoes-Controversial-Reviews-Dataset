The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Warning spoilersFirst of am gonna throw shots on the haters first\\, I know we all have our own opinions but hear me out. When I hear people say that Neil Druckman \\\"RUINED\\\" TLOU\\, you guys are using the wrong word in my opinion. You can say its bad that's it. And to the people who's having a hard time connecting with Abby and her friends\\, that's because you guys are just too connected with Joel that you don't care about Abby's story. Joel killed Abby's dad and saves Ellie just for his own ego\\, that's why Abby kills Joel. Yes Joel didn't have the send off that we all wanted but that's life man\\, we always don't get what we want. And I agree Naughty Dog did false advertise\\, I get that. I know we all expected the game to be another Joel and Ellie adventure\\, people just wants the same game all over again. But its also nice for naughty dog to do something different in the story. And to all the players who thinks Abby's and other charcters are poorly written\\, that's cause you guys are too connected with Joel. Joel is not the hero here\\, he's an anti-hero. Cause if he we're a hero\\, then he could've sacrificed Ellie and his ego\\, to save humanity\\, but Joel did the opposite. So after all the people Joel killed in that hospital\\, you will expect for a group or anyone to have their revenge. And Abby would've gotten her revenge when Ellie killed all of her friends\\, but what did Abby do? She let Ellie and Dina go. Abby isn't a bad person\\, theirs a reason why she killed Joel\\, and none of you care\\, cause one of you (sorry) are soft. I mean in the world where Ellie and Abby is born\\, you WILL expect someone to die in a violent way. Now I heard alot of gamers hate the ending\\, where Ellie left Dina and baby J.J just to go kill Abby\\, she returns\\, and she lost 2 fingers. That's cause even if she killed Abby\\, what will that cost? Abby killed Joel\\, and what does that cost? But what I think people hate more about this game is Joel's death\\, just cause he doesn't have a proper send off. And I agree they could've done a lot better. They could've done the way TellTale games send Lee off. But this is TLOU\\, expect the unexpectedBut those are just my opinion\\, might not be hame of the decade\\, but it is no doubt game of the year.If you think NaughtyDog RUINED TLOU\\, it's not naughty dog's fault\\, its just that the game  isn't for some gamers.Btw I did hate the 6 sceneThey didn't need to add that.....Btw that's my opinion....Overall best game I played this year\u2026 Expand","true":true}
