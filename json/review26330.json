Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst movie but\\, sadly\\, nothing special. The movie was far too long to have such little character development. Any chance this film has of making the viewer feel something is often sabotaged by an awkward attempt at comedy. As a casual fan of Star Wars\\, the worst part for me was the series of anti-climactic resolutions to questions that were posed in The Force Awakens. Going forward\\, I'm left less than curious as to how the story will progress.","true":true}
