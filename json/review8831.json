Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this falls between Rogue One and The Force Awakens in terms of my Star Wars movie ranking. I really enjoyed TFA\\, and I was not particularly enthused with Rogue One. I had mixed feelings about this one. Which might have been Rian Johnson's goal\\, but while there are plenty of movie styles\/genres I watch hoping to be challenged\\, Star Wars movies are not one of them. At the very least\\, it seems to thumb its nose at TFA\\, which is a weird decision to make\\, all things considered. It still has a lot to enjoy\\, but if your fondest memories are of the original trilogy and its themes\\, brace yourself for this.","true":true}
