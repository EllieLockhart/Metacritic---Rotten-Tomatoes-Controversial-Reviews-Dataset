Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never seen such a conflicting movie before. You have some really terrific scenes that are absolutely amazing and they make you instantly want to see the next show\\, that blow away your expectations after The Force Awakens. On the other hand you have some overly childish plot points and inane repetitive dialogue. The surprise ending to some of the titanic fight scenes was embarrassing and felt hollow (Finn and Phasma). The actors were largely incredible given what scripts they had to deal with\\, notably Hamill and Adam Driver. Visually this is the best Star Wars I've seen. The visuals in action scenes stand out amongst other movies and Rian Johnson did a great job compared to J.J. \\\"Lens Flare\\\" Abrams in this regard. The dark sides (ie. bad scripting) of the show are overwhelmed by the light until you get to the end. The cumulative point in the end of the film reveals the Last Jedi for what it really is\\, just a movie where a director attempted to \\\"leave his mark\\\" on the stain known as Hollywood and it suffers greatly for it.","true":true}
