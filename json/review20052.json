Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was just one character assassination after another. Not to mention assassination of the star wars universe. Slicers are now just called hackers\\, and people are saying 'godspeed' because why not\\, let's bring god into this. And I say this as a christian\\, god should not be in star wars.","true":true}
