Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best part of this movie is the production value.  It looks good.  As stills frames\\, the movie is fantastic.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, the plot and characters are dead on arrival.  The best characters are Rey and Kylo Ren and they have some interesting moments.\\n\\nEverything and everyone else is poorly written and confused.  None of the plots make sense.  None of the character motivations make sense.  The film contradicts other Star Wars and also itself.","true":true}
