Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Movie with some really underwhelming results from characters that deserved to do more. That being said\\, I still loved it. A shit ton of action. Rian Johnson basically turned Star Wars on its head. He performed order 66 on pretty much everything about the lore. His vision is pretty brutal\\, and not as romantic as the original movies. One things for sure\\, opinions on this movie is going to split the fanbase.","true":true}
