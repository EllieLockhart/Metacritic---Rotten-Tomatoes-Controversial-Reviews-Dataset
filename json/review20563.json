Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been so disappointed in all my life.  I grew up with a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door\\, and I had the green lightsaber that\\, back then\\, you had to actually put a flashlight in because we didn't have the technology we have now.  But it was enough for me.  I loved pretending I was Luke Skywalker because he did whatever needed to be done to save the galaxy.  Even if he had to go a little darkside to do it.\\nThis movie\\, this disgrace\\, ruins Luke.  I nearly cried several times in the movie\\, not because it was a sad part\\, but because I couldn't believe what they were doing.  To those of us that really love(d) Star Wars there's history\\, there is a foundation of fundamentals.  Luke is the most powerful Jedi ever.  You made us wait almost 40 years to see him again\\, and we're left with nothing.  He dies like a broken old man.  Weak\\, and forgettable.   Johnson (the director) said he grew up loving the films.  I find that hard to believe.  When I first heard Disney bought Star Wars I was elated.  I thought it was finally going to bring to life what we had all been waiting for.  Instead\\, Disney destroyed it.  Yoda is a childish buffoon\\, Leia can seemingly fly and breath in outer space\\, and Poe\\, Rey\\, and Finn are so horrible that it's hard to watch them.  And they aren't bad actors\\, they're just being led down a horrible road.  We're promised to learn Snoke's and Rey's origins and we don't.  And then there's this big push at Del Toro's character who we only know as \\\"DJ'.  If you love Star Wars\\, don't watch this movie.  Go read a novel or write your own ending to Luke.  I thought TFA was the worst I had ever seen.  This\\, this right here\\, is the most epic disappointment I have ever seen.  Congrats\\, Disney\\, you've shown everyone that selling to you means an end to all things people know in love.  Maybe next time you'll just write your own science fiction drama and leave our's alone.  The one thing this movie took away from all Star Wars fans\\, was hope.","true":true}
