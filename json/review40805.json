Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie blew almost every opportunity it had to be a great film. Shit writing\\, and the only reason anyone will give it benefit of the doubt is because Star Wars is in the title\\, and because the movie tried to be edgy and different. This movie is why I won't see the next one in theaters after I've seen every movie I was alive to see the first night. Plot holes\\, and misuse of known characters.","true":true}
