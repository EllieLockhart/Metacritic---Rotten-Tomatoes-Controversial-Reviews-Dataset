Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you to everyone on Rotten Tomatoes for confirming I didn't lose my mind at the theater last night. I got home and was so upset. Was I the only one?  Critics gave this a 94% so I MUST have missed something\\, right?  I have never had a more disappointing movie going experience in my life. Luke - wasted.  Mary Poppins Leia - joke.  Snoke?  Apparently a side character who really DOESN'T matter (making TFA a completely different movie)?   Shirtless Kylo?  What?!?!  Sitting in space\\, not being able to attack the Republic for 90 minutes...waiting for them to run out of fuel?  Luke milked a creature and drank it?!?! I get it - call back to the blue\/green milk from ANH but what the actual $%^&?!?!?  I thought FOR SURE Luke was going to be the heavy\/bad guy at the end. Or MAYBE there would be an epic lightsaber duel.  No payoff.  And now Han Solo's death seems more pointless.  I really do feel bad to Rian right now - I have no doubt he tried delivering something great - he simply missed BIGTIME.  Thank you again RT.","true":true}
