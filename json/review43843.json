Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will grow on the haters with time\\, just like Empire did.  The trilogy is not finished and I think that\\, ultimately\\, this will take Star Wars in a new direction\\, which is not a bad thing.  Disney can't just make the original trilogy over and over again.  For great movie making to happen\\, they have to take us somewhere new and surprising\\, just like the originals did.","true":true}
