AngryJoe\\, Pewdiepie\\, Tyler1\\, all rate the game at 1\/10 or below.\r\rWhy is the game being rated so low? Well\\, for one very glaring reason that has nothing to do with homophobia. Plenty of games feature gay \/ non-binary characters\\, but everyone accepts them because they are amazing - like in Apex Legends.\r\rThe utter hate for this game has to do with the fact that in the first two hours\\, they take half of what made the first game salable - Joel\\, and brutally murder him. Then\\, a few hours later\\, they make you play as the person who murdered him\\, and they try to get you to sympathize with her actions. Then\\, the top it all off\\, at the very end\\, after playing as Ellie and killing hundreds of people - you don't kill the person who killed your father in the end. Only a psychotic would find this story acceptable or not morally repugnant.\r\rThis is probably going to ruin Naughty Dog\\, but Neil Druckmann and co. are so arrogant as to think that people not liking their game is either due to homophobia or \\\"bots.\\\" The reality is that the market will dictate their fate. The company might go bankrupt as a result of this horrible treatment of one of their only franchises\\, as well as their treatment of fans. Naughty Dog games never had enough depth to warrant high sales rates other than likable \/ salable characters. Without their characters\\, their games are boring\\, linear\\, and critically lacking in depth. They just killed their best one and then had you play as their killer. They'll probably murder Nathan Drake yet\\, if they get to even make Unchartered 5. I doubt they would.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
