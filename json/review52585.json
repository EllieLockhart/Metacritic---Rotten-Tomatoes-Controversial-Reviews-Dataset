Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A little more comedic than I wanted\\, but The Last Jedi is a very fun and enjoyable new chapter in the Star Wars saga with exciting action scenes\\, really good performances\\, and amazing visual effects.","true":true}
