Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How anticlimactic was snokes death?  He died in the middle of tge middle movie of the trilogy? No luke vs snoke? The whole movie plot was the rebel ship is barely out of range to wear the laser shots that are hitting it aren't causing damage? So they're waiting for them to run out of power to catch up? You mean to tell me a fully functioning giant ship can't catch up to a rebel ship running out of gas? The first movie blatantly copied episode 4\\, this one copied return of the jedi with the whole Rey trying to turn kylo was like when luke was tryimg to turn vader. Then kylo killing snoke was like Vader killing the emperor. And where is he from again? What is he? How did he get so messed up looking? Where did he learn the dark side? Don't know\\, and he's dead so we wont ever know. Yeah she took out the ship at light speed but it didn't blow up? Seriously?  After getting hit by a giant ship at light speed they had time for a sword fight?","true":true}
