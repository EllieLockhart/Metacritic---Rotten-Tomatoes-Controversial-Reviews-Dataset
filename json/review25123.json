Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never did a single movie make me so angry ever. It totally disrespected Star Wars and butchered Luke Skywalker's character in contempt. I felt rage and sadness long after watching and decided this bullshit was not Star Wars. Unsatisfying\\, zero-entertainment\\, it brought nothing but pain and disgust.","true":true}
