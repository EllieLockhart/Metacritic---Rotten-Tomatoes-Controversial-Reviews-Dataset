Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's difficult to deal with disappointment. The failures of our heroes\\, the overturning of our expectations. These are some of the very deep and mature themes in The Last Jedi that some people are grappling with and finding themselves unable to cope with.  \\nAside from one of the side stories which has some poor pacing and prequel feeling CGI\\, this is a wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe. The last part of the movie has some of the greatest sequences in any Star Wars movie. \\nUltimately\\, I think fans should see it and make up their own minds. For me\\, though I think TFA was a cleaner\\, tighter movie\\, TLJ is harsh and gritty and heartbreaking\\,which makes it hard to love at times\\, but in the end\\, it is an entertaining and meaningful movie.","true":true}
