Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very poor writing\\, destroys the saga's rich legacy and add's twist that make no sense.  The humor is far off the mark\\, and while the action is okay minus one fight sense\\, and mark Hamill's performance is great it doesn't save the last jedi.  the first order and it's command are made to look completely incompetent and can not be taken seriously as antagonist.  meanwhile the protagonist is a reduced to a mary sue that gets great power with hardly no training at all.  by far\\, the worst movie in the franchise.","true":true}
