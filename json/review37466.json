Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many problems with this movie I couldn't even begin to list them all. If I had to zero in on one thing\\, it's the director's utter lack of respect for Luke Skywalker's character. It felt like every single choice made for almost every character in this movie was wrong. And the worst part is that Luke's entire story from the original trilogy is sort of canceled out\\, so the movie doesn't just ruin Luke\\, it ruins the entire OT on top of it. Second\\, the story completely ignores\\, or dismisses out of hand\\, almost all of the questions set up in The Force Awakens\\, and it dismisses them in a very flippant way too. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was in this movie\\, nearly walked out of it before it was over.","true":true}
