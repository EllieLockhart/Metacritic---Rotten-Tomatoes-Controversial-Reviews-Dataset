Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. Ik people say it does not follow the story line of star wars and it does not feel like a star wars movie\\, but its different and surprising and people should stop hating. I probably wouldn't have liked it if it was the same thing.","true":true}
