Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete garbage. The comedic dialogue ruins serious scenes\\, marry goddamn poppins\\, MaREY Sue and her continued ability to conquer any challenge that comes her way\\, Finn and Rose have no chemistry\\, Finn is still regulated to a Jar Jar role pretty much\\, the whole casino scene was unnecessary\\, complete character assasination of Luke not to mention that god awful milk scene\\, constant political and social commentary and the constant porgs being shoved in the viewers faces. I give the CGI a 6\/10\\, Mark's acting along with Carrie with what they had a 10\/10\\, everyone else were socially awkward and in short this movie was a dumpster fire and nothing but sjw BS and merchandise promotion.","true":true}
