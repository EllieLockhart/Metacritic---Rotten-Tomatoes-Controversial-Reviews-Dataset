Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star wars ever.Many people waited 30 plus years to see an Iconic hero turn to a tit squeezing creepy uncle.The movie had no real character believability.It tried to dazzle everyone with useless special effects.There were so many pointless sub plots that did not work.Too many inuido's.Chewie is shamed for eating meat.Luke milks the tit's of a sea cow which is supposed to be a revolting scene.That worked which was totally irrelevant to the plot line.The Porgs had better lines than Luke did.The Sith didn't kill the Jedi\\,Disney did.Disney's plan is to bring back all the older character's to pervert them and kill them off to the younger generation.This way they can make NEW DISNEY Star wars with all new Disney politically correct characters.\\nThe next movie should be an all Porg movie were they pull out Chewie's teeth and make him drink the Sea cow milk till he dies\\,then have a big celebration at the end with fireworks.Hell even bring back Jar Jar.","true":true}
