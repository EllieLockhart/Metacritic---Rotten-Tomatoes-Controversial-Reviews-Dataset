Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While flashy and entertaining\\, the story was not as good. Few parts fit the previous movie\\, too many forced \\\"funny\\\" moments\\, the writing didn't fit the characters and too much missing information and storylines. While Mark Hamill played the part well\\, who the character was I couldn't tell. It didn't fit the part of a master Jedi.","true":true}
