Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I speak for the vast majority of people when I say that this was an unsuccessful film. I knew they liked to repeat stuff that is irrelevant\\, but they had to repeat Jar Jar Binks? \\\"Hey it's okay though! It's a she! And this she is diverse.\\\" Stop beating this dead horse! Critics say they honor Star Wars because of its emotion and actions. Star Wars has not been emotional since 2005. The only thing that makes people like it is that there is a woman in the lead. I love most women characters in movies. But I can't stand anyone in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Rey was a cheat move. Making her perfect at everything. Rose was very unneeded in every way possible. And worst of all. The one that proves my point the most\\, Admiral Holdo. Ackbar was killed off just so that they could have more female leaders. I like female movie characters too\\, big just because they are now taking over Star Wars does not earn it the praise that critics believe.","true":true}
