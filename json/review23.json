I cant say enough to describe how much i fell in love with Yakuza 0 and both Yakuza Kiwami's ... this series has a charm that i cant describe... no wonder why its Sega's best selling masterpiece. From funny side stories to Dramatic ones and the Main plot of each game are all masterpieces. Sadly until now there are only 3 Yakuza games on PC Yakuza 0\\, Kiwami and Kiwami 2 which i finished them all and im really waiting now for the rest of the series to be released on PC ... i really find it difficult to find any games as charming as the Yakuza series they are really incomparable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
