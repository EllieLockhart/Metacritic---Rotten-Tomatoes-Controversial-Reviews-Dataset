Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Off the top of my head...Too many jokey gags. First Order and Resistance story line was boring and nonsensical. None of previous movie questions answered. None of the new characters are given much to do or developed past last film (Finn\\, Poe\\, Phasma\\, Snoke). Luke is ruined without any reason that would match his past actions. His whole story seems contrived in order to just not give fans what they wanted. Everything seemed to be done to justify the next movie having zero to do with originals and not really telling a good story. Just terrible. They could have made a bad movie and still had hope for a good final episode nine but they did everything possible to ruin not just the last film but the original trilogy. This was just bad. When every scene with Finn could have been removed and it would not have mattered\\, that is a horrible movie.","true":true}
