Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This story actively dismantles everything Episode 7 was building towards. They just dismiss all valid criticism of this movie saying they just had to change. Was very poorly done and a big disappointment on many fronts.","true":true}
