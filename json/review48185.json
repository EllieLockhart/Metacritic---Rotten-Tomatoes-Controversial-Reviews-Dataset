Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually stunning\\,  the plot holes\\, illogic\\, and scenes of petty revenge makes the movie less than enjoyable. On particular scene\\, which will go unnamed was meant to be touching\\, but came off as stupid and laughable. Very few people at the showing I went to actually said they would recommend it to a friend.","true":true}
