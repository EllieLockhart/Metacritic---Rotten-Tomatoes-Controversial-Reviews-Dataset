We're so used to a world of videogames focused on brainless blind-button-mashing-murder\\, that is refreshing when certain games bring about the oportunity to reflect - reminding me of Undertale in this subject.\rDue to the gameplay\\, for about 80% of the game it felt like a solid 8\\, 8.5\\, but the final stretch was just devastating\\, surely a game i won't ever forget. This not only expands on the legacy of the first game\\, but sets a new standard for the series\\, and for video game storytelling and acting in general.\r\rPS. All you whiny kids who didnt play the game\\, or cant handle the fact gender issues are a fact of life\\, or feel entitled to have your perspective on these characters persist in your fantasies\\, go write fan fiction\\, and not metacritic reviews. Of go play CoD and just give up on growing up. Anyone giving this game less than a 7 is acting in bad faith - the game is bugless\\, the gameplay is at the very least enjoyable\\, the acting is top-notch and the writing is phenomenal (NO EXPOSITION PEOPLE\\, OMG)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
