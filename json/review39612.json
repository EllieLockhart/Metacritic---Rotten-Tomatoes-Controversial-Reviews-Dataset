Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this had soo much potential and there are some good things\\, but there are too many mistakes.  The whole plot line involving Finn and Rose going to the casino\\, useless.  Rey becoming a Jedi but not having any training....Seriously???  Luke just giving up and refusing to train Rey????\/","true":true}
