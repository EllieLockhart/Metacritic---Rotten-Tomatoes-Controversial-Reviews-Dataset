Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nobody seems to get the whole theme of The Last Jedi. The theme is about failure. What the film is trying to tell us is that every one fails or makes mistakes or gives up at some point in their lives. Poe failed to keep the fleet safe even though the Resistance took down a Dreadnought\\, Finn and Rose failed to see DJ\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s true intentions\\, Rey failed to redeem Ben Solo\\, Luke failed to see how strong Snoke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s influence was on Ben. But it was Luke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s sacrifice that gave the Galaxy hope to fight the First Order in the future. Was Luke wrong to try and kill Ben? Yes\\, but he couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t do it. Ben was still family. Perhaps one day when the fanboys have a niece and nephew who look up to you\\, you\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)ll know what it means to love your family\\, and not look for every lame plot hole as an excuse to hide your foul behavior behind. Failure teaches us to get back up on our feet and try again\\, no matter what obstacles are in the way.","true":true}
