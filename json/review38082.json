Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The storylines of this movie are just plain bad.  I was hoping for something special but it came off like a bad Goosebumps plot. Contrived\\, simplistic\\, juvenile.  Visually very satisfying.  But there has to be a story that is somewhat plausible - and it was lacking.","true":true}
