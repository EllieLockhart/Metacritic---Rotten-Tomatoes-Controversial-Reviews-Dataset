Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie can only be considered the worst Star Wars movie of all time!! Kylo kills snoke! Who even are these people? It is a multicultural Marxist feminist soap opera for leftist tumblr audiences. Luke Skywalker dies in the end and gets replaced with a strong womyn. Kill whitey! Kill the boer! Kill all men! This is the message of this Disney trash! If you are a white European you should boycott Hollywood forever.","true":true}
