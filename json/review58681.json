Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of Us 2 is a visually stunning and exciting game that could have been a straight 10\/10 if not for the writers sacrificing a solid plot for the sake of a forced LGBT narrative. And I think this is quite poorly integrated and so detracts from the flow that was created in the first game. My annoyance at story elements in the game was such that I was inclined to want to score it 0\\, but while Joel is disappointingly killed early on\\, his and Ellie\u2019s story is continued through flashbacks which are poignant. If they wanted to create an LGBT narrative it may have worked well in a subsequent title\\, but largely throwing the Joel and Ellie narrative in the bin in favour of new characters who we are set up to despise from the outset was a poor creative choice by Naughty Dog. It\u2019s comparable to killing Daniel Larusso or Rocky off in the sequels to their classic movies and expecting us to enjoy watching the rest when it\u2019s about characters that killed our heroes - it would make no sense and would kill all hope and desire for subsequent instalments.In terms of scoring this\\, I gave 5\/5 for the graphics\\, game mechanics\\, and level design. For the story I give it 2\/5 since it\u2019s like a heavily diluted version of that which I eagerly anticipated and expected. Still\\, the devs made an extraordinary amount of money from this game and so perhaps they don\u2019t mind having thrown their credibility in the toilet. I will not be watching the upcoming series nor playing any more games from this company.Oh well. The first game was great.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
