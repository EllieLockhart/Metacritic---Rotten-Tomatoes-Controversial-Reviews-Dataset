Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Franchise killer. Too many characters\\, too many subplots and a lot of characters that did nt contribute to the story. I don't see how they can save episode 9. I don't really care about the remaining characters. . Hopefully though they don't CGI princes laya or recast .\\n\\nOne and  half stars for the spectacular visual effects.","true":true}
