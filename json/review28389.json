Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the worst movie of the millennium. Most of what the characters did was pointless and the rest was stupid. Everything set up in the Force Awakens to have a grand reveal in The Last Jedi was thrown away. Awkward forced humor inserted throughout that was way too out of place. Pointless cameos that do nothing. Iconic characters completely unrecognizable or not utilized. Does nothing to advance the story\\, can be completely skipped and forgotten. There is literally zero need to watch this before watching episode IX\\, AVOID!!","true":true}
