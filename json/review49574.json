Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow\\, just wow! such a different story than what I was anticipating. crazy how much had changed Luke's life. I loved the character development overall. the amount of action and all the stories left me exhausted. I had to see out twice just too absorb it all a fully embrace the storylines. the gambling planet story needed work and the chase left a little to be desired but it was a great addition. too bad we won't see the original stories with Leia.","true":true}
