Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life Long Star Wars fan\\, I thought I knew what was coming in this latest episode. So maybe that is where I feel left wanting more? It was an action packed thrill ride that went where no Star Wars movie has gone before. It could have been better and more tight from a storytelling perspective\\, but it sets up a third movie that has a lot to conclude","true":true}
