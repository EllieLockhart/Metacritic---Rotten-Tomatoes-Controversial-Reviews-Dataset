Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Updated to 1 star so rating will be counted)\\nThis movie is so bad its not worth the 10 page wall of text which could be written on it. Terrible script writing\\, inconsistencies\\, no character development or progression\\, technical problems\\, and they basically tear down and take a dump on everything Star Wars in the original trilogy.  Also the amount of leftist political propaganda was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Good side is all run by strong faultless females who emasculate their idiot males\\, bad side is all white male Nazi types. Stupid. Pretty much bad everything except the graphics. Who approved this nonsense?","true":true}
