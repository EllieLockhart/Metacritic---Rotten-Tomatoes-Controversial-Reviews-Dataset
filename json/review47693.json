Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw this film\\, my brain was overloaded with thoughts and emotions\\, that I couldn't  assess how I truly feel upon first viewing. Once I saw the film the second time\\, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I am still thinking about scenes and themes in The Last Jedi. I can't wait to see the movie again. I think if fans let go of their expectations and enjoy the film as presented\\, they could get more enjoyment out of it. I don't understand the whole fan backlash. I read that Rian Johnson\\, the director\\, got threats on Twitter from fans. Geez\\, people  - it's just a movie. No need to threaten people because you think he \\\"ruined your childhood\\\". Now I can see why George Lucas bowed out of Star Wars after the Prequels. The fan base can such rabid A-holes.","true":true}
