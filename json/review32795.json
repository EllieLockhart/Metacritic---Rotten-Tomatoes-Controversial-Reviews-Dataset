Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars:  The Last Jedi\\, was a visually astounding film.

If I'd never seen another Star Wars film\\, and saw this as a stand alone film I'd have easily given this a 5 star rating.\\n\\nHowever\\, it is NOT a stand alone film\\, it is part of a vast series of films all interconnected to one another.  With characters that are ingrained in pop culture history\\, who have become legends in their own right.  And this movie kicks those characters in the face\\, and kicks the fans in the face.
