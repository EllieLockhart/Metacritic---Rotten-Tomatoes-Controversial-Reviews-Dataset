Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film lacks all seriousness for itself and destroys the integrity for all previous movies before it.\\n\\nCharacter assassination\\, blatant copy and pasting ideas from the original trilogy and an obvious attempt to push a political message which should not be done on the big screen.\\n\\nWhat hurts most is I booked two tickets to see this movie before seeing it!!! What a waste of time and money.","true":true}
