{"101487":132016,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could split this movie into two separate films\\, one of them would be a really good movie while the other would not be worth watching. Luke and Rey replaying the dynamic between Yoda and Luke from Ep. 5 was fantastic: funny\\, yet insightful\\, and refreshing where it branched away from the Ep. 5 version\\, but comforting where it followed the same path as the old story. Kylo Ren's development with Snoke and Rey was also great. The major twist completely took me by surprise and Kylo and Rey's relationship has a lot of natural potential moving forward. I'm excited to see where their stories go in the next film.\\n\\nI'm not at all excited to see anything more about Poe\\, Finn\\, or the struggle between the Resistance and the First Order. First of all\\, Poe somehow flies his X-Wing in such a way that everyone else (friend or foe) looks like they're either completely incompetent or operating antiquated and faulty equipment. With the feats he's able to pull off\\, the Resistance ought to just send him on a series of one-man-missions and let him kill everyone. When Anakin and Luke from the previous trilogies jumped into their spacecraft\\, you knew that they were great pilots\\, but you never felt like they could go single-handedly win a war video-game-style. Poe feels stupidly overpowered in that regard but the movie seems to imply that his character flaws are supposed to act as a counterbalance to his incredible skills\\, as they sit him in a corner for the rest of the story until he learns his lesson (a painful process wherein progress cannot be observed at all until he experiences his epiphany near the end of the movie). \\n\\nMeanwhile Poe's bff Finn has almost no screen time with him. Granted\\, the blossoming of their relationship in 'The Force Awakens' felt completely superficial and rushed\\, and there is no meaningful passage of time between TFA and 'Jedi' for them to have cemented their bond; so it wouldn't have felt like anything was missing at all if the two characters didn't act like the oldest of friends in their brief moments together in both films . . . but they do act like old friends\\, so I did feel the lack of their actual time together.\\n\\nInstead of hangin' with Poe\\, Finn goes off on a silly\\, and ultimately fruitless\\, adventure that feels awkward at multiple points - and not just because of the fast-flourishing romance with his new friend\\, Rose (I guess something about Finn's face makes people feel like they've known and cared about him for a long time\\, thus he forms these deep bonds with people he's only just met). \\n\\nDuring his adventure with Rose\\, Finn also gets to showcase his extensive knowledge of literally everything in the First Order (this dude must have personally master-minded all of their Doomsday weapons and planet-sized spaceships\\, because he seems to know all of the important facts and weaknesses about each of them) and is able to kill (I think) his old nemesis Captain Phasma . . . largely because her legion of storm troopers all inexplicably disappear off-screen.  But then again\\, with her laser-proof armor (why don't they all wear that armor? Or at least all of the officers? Or anyone else? Ever?) she might have survived to plague us all in the next movie.\\n\\nWe shouldn't worry too much about our heroes in the Resistance\\, though. Despite the fact that the First Order seems to have an inexhaustible wealth of ships\\, personnel\\, and weapons stashed away in the remote reaches of the uncharted space whence they hail\\, our heroes just realized that you can launch a single ship into hyperspace aimed at the enemy to decimate their capital ships and surrounding vessels.  Sacrificing a single ship and its captain (because sending a droid or putting it on auto-pilot would be silly) in exchange for multiple larger enemy vessels and (probably?) tens of thousands of enemy personnel seems like a good way to even the odds of any war. Like I said\\, not worth watching.","true":true}
