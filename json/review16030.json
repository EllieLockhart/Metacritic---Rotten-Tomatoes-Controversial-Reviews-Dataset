Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan. Loved Force Awakens!\\nThis movie however was clearly written by someon who in spite of all the lavish praise and heaps of comments about how this is \\\"THE GUY\\\"!\\, he just didn't get it. He clearly set out to write a very different and unexpected at every turn Star Wars. He succeeded how different didn't equal good. \\nHe blew almost every interest with regard to plot left over from Force Awakens. The biggest crime honestly is that he managed to execute all the most climactic parts in a way that were anything but climactic. Had to ask myself\\nWait.....did that person just die? Not exactly a sign of an experienced director. Disney better rethink a new trilogy with him at the helm. \\nLastly\\, Disney is pushing this Cell phone game. You see a commercial for it prior to movie. Theme of \\\"you can be any character you want in Star Wars just believe!\\\" Then at the very end of the movie it's some Random kid believing in the Force. Just stupid. A total obvious marketing tie in. Dumb. \\nNo interest in seeing next movie.","true":true}
