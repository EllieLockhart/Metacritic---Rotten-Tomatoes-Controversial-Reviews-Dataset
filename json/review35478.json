Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi features a mixture of childish comic relief\\, now a sad trademark of Hollywood blockbusters\\, and missed opportunities. The eight episode of the epic saga fails to connect to the original trilogy in both in atmosphere and continuity. Rian Johnsons attempt to create something unique in a universe already guided by established lore fails to impress\\, in every way.","true":true}
