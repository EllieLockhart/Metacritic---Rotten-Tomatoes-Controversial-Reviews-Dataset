Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ruined Star Wars. How you train in 2 days? Kylo trained for years and yet some newbie is better than him. You know its bad when even Luke Skywalker says it himself. Worst 3rd act in the franchise. Dont know how Disney let this thing happen.","true":true}
