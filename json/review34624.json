Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The character assassination of Luke was unforgivable. The space chase was boring and unbelievable. Finn and Rose rescued animals but left the slaves behind\\, Holdo stayed behind to fly a ship in a straight line.....in space. Reys parents were.....nobody. Snoke was.....nobody. The Knights of Ryn were....nobody. The movie plot holes were LEGION. The film was junk cleverly disguised as a Science Fiction film","true":true}
