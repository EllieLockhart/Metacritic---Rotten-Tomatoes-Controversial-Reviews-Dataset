Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was certified shit. Rose's subplot added nothing to the movie\\, you could have cut her scenes entirely\\, and the plot would be completely unaffected. Luke's character was absolutely obliterated. The movie also teased Kylo and Rey's transition to opposite sides of the force only to cop out\\, making them weaker antagonists and protagonists respectively. On the whole a step back for star wars\\, at least we can ignore the prequels\\, but this is a very scary direction for star wars.","true":true}
