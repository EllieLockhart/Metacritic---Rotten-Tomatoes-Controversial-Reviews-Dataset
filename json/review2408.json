Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very ambitious movie perhaps too ambitious.  The movie felt a bit conflicted trying to hold onto the past while moving in another direction.  The conflict showed up in vignettes like the one between Ray and Luke on the island.  That might be a way to describe the movie as more a collection of vignettes.  I give it four stars because the director didn't have the courage to go the whole distance in another direction if that was his intent.  If one knows the Star Wars cannon there are reminders of the original trilogy throughout the movie.  There are good performances thoughout the movie especially by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.  Those two were the emotional focus of the movie in my opinion.  Do I recommend it?  Yes but it won't feel as satisfying because of the thematic conflict in the movie.","true":true}
