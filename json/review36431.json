Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most mature Star Wars movie that totally defied the expectations of all diehard fans. If you can look beyond the surface you will see a beautifully crafted story that pays homage to the original trilogy and laying the path for the future.","true":true}
