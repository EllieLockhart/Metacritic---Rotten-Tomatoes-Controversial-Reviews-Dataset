{"101487":189049,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is terrible. Rian Johnson seemed to just want a big budget sci-fi movie. Didn't know or understand characters and mythology. Turned his back on everything TFA built up and ruined the entire trilogy. Only way ep9 can be saved is if Luke wakes up from a dream that was ep8.","true":true}
