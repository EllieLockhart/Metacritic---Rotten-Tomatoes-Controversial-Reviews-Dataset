Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really great addition to the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson did a great job of continuing the story while also adding in a new voice and a unique visual style that helps it stand on it's own. Ultimately it sets the stage for a great Episode 9!","true":true}
