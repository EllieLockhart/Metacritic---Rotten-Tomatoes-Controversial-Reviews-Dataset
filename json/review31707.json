Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So sad\\, so disappointed. Now I wish we could\u2019ve been treated to Lucas\u2019s original vision of the final trilogy. As flawed as the prequels were they told a story I wanted to know and ultimately paid off entertainment and story wise. Maul\\, Qui\u2019Gon\\, Windu\\, Tyrannus\\, young Kenobi and Skywalker\\, were many times more interesting and likeable than Rey\\, Ren\\, Snoke and other forgettables. This sad entry follows a lukewarm Force Awakens and degrades what little was good about that movie. TLJ also commits the cardinal sin of ruining Luke Skywalker whose anticlimactic redemption is jawdroppingly hollow trickery after spending most of the movie cynical and sulking. TLJ is head scratchingly the worst Star Wars Movie with arguably the highest production value. Shame since Rogue One brought to me \u201cA New Hope\u201d in terms of Star Wars movies. ","true":true}
