Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filme ruim de mais\\, igual ao epis\u00f3dio 5\\, muito decepcionante pois podiam fazer uma nova hist\u00f3ria\\, mas n\u00e3o\\, eles n\u00e3o t\u00eam coragem de fazer algo novo.","true":false}
