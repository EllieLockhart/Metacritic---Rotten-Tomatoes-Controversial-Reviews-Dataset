Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think I've ever been more sad about giving a review\\, in fact I'm giving 2 stars (not 1) for this review just because I love Star Wars\\, as the actors all tried their best.  I just wanted this to be so much more.  Like many I think there were definitive plot holes\\, but I was more disappointed because this could have been overcome\\, given the excellent acting\\, with just a few tweaks of the story\\, and at least one decent light saber battle.  I also felt the ending was horribly anticlimactic for a 2nd in line star wars movie.  While there were some clever easter eggs\\, there was really no big cliffhanger and\/or big reveal\\, and that is the hallmark of star wars.  After Force Awakens\\, I was on such a high\\, and couldn't wait for what happens next.  Now I really don't care what happens next\\, partially because I already know its\\, SPOILER\\, Kylo vs. Rey... AGAIN.  But what was probably most frustrating for me was how the Finn character was treated.  After a great character set-up\/arc in Force Awakens\\, he had absolutely zero development\/build\\, including going nowhere with what appeared to be the makings of another Jedi as a counter to Rey.  I mean Jesus they opened this series in Force Awakens\\, with HIS awakening in the force\\, then went nowhere with it in Last Jedi.  His exploits with Rose ultimately and frustratingly prove completely pointless.  I'm just frustrated that what appeared to be a co-lead in the series with Rey\\, and thus a first diverse lead in Star Wars\\, was turned into a bit part character.  Don't know if this is part of the Hollywood diversity problem in general\\, as directors (writers notwithstanding) who have these controls\\, have been the ones to push the White characters into position to ultimately save the day\\, with the diverse characters playing the joking\/helper side-kick type parts.  Even Poe was given hero status in a few different ways\\, as opposed to Finn who failed twice to do what he attempted in trying to save the \\\"resistance\\\".  Given the change in directors I wonder if that was the issue\\, and if maybe Abrams can bring some of the magic back to this once promising character\\, and overall series arc.","true":true}
