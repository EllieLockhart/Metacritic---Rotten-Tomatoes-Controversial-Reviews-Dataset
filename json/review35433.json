Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi could have been a good Star Wars movie. It was not. All of the parts were there\\, but they could not connect because pointless plot contrivances got in the way. \\n\\nMost of the Resistance dies because Finn got a parking ticket and hired the wrong guy because he met him in space jail? Right. \\n\\nLeia can space jesus walk back to an airlock while Akbar dies offscreen? Ok.\\n\\nLuke dies from being tired after a force-Skype call? Why not?\\n\\nSnope dies from bad peripheral vision? Cool.\\n\\nPhasma dies from Finn riding an elevator? Go ahead.\\n\\nChewie doesn't eat a roasted Porg? NO. This is unacceptable.  Porgs can be both cute and delicious. \\n\\nThis could have been a streamlined movie about space battles and friends helping each other in their darkest moments. Instead it is Monaco Cat-Horse racing\\, friend betraying\\, pratfall having\\, pile of Star Wars themed comedy sketches.","true":true}
