Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie because fanboys went insane the day it came out ranting about how different it was.  I thought Rogue One was kind of dull and The Force Awakens was more fun but uninspired.  This movie ain't perfect but at least its trying.","true":true}
