The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I give the combay system and the overall gameplay a whopping 9 out of 10. But the story?  Was meh. Ellie and Joel's story has so much potential\\, yet it was sacrificed just to introduce another character and transition her as the new main character. Sorry\\, but I will not play any sequel with Abby as the main chacter.The game horrendously failed to make us sympathize with Abby\\, even though we played as her for 12 freakin hours. Are you kidding me? Neil Druckman's marketig lies caught us off guard. And he's wonder why he's got too many backlash and threats because of this? Of course you would. Imagine how many psychopaths u made by creating this game a source of depression. With literally no tone of happiness. Each scene in the game makes you depressed and angry. Imagine having a rough day\\, having anxiety or depression\\, then you turn on the one thing that's made you happy during your worst times: playing video games. You bought your favorite one which is TLOU 2 and come across this shht. Would someone who is mentally unhealthy\\, act calmly? After u made a mess of the game? You know gamers in asia finished this game only once then sold it to other for half the price. Neil\\, I don't think it's right that you're having threats\\, but buddy\\, you had this coming. You said trust you and you will do right by us? What the sht was that. Unsatisfying\\, distatesful and a failed attempt to try something new. In the future\\, I would certainy think twice before buying another druckman written game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
