Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Laura Dern tried to tell every1 to stay home despite the 93% joke rating by Rot Tomatoes. She said she was such a fan of the franchise that she couldn't help saying pew pew when the blaster guns were firing away. Beyond Ross Douthat in Nat'l Review\\, pew pew is the most honest Return of the Jedi review you're going to get. Douthat & the conservative Nat Review rated it pew pew too. This stupid movie even managed to make Dern look ridiculous as the resistance Vice Admiral. Resist the Cognitive Dictatorship that tells you how wonderbar this piece of crap is supposed to be.","true":true}
