Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this entry doesn't fall into expectations on the second viewing I found I enjoyed it greatly. One of the major changes with the EU and Canon with the Sequel trilogy and standalone films is you really have to take in everything to have a feel for what's going on.\\n\\nLyra Erso dying in the beginning of Rogue One was far more impactful if you had read the Canon novel \\\"Catalyst\\\" where she's a major character. The same can be said for the major\\, and visually stunning\\, climax with the fleet. If you have read some of the novels\\, especially Leia\\, you know these characters and their motivations.\\n\\nThis lifelong Star Wars fan\\, who suffered through Jar Jar and farting camels in Episode 1\\, appreciates Rian Johnson not bowing to expectations and making what we thought we knew about the Force not even close. It sets up a possible future where anything goes and I\\, for one\\, welcome that. No one wants to see every expectation in a trilogy revealed midway.","true":true}
