Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It was such a beatiful game... little details and all\\, so gorgeous it was insane\\, I get what you tried to do Neil\\, but Im afraid I didnt get nearly the same feeling I did from the first\\, I waited awhile for this game  and gave you guys the benefit of the doubt when all this stuff was coming out on youtube\\, but it just didnt do it\\, it was tear jerking at the end because of everything that was going on but it left me with a  confused mind\\, I just didnt see the same energy that the first one had\\, I may be trippin or somethin. Neil it was a great game\\, I see the direction you tried to go with but it was just the writers\\, too many moments I had where I didnt give a fk about the other side of characters and felt it was just there so you would feel bad about what the future holds for a certain individual\\, but you have to understand nobody actually sees this reality because you're only one person\\, nobody knows what someone else went through to get them into the position they are in at the moment\\, so the whole guilt trip thing doesnt feel right especially \\\"near\\\" the ending. Its a well thought out game but  I just feel like it was TOO thought out instead of being the  game it shouldve been\\, the story couldve been SOOOO much better\\, but I guess what the maker makes\\, is what we take.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
