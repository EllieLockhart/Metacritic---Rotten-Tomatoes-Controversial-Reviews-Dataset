Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(This was from my Google review)\\nI just watched the force awakens\\, and the last Jedi in preparation for the rise of skywalker. I can't believe just how bad this movie is. As a star wars film\\, as an action film\\, writing-wise\\, and storytelling. On these levels\\, it's awful just awful. I actually liked force awakens. Its humor reminded me of men in black\\, the action was great\\, visually the film is beautiful. It set up so many potentials for a great sequel. Sadly\\, the last Jedi is not a great\\, good\\, or even fair sequel. It killed any and all potential for this new trilogy. R.I.P Star Wars You will be loved\\, remembered\\, and cherished forever.","true":true}
