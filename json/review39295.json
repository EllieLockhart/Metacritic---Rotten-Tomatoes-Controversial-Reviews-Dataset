Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a corporate exploitational cash-grab. Sure\\, that's always been Star Wars's gimmick to some degre\\, but this has the writing structure of a Disney Channel TV movie. Pandering to the wallets of next generations is clearly more important than telling a decisive and thoughtful story. Critics must have some kind of financial incentive to praise this film the way they have\\, because anyone with a decent idea of what a well-structured story is can see how cringe-inducing this mess is. As a viewer\\, I feel condescended.","true":true}
