Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even with a few flaws (e.g.  Camto Bight) I really feel that  The Last Jedi  is one of the best scripted\\, acted and thematically interesting movie of the all the films to date. I laughed at most of the jokes\\, I shed unexpected tears and most importantly I  could never guess how the story was unfolding. It kept me riveted even through so\\,e of the slower parts. Definitely worth watching and see it in the theaters if you can!","true":true}
