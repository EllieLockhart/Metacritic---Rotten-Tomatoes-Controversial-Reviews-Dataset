Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not as bad as what people say it is. Yes\\, it is disappointing how little it gave to us\\, but it's really just harmless. It has good humor for the family\\, and it once again gives some great visuals for us\\, but it really doesn't have anything else. It's not offensive or anything\\, it's just that the movie just takes it safe and there's really not anything else to it. Really the only major problem I have with it is the messy exposition with introducing each character\\, like the movie spends about 15 minutes getting the movie ready when there's not much to begin with. Again\\, not offensive\\, just harmlessly disappointing.","true":true}
