Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The picture lacks the soul and vision of the originals while overly relying on effects and established tropes to tell a story. The triumphant Star Wars score & flavor meets nihilistic writing and direction which leaves us with confused faces and a tone deaf end result. It seeks the approval of the academy and the mainstream critics by incorporating token and contrived geopolitcal perspectives as a substitute for proper character developement and story arc.","true":true}
