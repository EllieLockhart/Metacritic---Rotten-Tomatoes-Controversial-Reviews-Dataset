Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has extremely good moments\\, but it cannot get through bad plot choices\\, annoying characters and the general feeling that this movie had all the ingredients for being extremely good and failed spectacularly in the cooking.","true":true}
