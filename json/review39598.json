Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This franchise is creatively bankrupt. Disney will continue to miss the point of Star Wars because they are trying to turn the movies into Marvel Style action movies. Rian was simply trolling his audience\\, Disney cares more about searing Political Correctness and their ideologies into your kids brains instead of delivering a satisfying star wars experience. Disney will continue to violate the franchise to death\\, until no one cares about star wars\\, and that will happen way sooner than they expect.","true":true}
