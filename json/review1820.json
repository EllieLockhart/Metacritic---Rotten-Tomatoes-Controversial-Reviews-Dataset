{"101487":105503,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As big fan of the Star Wars saga\\, who grew up watching the other two trilogies\\, I was very excited about this \\\"new tone\\\" that TLJ would bring to the galaxy.\\nRian Johnson's Lopper was promising and JJ Abrams had already quite successfully created foundations for the next instalment of the saga. Characters have already been established and stakes have spiralled. A new\\, mysterious and exciting villain came to the stage\\, Kylo Ren was supposed to finish his training and Rey was supposed to start one of her own with the only surviving Jedi Master.\\nAnd the expression \\\"supposed to\\\" defines this movie. What plotlines have been established in TFA were almost immediately dropped in TLJ. There would be no harm in that but the way it was done did not do the characters justice. Without getting into too much detail Snoke feels complete pointless to the overall plot. Luke doesn't even resemble the Luke we used to know and without any proper backstory there is no reason ROTJ Luke would do the things he had done here. Not to mention the slap-on-the-face joke. Comedy in this movie is altogether tasteless\\, tactless and completely immersion breaking to a degree it requires a separate section.\\nFurthermore\\, the mystery surrounding Rey's parents has been just thrown out the window. And with all of this missing what are we left with? The Disney Jedi Cinderella (or DJC) is one of the worst major characters in SW that I have seen so far. Even Jar Jar\\, however annoying he can be\\, had a better story. Like with Rey\\, Kylo Ren's\\, Finn's and Poe's characters have been totally wasted. Not to mention Maz Kanata's cameo which looks like it was shoehorned in there. What are we left with? Holdo has a huge part to play but the conflict which arises do to the role of her character isn't just pointless\\, it's completely illogical. I won't even mention Rose who is just a complete waste of Diversity\/Inclusion and only Social Justice Warriors can be happy about her character. Not only is he poorly written\\, drives a 20 minute pointless plot line which ultimately has no impact on the story at all. Again\\, like many other things in TLJ\\, it feels like Disney is trying to reprogram our minds instead of producing a good movie.\\nTime to change the topic a bit and let's talk about comedy\/comic relief. TLJ tries to do what Marvel has been so proficient at. Deliver an exciting story\\, sometimes dark and serious\\, with little drops of humour which remind us that at the end of the day Iron Man is just a comic book hero. It not only provides relief but also creates a feeling that the Marvel movies are comic book adaptations and shouldn't be taken too seriously. They are made for fun. Star Wars on the other hand\\, even though a bit of humour has always been there since the original trilogy\\, it never took centre stage and would never\\, I repeat NEVER\\, break immersion. To say the least and keep this text short the scene were Luke casually throws away the light sabre is nothing more than a slap on the face for the audience. Regardless if you are a fan of SW or not. \\nWith this we have arrived at the biggest issue I have with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Its plot just doesn't make sense. The conflict is only crated for conflict's sake and doesn't make any lasting impact on any of the characters. They all survive\\, besides Luke\\, but do we know what the state of the galaxy is? What has really happened to the Resistance\\, where are they at now? And what about the Jedi? All throughout the movie we are told that the old must day\\, Jedi have to end. And do they? Of course not because Ray saves the ancient texts even though Yoda in his little cameo destroys the tree and the books. So are the Jedi gone? Should there be a new way to follow the force? No\\, because in the end Ray saves the books? And Why? Judging by where the story goes it won't even be explained in the final movie.\\nSo are there any good things about the movie? Yes there are. Visuals are stunning\\, fights are amazing but\\, the Space Opera feeling the previous movies had is completely gone. Fans have been left mistreated and I honestly don't see any reason why new fans should appear. I walked around Smyth's Toys in Ireland the other day and found almost none of the toys. And whichever were left had discounted prices less than a year after the movie was released. This just speaks volumes about how successful this movie has been.\\n\\nAnd finally\\, as I am no critic\\, I think critics are wrong about this movie. Not because they aren't fans but they completely miss the point exactly how this movie did. It is just a poor movie. Is it worse than The Attack of the Clones? Just ask the fans and you will see\\, hear and know what the answer is: It is just a poor movie\\, hollow shell which everyone will quickly either forget or want to forget.","true":true}
