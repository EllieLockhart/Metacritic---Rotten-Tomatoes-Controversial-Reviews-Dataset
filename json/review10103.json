Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, bad star wars movie giving it a 50% from me. It was undoubtedly a good movie with some nice humor and good action however\\, it was In my opinion a very poor Star Wars movie giving me the cynical feeling of Disney abandoning the awesomeness of star wars for another kids actions movie just so that they can sell more toys.","true":true}
