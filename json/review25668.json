Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as as well written as the previous one. {Spoilers} The plans made by the Resistance were all built up then later fails and needed ass-pulls and \\\"Deus ex machina\\\" moments to save their situtions. Kylo and Rey's relationship have an awkward turn that didn't seem natural. Fight scenes weren't great. It wasn't a terrible movie but it isn't that good either. 2 and a half out of 5","true":true}
