This is a bold narrative that will challenge you in your beliefs and dive into the complexity of human emotion. This is triumph from the beginning to the end.\r\rThe story worked on every level for me\\, and I understand this is highly subjective. It is very possible that the story does not work for you\\, but i implore anyone that is interested in this game to not buy into the hate vitriol and experience it for yourself if you can.\r\rFrom a gameplay perspective\\, this is an evolution rather than a revolution.

The stealth aspects have been tweaked and it is a blast to play through encounters\\, despite the bleakness and violence of this world.\r\rI have a few gripes\\, with the length of the game being a small issue. I do believe that the last few combat encounters were one too many\\, and the game could have had a more laser focused narrative at the end. On easier difficulties\\, enemy AI can be a bit simple\\, but I think playing on hard and above gives you a real challenge.\r\rDespite these small issues\\, i have still given this game a perfect score as a i believe full marks in this case is not perfection\\, but rather it recognises what is to my mind a masterpiece\\, and a story that will stick with me for years to come\\, and one that I will discuss and dissect extensively into the foreseeable future.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
