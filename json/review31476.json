Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some serious holes not withstanding\\, this is the best of the third trilogy. Lots of ambitious ideas with a few big misses. Some great character work and an interesting new world plus excellent visuals make this movie solid. Movie would be even better in a vacuum\\, some continuity errors with the rest of the sw universe","true":true}
