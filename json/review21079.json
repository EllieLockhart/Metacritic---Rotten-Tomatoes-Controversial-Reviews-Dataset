Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was six years old when I saw the original Star Wars in the theater in 1977. It's the first movie I can remember seeing\\, and I have been an incorrigible Star Wars fan since then.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars films yet. It's not perfect--it has moments that nearly broke my suspension of disbelief--but I don't understand the hate this film is getting. It is as beautiful as we expect a Star Wars film to be\\, and while the story meanders a bit in places\\, I felt everything came together in a compelling way. It leaves a number of loose ends\\, as is appropriate for the middle act of a trilogy\\, and it hints at a depth to the force that seems to have eluded both the Sith and the Jedi through their entire history. Add to that the best acting and dialogue I can remember in a Star Wars film\\, and I can only describe the experience as phenomenal.\\n\\nGo see the movie before you make a judgment on it. I think you will find as much to love in it as I did.","true":true}
