Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, Abrahams\\, Kennedy and Ryan Johnson destroyed the Skywalker saga that George Lucas built over more than three decades ago....it's so sad to see my favorite saga destroyed by Disney studios........I waited my whole life to watch the sequel trilogy and they totally ruined it! You killed star wars!!!! Disney\\, you suck!! Give the franchise back to George Lucas!","true":true}
