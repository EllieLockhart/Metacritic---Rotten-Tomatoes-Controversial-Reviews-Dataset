Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the hate from the fan base of Star Wars\\, I have only good things to say about this movie. \\nAmazing directions and screen writing\\, excellent acting and character development. \\nSure\\, some parts are weird or pointless ( Snoke dying without us knowing anything of note about his backstory being one). All in all it's still a great movie.  ","true":true}
