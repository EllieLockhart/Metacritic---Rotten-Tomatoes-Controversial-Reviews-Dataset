Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With excellent action scenes\\, but most importantly a different approach with more sophisticated\\, moving and even authentic drama instead of just pure spectacle\\, The Last Jedi truly delivers. The film's structure is familiar and the villain contrivance was just unfortunate and thus I ended up not being too excited for the next chapter\\, but most of the characters got their moment to shine and the highlights include Luke who got his best story yet\\, Snoke who is very menacing and Rose who is highly endearing. The use of intriguing locations and excellent practical effects added a lot of visual flair to the film whereas unexpectedly strong humor\\, great dialogue\\, clever themes and strong emotion all led to what is in my opinion the second best Star Wars film.","true":true}
