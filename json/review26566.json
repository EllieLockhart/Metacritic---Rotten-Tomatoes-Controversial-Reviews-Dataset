Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my god! What a complete load of trash. By far the worst Star Wars film\\, full of plot holes and inconsistencies\\, dumb scenes that don't make sense. Dull characters that add nothing to the plot..(what plot) this movie is so shockinly bad. The storyline is awful\\, the characters have no motivation\\, poinless sub plots\\, it felt like watching a 2hr long trailer\\, it's soo boring. The flying Leia scene was absolutely ridiculous\\, it actually made me laugh out loud it was so stupid. Great effects and sound but no depth whatsoever and such a boring poinless story.","true":true}
