Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The out of place jokes\\, the big logical mistakes of the story\\, the unnecessary Finn&Rose-quest. Its so ridiculous\\, the fact that it has beautiful visuals and the development between Kylo and Ray is brilliant acting are not enough compensation which makes it an overall bad movie in my opinion.","true":true}
