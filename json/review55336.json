Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long\\, boring and not true to the characters.  The worst parts were (1) Poe being a whiney annoying loser who I think by now has killed more members of the resistance than the sith.  (2) Rose and Finn\\, who took two good characters and put them in an irrelevant sjw side mission that slowed down an already terrible movie. And (3) Luke\\, so unfaithful to the original that even Mark Hamill came out against his own performance.  The silver lining that earning it one star is Kylo Ren\\, who continues to be awesome despite the terrible script and even worse directing.","true":true}
