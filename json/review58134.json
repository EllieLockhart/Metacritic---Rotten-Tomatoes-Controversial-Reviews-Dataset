Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Would not recommend for so many reasons. This movie was very poorly written and so many things about it make no sense at all. For sure in the bottom 3 worst Star Wars films\\, if not the worst.","true":true}
