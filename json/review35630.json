Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is a mess of a movie rather than using the force awakens as a springboard for the film the director has decided to have unfunny jokes. \\nI doubt i will see the next film as this film decides to put social justice\\nin the film and tries to make out that if you don't like the film that you are sexist towards women. If you are a fan of the old star wars movies stay far away as what they did to Luke is horrifying.","true":true}
