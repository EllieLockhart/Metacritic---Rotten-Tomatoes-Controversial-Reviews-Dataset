Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has to be the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. I never make reviews\\, but this movie deserves one. Please save your money for anything else and save yourself from being ashamed at what has become of Star Wars.\\nPros:  Great visuals\\, albeit the red was overdone in the movie.\\n\\nCons: Dialogue and humor were contrived and out of touch\\, leading to a very confusing script. \\nCharacter development of the protagonists and antagonists are almost non-existent\\, with the characters either becoming expendable or shells of what they were in The Force Awakens.\\nInstead of Luke coming off as a broken man\\, he became a mockery of his former self resembling a town drunkard.\\nRey's potential in this movie was wasted and instead we have Canto Bight shoved in our face.\\nHux\\, Poe\\, and Finn are bumbling fools compared to the last movie.\\nHoldo was thrown in for no other reason than to have her wasted.\\nVerdict: Rian Johnson should stick to TV series. He has no respect for the name Star Wars\\, butchering what JJ set up for him. This movie seems like it wanted to add suspense but ultimately gives us nothing. I walked out of the theater having no interest in what happens next. There is nothing in this movie that furthered my interest in the new characters\\, ratherer it \\\"killed the past\\,\\\" in the most disrespectful way.","true":true}
