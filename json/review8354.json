Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like a Pirates of the Caribbean movie with the editing choices. The Luke\\, Rey\\, Kylo stuff was Star Wars worthy but the rest was just pointless bloat.  The Finn and Rose angle was especially tedious and ultimately pointless. Only had about one and a half decent battles (Kylo and Rey throne room fight and Luke vs Kylo).","true":true}
