Something happens at the start of the game which is the main plot of the game.it's just not a great opening. I'm sure you know by now you play as a different new character for half of the game\\, which pointless\\, this game could have been wrapped up in 6 hours or so. There's scenes that are just repeated and you have to go through them again and again and again. It really does break my heart to write this\\, but this is probably one of the worst story driven games I've played in a while\\, there's massive plot holes\\, unlikeable characters\\, in some areas it looks very cartoon like\\, i experienced a lot of bugs as well\\, it doors not opening\\, or doors being open but i can't continue the game. It's not a last of us game\\, the fact i paid \u00a370 for the special edition shows how much i was looking forward to this game. It really has let me down\\, I'm so angry at naughty dog as they had so much potential with this but yet they decided to focus half of the game on an entirely different story line and going back and forth in time\\, it's hard to keep up. I replayed the first one at last five times. I've just completed now\\, and i will never play this game again. It's going straight on ebay. Hopefully can recoop some costs from it. Huge disappointment\\, Is it worth a play\\, probably if you like long winded\\, dragged out stories. I will say though the graphics are decent and the accessibility options are amazing\\, so hats off to them for that. I honestly do feel that's the only redeeming feature of this game. I wouldn't recommend buying it full price\\, when it goes on sale. 3\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
