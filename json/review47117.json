Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a let down. characters built from the Force Awakens either died with little flare or sidelined to be more of screen time fillers. No real light saber battles between good and evil & it seems the franchise just want to milk more money from it by doing an extra episode.","true":true}
