Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was pointless and uninspiring. Like a mediocre painter\\, great technique\\, little originality or art. Did the female actors have to be THAT homely? Poor casting and acting\\, poor directing\\, too much gratuitous messaging. The series is dead.  J. J. Abrams is a con artist.","true":true}
