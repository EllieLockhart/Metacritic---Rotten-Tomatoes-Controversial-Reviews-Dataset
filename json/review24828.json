Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My bottom line up front on this is that it ranks somewhere around the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.  It's not a good movie...period.  Not just \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, but \\\"movie\\\"...bad.  It barely advances the story-line we've been following\\, has too many different plot-lines\\, and gives you very little to emotionally invest in any one character\\, save for maybe Luke at very end...but only then and really only for nostalgic reasons.  \\n\\nIt's not that I can't deal with them changing the direction of the saga.  The fact is it's a poorly written movie that is far too long and rather boring.  The various plot lines going on leave you with many head scratchers that simply don't make sense or don't advance the plot.  Way too many stupid\\, campy\\, slapstick jokes.  It's just bad.  Here's a few questions about all this: \\n\\nWhy is the Resistance using carpet-bomb techniques from WWII?  \\n\\nWhy do Finn and Rose have this completely useless side-story? So we can get Rose talking about freeing-horses and how rich people are bad?  If that's a major theme you want to bring out in a movie\\, it would seriously help if you made the audience believe that.  As it is\\, it's choppy at best. \\n\\nWhy in the world do we have to sit through the SLOWEST. CHASE. EVER? I'm really supposed to believe that the First Order doesn't have any ships that can speed up there\\, wipe out the Resistance\\, and move on with their day?  Really?  \\n\\nWhy didn't Holdo share her plan about the escape pods?  What would've been the harm in that?  Absolutely nothing.  There was no operational secrecy that needed to be maintained on that ship.  It was a dumb\\, plot device to make Poe look more like a hothead and attempt to strengthen Holdo's character.\\n\\nSpeaking of Holdo\\, why does she have to go on a suicide mission?  You mean to tell me that they don't have programmable computers on that ship?  I can program my damn coffee maker to turn on at 6am and you can't program a damn ship to go to hyperspace in say\\, 15 minutes?  SMH....\\n\\nLet's move on to Luke's character.  Ok\\, so he has some PTSD problems from his encounter with Kylo back in the day.  Rrrrriiiiggghhttt...because the guy who redeemed his father from the dark side just felt that the right thing to do was to eliminate Kylo when he was being pulled to the dark side.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  Who thinks up this crap?  Moving on\\, he's a hermit\\, possibly suicidal\\, and wants to be left alone.  But then out of nowhere\\, he decides to \\\"teach\\\" Rey...of which we see basically nothing.  If you're going to write that the character is a teacher it might help to actually show some of that.  As it is\\, we're left to believe that Rey is some kind of completely exceptional character in all the history of Force users.  She doesn't need any training\\, she comes fully programmed.\\n\\nThen we have Yoda's cameo where he seems to be more a Muppet from Fraggle Rock than the wizened\\, old Master Jedi who instructed Luke on Dagobah.\\n\\nFinally\\, Kylo and Snoke.  Snoke is shown to us as being this effortlessly powerful master of the Dark Side of the Force\\, capable of reading minds\\, bridging Rey and Kylo's minds (in a weird sort of 'texting' way...whatever)\\, etc.  But then he's easily bisected by Kylo who just sorted sneaks in a little Force use on the lightsaber next to Snoke.\\n\\nAll of this results in one big discombobulated movie that you struggle to sit through for 2.5 hours\\, hoping to God it's going to get better but are ultimately disappointed because it just gets worse.","true":true}
