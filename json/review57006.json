Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They simply could have made this movie better. While decent\\, but still not better than Empire Strikes Back and\\, ironically\\, on par with Return of the Jedi. I simply don't understand the logic of a non-physical form Luke Skywalker going forward. We never got to see Luke Skywalker using a lightsaber as a true Jedi Master and using his full power in the Force. It leads me to ponder if the screenwriters or story writers have any clue about the saga of the Skywalker family.","true":true}
