Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers here.\\nI liked it\\, but it seemed small\\, and slow. The main conflict of the first half of the film was very dull\\, and most of the movie lacked any urgency.\\nI really enjoyed some of the twists and character dynamics\\, and there was one fight scene that was particularly outstanding\\, but I felt like there was too much fat that needed to be trimmed from the script\\, and the tone was messy.\\nI think the biggest problem with this film is that it kept the humor of previous films\\, like The Force Awakens\\, but lacked its heart\\, and its charm. There's also the way Rian Johnson handled Luke in this movie\\, which I wasn't particularly thrilled with\\, and one scene with Leia was probably written for Superman or Star-Lord (if you've seen it\\, you know what I mean).\\nI'll end on a high note\\, Kylo Ren. While I'm not the biggest fan of the whiny dark Force user (See Anakin in ep. 2-3)\\, and I initially got the impression that Adam Driver's performance was based solely off of the Tusken Raider massacre and accompanying monologue\\, he has turned out to be a really interesting character with a gripping screen presence and an epically awesome fighter (Where can I pick myself up a TIE Silencer?). His performance was easily my favorite part of the entire film.\\nI know what I have to do\\, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it to my favorite franchise.\\nThis movie was like a soup with a few absolutely outstanding pieces of meat floating in a cold broth of mediocrity. 6\/10","true":true}
