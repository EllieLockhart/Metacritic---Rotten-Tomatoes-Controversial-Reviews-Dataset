Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars since the original trilogy. The characters introduced in The Force Awakens were tasteless and the only reason they were what they were was P.C. reasons. Rian Johnson saved them. The Last Jedi gives them weaknesses\\, temper and spirit. I could spoil 3 scenes that prove that Rian Johnson clearly understood what made us love Star Wars when we were kids\\, but of course I won't.\\nI'm disappointed to see that J.J. Abrams will direct Episode 9\\, but I'm so happy to know that Johnson will direct an entire trilogy. Since Episode 2\\, I had never imagined that I would see a good Star Wars again in my entire life.\\n\\nThank you Rian Johnson. Thank you.","true":true}
