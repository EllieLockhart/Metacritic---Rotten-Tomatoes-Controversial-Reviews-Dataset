Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think I just watched Space Balls\\, the Search for More Money!   This movie jumped the shark and nuked the fridge\\, all in a mere 2 hrs and 40 long minutes.  Luke joking around with the Force with Rey?  Leia's resurrection?  Porgs?  And no real answers to all of the questions asked in Force Awakens.  The more I think about what I just watched the more mad I get.  Fire Rian Johnson and bring back Gareth Edwards.","true":true}
