Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a pointless addition to this franchise. I felt like Abrams had it on the right track. This imbecile ruined it. Snoke dies before we even know who he is and by the idiotic spinning of a lightsaber? What was with all the stupid humor distractions? Luke dies simply because he used the force to project himself? Lukes entire character was horrible. Rey\u2019s costume looked like it was meant for a toddler or she used her salary to support crispy cream. There were wholes throughout the plot. ","true":true}
