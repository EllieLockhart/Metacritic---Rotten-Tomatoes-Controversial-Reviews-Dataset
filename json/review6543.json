Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does it live up to the pre-release hype\\, that this might be the best Star Wars movie ever made? No\\, not at all. It's decent film compared to the rest of the series\\, and a good movie overall. It feels a little unfocused at times\\, but there the climactic moments are wonderful and help make up for the discombobulation.  I feel like many of the fans are saying they didn't like it\\, because it was hyped up so much and when critics say something is on par with the Empire Strikes Back\\, it can be hard not to be disappointed when it fails to deliver anything other than a masterpiece of the ages.","true":true}
