Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So far this new trilogy is only marginally better than the prequel one. The only decent bit here was Luke's story arc. The subplot is pointless and there are several truly cringe-worthy moments (ie. the kiss). As usual\\, the humour is humourless\\, its overrun with pointless creatures purely there so they can sell toys and its crammed with more SJW signalling than a Berkeley Politics class. And most criminal of all\\, Darth Vader's successor is a wimp.\\n\\\"Yoda: The greatest teacher\\, failure is.\\\"","true":true}
