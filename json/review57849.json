Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weak plot\\, some things defy logic.   Don't want to give away any spoilers so will not be more specific.  If you are a fan of Star Wars\\, like I have been since when I was a kid in the 1980's\\, this might not be the movie for you.","true":true}
