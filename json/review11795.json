Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How many consistency mistakes can you make? Probably cuased by focus on historic stars\\, story lines and xsucce sfators which do not work any more\\, at least not for me. So strange that this clumsy movie with overacting actors gets such high scores here.","true":true}
