Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People just cannot take the fact that a nobody can be a somebody. Why in this vast universe should every single new character be connected to one another. The last jedi is a spectacular film that takes a more emotional and philosophical look at the force and the jedi. If someone expects to see luke as his casual self from return of the jedi you will be disappointing. Because there is such a thing as character development. After Lukes order fell do you expect him to be casual and not a hater for the jedi. He blames himself for the fall of it and then he learns that the best way to teach is to teach when you fail so others will not repeat the same mistake. Finally realize that this is 30 years after Return of the jedi\\, so when did leia learn... Idk probably in between\\, everything does not need to be answered at once.","true":true}
