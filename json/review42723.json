Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great\\, definitely better than The Force Awakens. I don't understand the hate for this movie\\, people simply can't handle change. This film was much more interesting and exciting than The Force Awakens. The reviews fans are giving this movie are ridiculous.","true":true}
