Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to see almost all male roles emasculated and every male lead killed off in anti climatic scenes this may just be the movie for you.\\n\\nWatch the Skywalker mythos degenerate into Luke considering to kill a child.\\n\\nWe also have Finn who can't do anything heroic because a women who he just met got a crush on him and kissed him in the first couple of hours meeting him; can anyone say butterflies?\\n\\nWatch purple hair Kamikaze lady who needs no introduction because the writers were just to lazy to write a backstory crash a ship after she causes a massacre.\\n\\nAlso watch Leia transform into space Jesus\\, can anyone say Girl Power!?\\n\\nPS movie was garbage. disney\\, just give Star Wars back to Lucas and apologize for turning Star Wars into feminist porn.","true":true}
