Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in the direction Rian Johnson has taken. What was the point of ANYTHING that happened in TFA now? \\n\\nVisually\\, it is an amazing film\\, and as a stand alone film with no backstory\\, it is great.  But as an entry into one of the most hallowed sci-fi franchises ever\\, it felt like a giant middle finger to everything that had come before it.","true":true}
