Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage.... thank god JJ\u2019s coming back for episode 9\\, hopefully D&D who were just hired to do new Star Wars series will be Rian Johnson\u2019s replacement for that trilogy he was supposed to be doing. Disney can\u2019t ignore the fans\\, we want no more of Johnson\u2019s total mess of a story and plot that makes no sense and horribly timed humor and silly directing. Carrie Poppins... worse scene in Star Wars history. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb","true":true}
