Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have already seen \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" three times\\, and I loved it more after each viewing. Don't listen to the haters; while no movie is perfect\\, this one comes close. There are several scenes that are so beautifully shot\\, it will leave you stunned. The character arcs\\, dialogue\\, and skill of the actors are all incredible. The action\\, score\\, effects\\, and costumes are gorgeous. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I sat on the edge of my seat with my hands glued to my cheeks. It was intense and action-packed\\, and well balanced between nostalgia and newness. Kids and adults alike will love this film. I can't wait to see it again!","true":true}
