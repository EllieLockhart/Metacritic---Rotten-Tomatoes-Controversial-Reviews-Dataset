Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing not only if you are a Star Wars fan but if you like good stories!! The movie makes absolutely no sense. Characters are disposable\\, the plot is pointless and it did nothing else than keep you entertained for 3 and half hours. The whole movie happens around a slow persecution that did not need to happen at all but it was necessary for the other sub plots and the very artificial development of characters like Finn\\, Rose and Poe. Skywalker is dead\\, Leia turned into Marry Poppins but she is dead too\\, Rey has no Jedi training but somehow she is the new generation\\, Kylo is still a crying baby and now the only bad guy\\, Yoda could have literally strike Snoke and Kylo with lighting and finish the movie in two minutes (that is probably what Episode IX will be\\, Luke ghost-appearing striking with thunder everyone). Overall\\, this movie was very disappointing and seemed improvised. Worst Star Wars movie ever (yes\\, worse than phantom menace).","true":true}
