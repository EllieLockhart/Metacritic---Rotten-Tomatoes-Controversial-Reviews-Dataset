Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow what a let down!  This film delivers disappointment at every turn.\\nIt starts with the shockingly cheesy scene of PL using the force and floating to space after being blown up.\\nNext a lead character dies with no apparent reasoning.\\nThen the character we've all waited to see is a recluse and the big comeback never actually comes and he just fades away.\\nThere is 40 minutes of film in a casino which carries no purpose whatsoever.\\nWe also lose another semi important character again with no epic ending or build up of the character.\\n overall this film achieved absolutely nothing\\, it's a complete waste of time and a waste of two hours by the time I left the theatre I felt it built nothing on the previous installment and when the next chapter comes out I will probably be able to have watched one and three and completely missed this film and still know what's going on.","true":true}
