Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The writing was bad but technically this game is a masterpiece. Good acting\\, but character\u2019s actions are inconsistent with anything we have learned in zombie apocalypse media and even TLOU Part I. The idea of \u201ctrust no one and especially strangers\u201d is thrown out the window. All new characters are forgettable and some get killed up so unceremoniously it was laughable like something akin to the Walking Dead TV show.  The only new characters that were redeemable were Abby and Isaac. The latter of which is barely given any character development. Abby\u2019s actor is great and that should not be ignored because of the sub par writing. If you take the writing away\\, this game is great. But when you are doing a sequel to one of the best written games of all time it\u2019s impossible not to consider it in rating this game. I\u2019m glad I played it without having it spoiled for me\\, I think it did help me appreciate some of the story moments more. I believe if you did read the spoilers it will hinder your first experience with the game for sure.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
