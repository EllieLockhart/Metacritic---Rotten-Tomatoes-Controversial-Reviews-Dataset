{"101487":106142,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A surprisingly controversial film\\, but easily one of the best Star Wars films in the franchise. \\n\\nIn Lucasfilm's Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, the Skywalker saga continues as the heroes of The Force Awakens join the galactic legends in an epic adventure that unlocks age-old mysteries of the Force and shocking revelations of the past.\\n\\nSo after seeing this film on the premier night\\, I knew I had to watch this film one more time before making a decisive conclusion on it. After watching it a second time\\, I didn't like it as much as the first time\\, but I still loved this film. I feel like this movie has a lot it can offer its audience\\, while also being something that I thought die-hard Star Wars fans would love. While I realize this film ins't perfect\\, I still genuinely think it's one of the best films of the year.\\n\\nLet's start with the characters \/ acting. Daisy Ridley was still amazing as Rey. Her emotion and her persona work perfectly for the character of Rey\\, making her a perfect choice for the part. I think she easily takes control of the role with not only her acting\\, but everything. She went through immense training to nail the physical art of the role\\, while really nailing that emotional and intellectual aspect. While she was amazing\\, I honestly think the star of the film was Adam Driver. His portrayal of Kylo Ren was more than phenomenal. He's downright scary and mad in this part. He's able to really dig deep into who this character is and he makes a memorable villain. The decision to let him act rather than hide behind a mask was probably one of the best decisions this film made. While both of them did great\\, a lot of credit also has to go to Oscar Isaac and Mark Hamill. They both played much larger roles in this film than the last\\, and they both were able to deliver performances for the better. \\n\\nThe story is really interesting\\, if not constantly thrilling and emotional. I really think that Rian Johnson did a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat for an entire 2 hours and 30 minutes. For such a long runtime\\, it never felt like it dragged or faltered. It was a constant rush of emotion for hours and it always felt like anything could happen at anytime. The characters were always in peril but it actually felt like something could happen to them. It wasn't that thing where the main character is in peril but you know they won't die\\, rather\\, it's the complete opposite. I think that's a really impressive thing to do and I have to give a lot of applause for that. Johnson is a great story teller and while there were still problems with the story\\, I appreciate the direction he took the story in. \\n\\nIn terms of visuals\\, this film was beautiful. There are some gorgeous shots and use of CGI in this movie. I love the practical sets they built along with the use of quality green screens. There were some beautiful locations ranging from some breathtaking space battles\\, a desolate island\\, a salt layered planet\\, and more. There were some moments that could be chalked up as some of the best shots in franchise history and that's not an exaggeration. There was some iffy moments where some of the shots were over \/ under exposed\\, and some moments of questionable CGI. But other than all of that\\, I think the movie looked pretty amazing. \\n\\nOne problem with this film is that there are some characters who were supposedly mean to play bigger roles\\, but they still get minimal to no extra depth given to them. Without spoilers\\, Captain Phasma is one of those characters. Her character probably makes an appearance for a total of 5 minutes. We still know nothing about her and we still don't care for her. Snoke is a huge one whose identity is still unknown. While I actually like the direction they went with his character\\, it kind of seemed like a waste. We also get some useless characters (which is a real waste of talent) from guys like Benicio Del Toro and others. It's kind of disappointing in the grand scheme of things\\, but understandable when you realize how much content they have to potentially fit into one film. \\n\\nThe other real negative thing was the story ark between Finn and Rose. It was honestly a waste of 30 minutes. Their chemistry was really iffy and besides that\\, the whole love interest thing was really misplaced. It was the cheesier part of the film and honestly\\, it's a big reason as to why this film suffered a bit. It's a big\\, unnecessary detour in the middle of the chaos. We don't get the development we want from Finn's character and the character of Rose is poorly written. They take a detour to an uninteresting planet to give us messages that are also misplaced. The messages their ark was trying to tell didn't belong in this movie and honestly\\, they could've just taken the entire subplot out. I wish they went a different direction with Finn's character\\, as I think it would've solved multiple problems. \\n\\nWith all of that being said\\, I still think this is a technical great film\\, while also being something I really enjoyed. I honestly feel like fans of the Star Wars franchise will never be happy. I think people are focused so much on the negatives of this film that they completely ignore the positives. I'm still astonished at the low score on Rotten Tomatoes but besides that\\, I implore you to watch this film with an open mind so that you can form your own opinion and view an all around great film.","true":true}
