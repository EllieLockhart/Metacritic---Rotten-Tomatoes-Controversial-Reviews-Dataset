Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and the characters are so important to me. This film is a slap in the face to all fans and honestly\\, non-fans alike. To the fans\\, it's a disrespectful take on some of its major characters. To the non-fans\\, it's simply a bad film. The new characters are underdeveloped and unlikable\\, the existing characters make choices that are lame and questionable\\, the editing is messy\\, the CGI is kind of lame\\, and there are serious\\, serious plot holes that an amateur storyteller would have noticed. The few aspects I enjoyed: their exploration into the powers of the force.... other than that I left feeling cold and sad. Even 'Empire' leaves the audience with a sense of hope. Not this film. I am an avid Star Wars fan and for the first time in my life\\, I am not looking forward to the next episode.","true":true}
