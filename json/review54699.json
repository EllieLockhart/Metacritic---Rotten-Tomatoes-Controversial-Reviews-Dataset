Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really hated it. And from what I've seen\\, there's been more credible reasons for disliking it than liking it. So many plot holes. So many characters I haven't even begun to care for. So many times something is built up to be something really cool and interesting to ultimately just be slammed down into the ground with no remorse or care for what it could have been\\, like Rey and Kylo's relationship\\, the entire character of Snoke and his origins\\, Rey's family\\, Kylo's reasoning for turning to Snoke and abandoning Luke\\, the Knights of Ren and Captain Phasma just to name a few.\\n\\nPeople keep saying they've 'gone on in a direction they didn't expect' and there are some really mind blowing twists and turns.. I don't see that here at all. Or maybe I do\\, but purely because they are so mindbogglingly stupid and unsatisfying.?\\n\\nThe decisions to have interchanging directors during the course of this trilogy really shows here\\, with Rian Johnson completely missing the point of the first film\\, which admittedly wasn't excellent\\, and the plot holes are just totally inexcusable in my opinion.","true":true}
