Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force is strong in my family... My father has it\\, I have it\\, my children have it...which is why I felt compelled to post this (my first ever review) to say how extremely disappointed I am with this film.  Many of the negative reviews are spot on\\, so no need to beat the dead horse or waste time laying out the details again here (I will say that I agree 100% that the Finn\/Rose\/Canto Bight\/DJ\/Phasma subplot was pointless and should have been omitted entirely). Suffice to say that if Rian Johnson is really a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, he would have shown a lot more respect for Luke and the force dogma that made the original trilogy great.  Instead\\, I think the scene early in the film where Luke takes his father's light saber and carelessly throws it off a cliff about sums up what Rian Johnson did with Star Wars.  I understand that Johnson\\, et. al.\\, wanted to do something new\\, groundbreaking and different with Star Wars\\, but I cannot believe he or Disney intended to make a movie that would turn lifelong fans and entire Star Wars families off of Star Wars.  Sometimes\\, you just have to give the people what they want\\, and that means Luke does not end up a disgruntled\\, disheveled\\, regretful old man\\, who returns just to make one last heroic stand\\, even though that might be \\\"interesting\\\" or unexpected (it's actually clich\u00e9\\, if you think about it).  I get it; at some point Luke has to die\\, but this one last hurrah seemed inadequate.  It also means maybe you take the time to explain why Snoke is so powerful\\, or to give Rey more significance in the universe and to the Skywalker legacy than just being some random girl that was sold by drunken paupers to Unkar Plot (especially considering how extraordinarily strong with the force she appears to be).  It's much more satisfying\\, even if obvious or expected\\, because it just feels more like Star Wars.   Also had a problem with Yoda's return\\, as Johnson takes the silly Yoda from ESB and makes him ridiculous.  Long and short is that my family\\, with multiple children who love Star Wars\\, own the movies\\, toys\\, clothes\\, bedsheets\\, toothbrushes\\, lamps\\, etc.\\, etc.)\\, and that may not continue into the future after Episode VIII because it was such a disappointment.   I think that says more about this movie than anything else.  JJ Abrams is our only hope to salvage the mess left by Rian Johnson.  I would say there are better odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field.","true":true}
