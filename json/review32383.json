Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is normally a franchise about good guys with destined lineages struggling against a monolithic evil. The Last Jedi seems primarily concerned with subverting this expectation. It showcases the failures of its destined archetypes\\, muddies a bit of the expected black and white morality\\, and asks us to question the value of legends. Where before the saga was about the triumph of goodness\\, The Last Jedi is about learning from failure.","true":true}
