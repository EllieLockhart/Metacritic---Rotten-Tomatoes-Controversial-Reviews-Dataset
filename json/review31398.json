{"101487":168478,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some minor spoilers\\, be warned. Not that it matters because this movie is an insult to the intelligence of any self-respecting Star Wars fan. The film is poorly written with gaping plot holes\\, lazily acted (with some notable exceptions) and very badly directed to the point of unfathomable ridiculousness and these blunders are just the tip of the iceberg. What's even more baffling is that there seems to be a contrived consensus praising the film\\, showering it with positive reviews!? Genuinely WTF!? Are these truly the reviews of competent\\, professional and unbiased critics? Did we even watch the same movie!? What part of this abomination deserves even an iota of commendation (besides the cinematography\\, which granted\\, is epic)!? Is it the unabated dismantling of the powerful story pillars built by the original trilogy? The outright shaming of Luke Skywalker!? What about the overturning of the very concept of the Force itself! What I mean by this is that they consistently dilute and devalue what it means to be a Jedi. The trials and tribulations in understanding and learning how to use the power of the force are presented as a given. You don't just wake up one day and realize: \\\"fuck me\\, I guess I'm an all-powerful force-wielder now! ...Kewl.\\\" Just because someone is super talented\\, doesn't mean they are instantly omnipotent. What a load of half-baked horse shit. It took Yoda\\, Luke even Anakin years and years of training\\, meditation and the arduous honing of their skills to achieve greatness. Consistent self-discipline and dedication. All concepts no one in this movie seems even remotely familiar with and even Luke's character seems to have forgotten. In any case\\, the fact that everyone in their mother can pretty much just wake up one day and either force Mary Poppins her way back from the dead (Leia)\\, or defeat the most powerful living Jedi and levitate mountains (Rey)\\, or even just casually summon a broomstick to their hands to mop the floor with (seriously: Random stable kid at the end of movie...W.T.F.??)- all goes to show what kind of total lack of respect the makers of this movie have for the concept of the Force and what it means to be a Jedi. But\\, I guess it's a generational disease. After all\\, we live in a society where every fucking moron reject is told they are super-dooper-awesome just for taking up space\\, where kids get medals for coming in last place and most of today's entitled brats believe they can have anything they want in life\\, just because they want it. Grow the fuck up. It's a downright travesty. The Last Jedi is more than just a bad film\\, it's the crucifixion of a modern classic. This film is nothing less than an open affront to the franchise and everything that Star Wars stands for. It\u00b4s almost as if Disney is on a mission to purposefully mutilate\\, mangle\\, or even utterly crush one of the shining beacons of modern mythology that profoundly shaped my childhood. I am deeply disappointed and saddened as I believe many fans are and they damn well should be. Help us George Lucas\\, you're our only hope!? This is what it's come to.","true":true}
