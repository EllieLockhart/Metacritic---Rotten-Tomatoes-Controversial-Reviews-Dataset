Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fresh and new.\\n(Possible SPOILERS to come)\\n\\nI left the theater with a new set of feelings that never got from other episodes. You expect it to be dark because it is the middle episode\\, but yet it is so full of hope. You expect it to be brutal to the good guys and it actually goes beyond what you expect. It introduces new aspects of the Force and develops characters on the level of Empire Strikes back and beyond!","true":true}
