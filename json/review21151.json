Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was utterly disappointed the this latest installment. I was visually stunning but that's about it. The story was shallow and seemed like it was there just to tie all the things the director wanted to place there together. The characters are not interesting and hard to care about. I didn't enjoy the political agenda and ideas they pushed throughout the movie. Humour seemed out of place almost every time and felt forced. All these things made me leave the theater silently and decided not to come back for any other Star Wars movie if this are going to continue to go this way. It's a franchise killer for me. The fact that I had to write this kind of review about my childhood's favorite franchise really breaks my hearth.","true":true}
