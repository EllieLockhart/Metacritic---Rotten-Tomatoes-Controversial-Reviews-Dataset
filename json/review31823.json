Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Special effects and music were good but not much else.  Obviously made for people who never saw the originals.  If you liked 1 thru 6\\, I would skip.  It's a bit awkward to watch.  I wish I hadn't.","true":true}
