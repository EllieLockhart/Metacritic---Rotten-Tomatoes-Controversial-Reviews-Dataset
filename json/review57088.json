Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This if by far one of the worst SW movies to come out. \\nThey try from the start to inject the series with humor that just feels like the sticky toy you throw at a wall and it just slowly dribbles down to the floor not ever really sticking to anything for good. \\nEvery setup that had been put in the boiler from last episode was just taken and thrown over the shoulder like a piece of garbage for quick slapstick humor or put down as a side-note\\, like it didn't actually mean anything now. \\n\\nyeah yeah but what about Jar-Jar he wasn't in it. Nope he wasn't\\, but there you had one character that was the source of all the slapstick humor they wanted to put in\\, and you could have scenes and character building with all the others and you knew from the scene to scene\\, if Jar-Jar was a part of it\\, this would be where they wanted something slapstick and you could brace yourself. This time around\\, you were looking at a scene\\, getting into it\\, hoping for this being the good character development\\, and then comes. \\\"Can't you at least put a shirt\\, towel or a robe on\\\" WTF is going on here people. \\n\\nAnd the big moments where you actually could have seen some conflict with Luke wanting to burn it all down\\, you get a little puppy that turns around on a platter not deciding\\, and a puppet just doing it for giggles. They are throwing out everything they could have made serious and thoughtful just for laughs. \\nSo much that when you get to a part that without a doubt is a spaceball throwback with the ironing of the uniform\\, you are about to vomit bad jokes that it just goes by and you try not to have this one be the one to put you over the top. \\n\\nAnd let us not talk about the purple haired lady\\, the commanding deck that just yeah whatever they didn't mean anything\\, and the Casino part of the movie.. \\n\\nIf I could give it 1 stars I would\\, but they had some very few things going for it\\, that I can't floor this movie to the ground. But let this be the Last movie this director ever makes\\, and fire the writing team and get someone on board that actually can make jokes a part of the scene and not something that just feels so outside of it all.","true":true}
