Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the movie\\, story well done and music as always was great. Hamill and Fischer were amazing - so why does it get only 3 stars - cause you robbed me and every other Star Wars fan of a real Luke Skywalker battle - not good enough there and us that grew up with these movies needed it - you missed the mark.....\ud83d\ude22","true":true}
