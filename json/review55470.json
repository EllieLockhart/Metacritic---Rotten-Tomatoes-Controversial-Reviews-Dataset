Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most everything I feel  about this movie has already been said here. So I'll just say this - forget about the fans' subverted expectations with Luke's storyline\\, forget about the unanswered questions\\, hell\\, forget about many of the complaints being lodged at this movie. And what are we left with? Aside from a few great scenes and bits of good dialogue here and there\\, we're left with a convoluted plot\\, poor writing\\, confused themes\\, out of place humor\\, and terrible subplots. TLJ would become watchable for me if it was cleaned up a bit and was 45 minutes shorter. Remove some poor humor\\, the whole casino plot\\, and a bunch of other silly shit and it becomes a B minus movie for me. Not great\\, but watchable.","true":true}
