Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually rich but it felt like a movie that just happened to have Star Wars characters versus a Star Wars movie. Characters that should been developed weren't really\\, certain plot points weren't very engaging and there is no way the overall timeline really fits. It was also heavy handed with the \\\"spark of the rebellion\\\". It was a bit meh.","true":true}
