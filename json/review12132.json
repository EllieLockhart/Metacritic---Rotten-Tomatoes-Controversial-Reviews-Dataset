Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan\\, have been since I first saw Star Wars in 1978.  Over that time\\, I have seen great films and I have seen terrible films and I have to say that The last Jedi\\, ranks towards the latter.  It isn't the worst Star Wars film (that would go to The Clone Wars (I am not including the Ewok films)) but I do have to say that I haven't been as disappointed in a film since I saw The Phantom Menace\\, the day before it was released nationally (I worked at my local cinema).\\n\\nThe film feels plodding an predictable.  It is silly and much of the humour either doesn't work or gets in the way.  The writing isn't great and the dialogue is cringe worthy at times.  \\n\\nIt got so bad\\, I spent half the film yawning and even contemplated falling a sleep.  It was just a huge let down.","true":true}
