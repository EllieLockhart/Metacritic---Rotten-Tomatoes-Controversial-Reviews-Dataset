Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing to learn that this trilogy was planned as three seperate movies with creative license given to separate writers\/directors. As a longtime fan\\, I hoped for the fulfillment of the nine-movie arc that Lucas plotted. I'm much less interested in Disney's plan to expand the Star Wars universe. I can live with porgs\\, and I'm totally happy with the diverse cast\\, but I don't like the way Johnson was allowed to subvert what was teased or that the only endgame is to move onto a fourth and fifth trilogy to milk a cash cow.","true":true}
