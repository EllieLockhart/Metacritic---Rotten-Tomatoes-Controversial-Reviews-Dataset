Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Find it interesting\\, a lot of the low vote comments actually have serious errors in watch actually happened in the movie.  I have watched it twice now and have learnt new things and sure more will become apparent after a few more viewings.\\n\\nThe whole point of this trilogy is to move on from the originals\\, and many people seem to want everything to stay the same and not embracing the new possibilities being created.","true":true}
