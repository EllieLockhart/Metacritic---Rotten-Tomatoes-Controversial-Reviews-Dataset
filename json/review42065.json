Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie meant the world to me. I was not disappointed in the slightest. The character development was substantial. I can not even begin to put my love and admiration for this movie into a single paragraph.","true":true}
