Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A wasted opportunity to build upon The Force Awakens\\, several key characters die pointless deaths that don't further the plot. Numerous attempts at humour whilst each on their own are probably ok\\, by the halfway point of the movie you are sick of the protagonists making wise cracks at inappropriate moments. Continues to play on the \\\"who are rey's parents?\\\" suspense\\, which if you watch the two movies back to back\\, just seems like \\\"why are they making such a big deal about this\\\" \\nMark Hamil said it best when he said he \\\"fundamentally disagrees with virtually everything written for his character\\\" the film makes bold choices for key characters\\, but doesn't deliver them in a way that is believable.","true":true}
