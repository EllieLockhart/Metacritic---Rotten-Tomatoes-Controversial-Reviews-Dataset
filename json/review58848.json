Part II on the other hand just feels like a game that\u2019s lost. On a technical level the work on display is phenomenal. The graphics are unreal\\, the animation work and AI is often next level\\, but the most important area\\, the characters and story is where things fall so short. Where as in the first game every character genuinely felt like they had purpose and an individual arc which added to overall arc between Ellie & Joel\\, the characters in Part II didn\u2019t connect & were often forgetful. The events that take place and actions taken by the characters also felt painfully contrived and awkward with none of the payoff the first game gave. By the later parts of the game I just wanted it to be over as it kept dragging on to its unsatisfying end. I\u2019ve heard others say that it\u2019s subverting your expectations and wants to express nihilism\\, but it all just comes off as incompetent writing. Overall after loving the first game to death Part II just falls so flat.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
