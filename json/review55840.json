{"101487":163331,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably not the best since Empire Strikes back like a lot of critics are saying\\, but definitely not the like the extremely biased reviews by some of audience who gave it half a star or one star.  Come on people seriously\\, a half a star.  I can think of a very long list of movies that are much worse than this.  I think the majority of people who are that hateful towards the movie are mainly disappointed because the movie didn't go the way they wanted it to\\, especially the story.  I agree that this story was questionable in some areas\\, but a half a star?  Hahahaha.  \\n\\nThis was still a Star Wars movie with top of the line special effects\\, cinematography (probably one of the best Star Wars for cinematography)\\, music (John Williams is probable the best composer of my lifetime and this movie has some of his best work)\\, acting (Mark Hammil did very well and others did good too)\\, sound effects\\, and comedy (yes\\, for the most part I liked the comedy and there was a lot of it).  The questions with this movie are the story\\, some decisions about some characters\\, and some new ways the force was used.  Still those a side this is was a great movie.  I did like The Force Awakens more.  Everyone I talked to loved The Last Jedi or at least liked it.  None of them would ever give it a low rating\\, even only 2 stars\\, let alone 1\/2.","true":true}
