Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a life-long Star Wars fan.  I saw A New Hope with my dad when I was 5 years old.  I hold Star Wars parties every May the 4th.  Yes\\, I'm a geek.  I bought tickets for the first show opening day.  Maybe my hopes were too high\\, but I left thoroughly disappointed.  What has Rian Johnson done to my beloved characters?!?  Luke was unrecognizable in personality.  Leia--flying thru space like Superman?  I could go on and on.  This movie kicked off my seasonal depression.  Thanks!","true":true}
