Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sad disappointment to the Star Wars trilogy. Reminded me of Attack of the Clones\\, and the other prequels. With all of the CGI effects\\, this movie lacks both the relavent story line of Star Wars The Force Awakens\\, as well as live action scenes TFA offers. The Last Jedi also tries to play out as a \\\"comedy\\\" movie... the Star Wars trilogy has no room for lame jokes\\, poorly timed jokes\\, and irrelevant story line scenes.","true":true}
