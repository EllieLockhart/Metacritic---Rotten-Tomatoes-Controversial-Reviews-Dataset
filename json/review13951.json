Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't know or care about Star Wars and you just want to see some bright pretty lights and hear a few bangs\\, you'll enjoy it. The special effects are done quite well; it looks very nice. If however\\, you know and\/or have any positive feelings about Star Wars\\, its history\\, mythology\\, etc (or if you simply care about good characters and story telling) you will likely consider this the worst movie in Star Wars history. The story telling is awful. It's preachy. It does many contradictory things. It waste almost if not all of the story lines set up in The Force Awakens (which directly lowers the quality of that movie as this one makes all of that meaningless). It had long\\, unnecessary story lines in the movie that take up a lot of time and end up going nowhere. There is no overall progress to the plot; it is essentially in the exact same place in the beginning of the movie as it is at the end. They have some of the most ridiculous scenes in modern cinema (memetastic). Most of the jokes fall flat (not just for me\\, nobody laughed). Worst of all\\, the director treats this as if it were the first movie in its own series. They take the lore and beloved characters that have been concretely established over the past 40 years and throw all of it out just for the sake of it. Simply breaking expectations for its own sake is not a good thing. A movie about an uneducated stoner named Bruce Banner who\\, when angry\\, smokes some \\\"green\\\" and acts like a totally different person who seems\\, to himself\\, to be super intelligent is a concept that might work as its own but\\, expectations or not\\, would make for a horrible The Incredible Hulk\\, episode 8. Perhaps this director just forgot that this was episode 8 in one of the most well established fictional worlds in human history with the 9 main movies\\, countless books\\, animated series\\, etc. There is also the chance that the director knew nothing about Star Wars other than a few pop culture references. If you love Star Wars do not watch this movie. I have sworn off all new Star Wars movies because of this abomination. I may watch one or two stand alone ones similar to Rogue One (which I do like) but I will not watch any more of the trilogy movies; not episode IX and definitly not the new trilogy that they stupidly gave to the idiot who directed this disgusting film.","true":true}
