Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Damn! This was entertaining fun and still felt Star Wars-y. Many of the themes of good and evil\\, oppresion and freedom but freshly presented and full of subversion. All acted and shot prefectly. Thank you Rian Johnson\\, thank you Disney.","true":true}
