Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash. Will never watch this generic Hollywood action scifi cash grab again. Word of advice\\, dont waste your hard earned money. Also\\, someone really needs to call out these RottenTomato \\\"critics\\\". These critics need to be held accountable for their biased opinions. Overall\\, this is a below average movie that real star wars fan will never watch again along with Rogue One.","true":true}
