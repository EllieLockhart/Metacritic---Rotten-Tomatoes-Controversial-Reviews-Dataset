Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is honestly horrible and a complete disgrace to everything that is Star Wars. None of the returning characters act like themselves. Disney has honestly ruined Star Wars. The main character Rey has absolutely no character development and is the epitome of a Mary Sue character being always perfect and never does anything wrong and when they do something wrong there's nothing wrong and are gratified for it. The other main character introduced in 7\\, Finn\\, had absolutely no bearing on the entire movie. All his scenes could be removed and nothing in the movie would change. The acting is horrible. Everything about this movie just set up to make toys and money.  Supreme leader Snoke was completely wasted. The Leia scene was a disgrace. She was straight up dead and suddenly knows how to use the force and isn't affected by pressure\\, lack of air\\, and cold temperatures don't affect her. Even the prequels were better than this. Not only the worst Star Wars movie\\, but the worst movie I have seen.","true":true}
