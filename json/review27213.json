Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One reviewer wrote that The Last Jedi is a waste of 2.5 hrs.  I disagree!  It's a waste of 40 years!  Where on earth was this movie going?  The plot is pointless\\, the characters created in Force Awakens have grown stale\\, or were killed off without any explaination.  I just didn't get the point.  As far as the SJW nonsense goes\\, add all the progressivism you want\\, just please have a point when doing so.  \\n\\nThis movie was garbage and I don't see a way that episode IX can undo the damage done to the epic story.","true":true}
