{"101487":170171,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The last Jedi............Is a mitigated mess!!\\n\\nBut its a beautiful looking Mitigated mess. \\n\\nWhen coming into this movie you can say this film is fully decisive and its for good reason. Say what you want about The Force Awakens as much as the movie is playing it safe and using elements from\\, \\\"A New Hope\\\"\\, The Last Jedi is taking elements from\\, \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" but making it super complicated; You see with TFA\\, JJ Abrams initiated a set up and a set idea for what the future trilogies would establish like: Is Finn a possible Jedi? is that the reason why he easily broke free from his mind wipe? is there a possible Force bond between Rey and Finn cause they seem to have a strong pull towards one another. Are we going to find about about Finn's family? cause he was taken at birth but we should have some Idea if he had a brother or sister some place who are still alive? What makes Poe such a damn good pilot? in the comics its in his family but he's a uniquely strong pilot.....\\n\\nDoes Rian know how space works? cause sometimes I think he doesn't\\n\\n...You know questions like that. \\n\\nAll of this seem to come to an end when the fire na....I mean Rian Johnson \/ Kathleen Kennedy comes in. Look I won't pretend to deny that cinematography wise this is a beautiful looking movie; but with questionable dialog\\, even questionable plot elements\\, Characters who really shouldn't be in the film\\, other characters who only get lesser screen time than the last\\, every question from TFA completely wiped away leaving the viewer feeling like this is a finality rather than a continuation\\, A Mary sue\\, And a Luke Skywalker while I would understand the approach was done in a messy way  makes this film a walking SJW nightmare cause i feel that's what this movie was written for. \\n\\nWatching this movie more than once is a strain and I said to myself and in a review I would buy the blu ray or 4k when it was released and guess what? that didn't happen....at all!! \\nRey is every bit a Mary sue than I thought....she knows Wookie that she shouldn't know being that Jaku doesn't have wookies on there and yet you are telling a Jedi knight who knows Chewie for nearly 30 damn years what he's saying!? \\non top of that Best him in a combat!? B**ch are you for real!!? \\n\\n Finn\\, *sigh* is a f**king comic relief I get his intention is to protect Rey just in case she comes back from her mission and gets bombarded but the way Rian made this guy and considering he himself is a mystery cause we don't know how he defected so easily or his backstory\\, nope\\, none of that matters anymore so now what we have is a character who doesn't really matter anymore.....don't get me started on Canto Bight and the Finn\/Rose Kiss Geez hamfist much!!?\\n\\nPoe\\, comes off semi-useless\\, but I will be honest he seems to be us the viewers trying to figure out WTF is going on; later in the movie he runs into a PURPLE HAIRED commander.....I sh*t you not with this!  and there's suppose to be a plan....but because of this chick's actions nearly half the resistance DIES because the purple haired witch doesn't want to communicate with a MAN apparently! \\n\\nSoooo Phasma\\, is still a thing. \\\"Capt. Phasma will be VERY important to TLJ\\\" says Kathleen Kennedy with a smug grin on her face. If VERY important means being on screen for 7 mins in the last 20 mins of this movie then...Yeah she was very important....UNTIL SHE DIES!! \\n\\n....I think you get the common denominator in this; the majority of the men in this are either cowards\/Idiots  -or- out of line\/disobedient\/Traitors take your pick its as if Kathleen written it herself.  And I'm guessing Rian did this.....crapping to try to subvert our expectations and if you call completely trashing a connective tissue subversive after the last movie then yeah he did....BADLY!!\\n\\nIf things doesn't get worse\\, it will throughout this movie. We are introduced to  Rose Tico the most useless\\, cartoon character of a person. While I have nothing but love for the actress Kelly Marie-Tran (With her sexy self!!)I felt they placed her in this just to cater to the Asian audience (But if you read what china thought about TLJ ...it wasn't good so it backfired!). Her and Finn go to this casino which in a Star wars movie or novel its not rare its pretty common but to spend half of your movie in there knowing overall if the purple haired demon (Holdo is her name) had mentioned the plan all along...THAT mission would have never happened! \\n\\nThis along with Snoke\\, Kylo ren and Luke's \\\"Relationship\\\" you know Killing the nephew but save the serial killing father in Vader; makes this movie a convoluted meta tone of a movie that should have been re-shot or Rewritten...cause even Rian Johnson said himself he was never a good writer....and oh boy it shows. \\n\\nI can't advise a person to watch this movie only if you set your expectations low then you will find out its an okay movie nothing more. But overall\\, I lost all hopes for Episode 9 I don't know where this will go and that in of itself bothers me and honestly I don't care anymore where it goes.","true":true}
