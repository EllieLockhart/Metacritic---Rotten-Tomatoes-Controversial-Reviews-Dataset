Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want a well done space movie\\, Last Jedi is a great way to spent a couple hours as a follow-up to Force Awakens.\\n\\nIf you want a Star Wars movie\\, you could go in to it thinking it was The Asylum's knkckoff \\\"Final Spacewizards\\\" featuring Luka Skyrunner\\, Princess Leia Duo\\, Furbacca\\, and an assortment of almost limable\\, mostly disappointing characters. \\n\\nIt tries really hard to be a real Star Wars movie\\, but it lacks the magic\\, and sits\\, like pinnochio\\, as a wooden imitation. \\n\\nDisney can't get out of its own way with the stories they're choosing to tell.","true":true}
