Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic! I\u2019m a HUGE Star Wars saga fan and I think this was a perfect addition to the saga...original\\, but still a Star Wars movie...the plot was INCREDIBLE and the writing was super witty. I enjoyed that it wasn\u2019t just like the first or second trilogy\\, and this new trilogy seems to be adding and developing the Star Wars universe in a way that was totally unpredicted. Definitely recommend seeing this. ","true":true}
