Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn\u2019t answer any questions from the previous movies\\, weak characters with predictable story lines made this another over hyped Star Wars\\, the last Jedi had a decent start with lots of hope but in the end fell very very short of what it should\u2019ve been. This coming from lifelong fan\\, from the book to the videos games and movies. They could\u2019ve done so much more with certain character but chose not to address many fan theories or questions regarding them.","true":true}
