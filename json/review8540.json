Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, I'm 41 and grew up a diehard fan. This is my first RT review\\, and it is in defense of this movie\\, which I regard as the best since Empire. \\n\\nI had all sorts of theories about what might happen\\, who Snoke is\\, etc. The fact that Rian Johnson made a movie that no one could predict\\, that has a giant surprise every 20 minutes\\, is amazing. As a fan\\, I think I only wanted there to be a surprise ending twist worthy of The Empire Strikes Back. Instead\\, I got a movie that defied all expectations from the start. \\n\\nAre there problems in the story? Sure. Is it disconcerting to know that Abrams really didn't have any larger story in mind\\, or backstory for any characters\\, when he did The Force Awakens? Yep. Is it obvious that Johnson deliberately made Kylo Ren more powerful\\, and Rey less powerful\\, in order to address audience's incredulity after watching VII? Sure. Personally\\, I don't need to know who the Knights of Ren and Snoke are when it doesn't look like  JJ Abrams bothered to write anything for those characters he made up. \\n\\nCanto Bight diversion\\, millenial comedy\\, and endless low-speed space chase aside\\, Johnson's The Last Jedi gives us a story we can never see coming\\, which\\, I argue\\, is very much a Star Wars movie and feels that way\\, despite the iconoclastic moves. I found it to be thrilling and very much in line with what a Star Wars movie should be. Reach out with your feelings.","true":true}
