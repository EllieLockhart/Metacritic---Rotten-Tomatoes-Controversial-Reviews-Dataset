Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been looking forward to this film for years. Huge star wars fan. Film isn't perfect but it scratches that Star Wars itch\\, adds a good amount to the universe\\, a good place to carry on from and some brilliant action sequences. I do not understand the audience score at all.","true":true}
