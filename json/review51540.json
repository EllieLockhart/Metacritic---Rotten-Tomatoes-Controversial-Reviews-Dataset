Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A confused movie.\\n\\nCheesy humor and dark tone do not compliment each other completely removing tension from the opening scene and others.\\n\\nConsistency of character from the older movies is almost non-existent from Leia displaying never before seen Force abilities to Luke's hopelessness.\\n\\nCasting was done by a marketing department with obvious forced plot points whose sole purpose was getting the asian market (and failed horribly)\\n\\nOvert and uninspired political undertones of patriarchy and modern feminism\\n\\nA director who is more interested in subverting your expectations than telling a compelling story\\n\\nThis is a beautiful movie visually is all I can say that is positive\\n\\nThis movie may have killed the franchise","true":true}
