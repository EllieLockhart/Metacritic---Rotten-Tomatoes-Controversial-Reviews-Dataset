{"101487":174516,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'The Force Awakens' felt like an interesting platform to continue the central Star Wars story. Although many say it's a copy of a 'New Hope'\\, I think it was a good strategy from J.J. Abrams\\, to recapture the old nostalgic fans and to present the new ones everything the old glorify from the saga. 'The Last Jedi'\\, disassembled all the basic points of its predecessor\\, everything the Force Awakens was constructing in its storyline was deconstructed\\, like hitting the reset button with the only intention of 'surprising the audience'. I love to be surprised but only when the twists have a real purpose for the whole story. 'Rogue One' keeps being my hope that Disney can make a really good Star Wars film\\, they got me to care about characters I've never known existed. It was a story that kept constructing\\, were every move felt important for the characters and the story; it felt real. #ImWithMarkHamill","true":true}
