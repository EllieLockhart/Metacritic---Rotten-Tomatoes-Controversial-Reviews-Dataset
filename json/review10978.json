Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having had a day to reflect on The Last Jedi. I can sadly say I am even more disappointed with it than I was when I walked out fo the cinema. The ridiculous social-political statements\\, the determination to pander to modern PC requirements like turning Luke into a miserable git has left me feeling deeply unhappy. \\n\\nin order \\n1 - Empire\\n2 - Star wars\/ New hope\\n3 - Force Awakens \\n4 - Return of the Jedi\\n5 - Attack of the clones\\n6 - revenge of the Sith\\n7 - Phantom Menace\\n8 - Starwars Christmas Special\\n9 - Last Jedi\\n\\nSack Kennedy\\, and Johnson and delete this abomination. Remember this pile of poo has been in the can for most of this year. they knew it was crap hence the super heavy marketing and all the critics getting shmoozed for a great review. Se got sold a turd. am disgusted with Lukes story and how they have destroyed this franchise. I am sure millennials will love it\\, but any fan over 35 has been betrayed.","true":true}
