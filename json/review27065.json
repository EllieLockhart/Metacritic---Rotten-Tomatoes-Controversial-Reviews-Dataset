Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most aggressively stupid movies I've seen I  a while. I made an account here just to review it- please save your money and watch this on Netflix.\\n\\nPlot problems caused only by characters not acting reasonably. No twists you couldn't see from a mile off. Neither Rey nor Kylo did anything that we wouldn't expect. Endless quips spoiling otherwise meaningful moments.\\n\\nThe deus ex machina at the end turns most of Ep IV and VI into one big plot hole. Scale is equally disregarded: the galactic Resistance comprises 3 ships and 400 people\\, who spend the entirety of the movie trapped in a low speed car chase.\\n\\nWithout exaggeration\\, the worst movie I've seen all year.","true":true}
