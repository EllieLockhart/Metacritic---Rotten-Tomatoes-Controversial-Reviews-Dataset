Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first saw it I hated it. Even though I hated it\\, I could tell that it was without a doubt the most well shot Star Wars movie (Rian and his team have great eyes for cinematic framing\\, man oh man). Then I watched it a second time\\, many many many months later\\, after getting over my visceral emotional reaction\\, and paid closer attention to the dialogue\\, setups\\, etc\\, and it became one of my favorite Star Wars films. So much depth\\, so much to unpack. At first I was afraid that The Last Jedi has ruined Star Wars and so the next film wouldn\u2019t be able to be any good. I was half right: The Last Jedi has so much depth and is so well layered (even if you hate those layers) that the next film probably will end up seeming flatter even if it gives fans everything they want and they are ultimately satisfied by it.","true":true}
