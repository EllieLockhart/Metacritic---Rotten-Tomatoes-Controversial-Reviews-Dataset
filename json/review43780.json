Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. It had no sensitivity to the entire saga\\, the tone and feel of the Star Wars universe and literally had no redeeming factors. Every single element was incorrect when there was a clear and interesting path to follow on from JJ Abrams' TFA. Rian Johnson subverted everything that is SW for no reason other than to be subversive which lead to a half-baked\\, insulting and scattered film. I am a die hard fan who loves both the original trilogy and prequels\\, the legends\\, the clone wars and the old republic era material and this film single-handedly assassinated the Star Wars universe. None of the key questions raised in TFA which is what had fans hooked were not addressed in a giant F**K U to the fans and followers. Disappointed\\, devastated\\, disgusted and unsatisfied.","true":true}
