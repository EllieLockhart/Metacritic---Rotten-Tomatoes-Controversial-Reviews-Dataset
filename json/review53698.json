Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of pointless\\, boring story arcs and inconsistencies with the five previous films (as well as itself)\\, this movie deserves a one star only for the special effects. \\n\\nWhile some of the characters had some small amount of promise coming out of TFA\\, this promise was not only not delivered on in a way that shows personal growth for them\\, but was reversed into a nonsensical  mess by the end. \\n\\nEntire chunks of the movie could be removed without losing anything of value\\, while some of the few actually interesting scenes and ideas were scrapped and can only be found in the cut scenes on the DVD.\\n\\nMuch like TFA\\, the film doesn't really grasp what makes Star Wars the legendary series it has been\\, managing to outdo the divisiveness of the prequels tenfold. Unlike TFA\\, however\\, this story adds absolutely nothing to canon while simultaneously creating plot holes big enough to slip Starkiller base through.\\n\\nIt's not even really amusing as a popcorn flick\\, which at least TFA managed to do. Hamfisted social messages and \\\"Gotcha!\\\" moments masquerading as creativr and meaningful subversion of expectation are not enough to carry a film along\\, especially not one in such a treasured franchise.\\n\\nIf you know anything about the Star Wars universe\\, give it a pass. Your sanity will thank you.","true":true}
