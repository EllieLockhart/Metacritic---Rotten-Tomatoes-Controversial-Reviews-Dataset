Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand what all the hate is about.\\nYes\\, the first act is a little messy in places\\, but it really improves.\\nSure\\, the wild fan theories of the internet didn't turn out to be true\\, but who's fault is that? It's a lose-lose situation. \\nCorrect fan-theories = predictability. Wrong fan-theories = Dissapointement\\nThe fact that the audience score for this movie is nearly the same as TFM is not right. Hopefully\\, once people get over the fact that Snoke isn't the pear from Attack of The Clones\\, people will accept that this is\\, in my opinion\\, a good (not perfect\\, but good) movie\\, the score will become a little more appropriate.","true":true}
