Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All you haters out there that just want a predictable unoriginal Star Wars movie\\, just stay at home watch Force Awakens over and over. The Last Jedi is creative and full of surprises. And there's porgs!","true":true}
