Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst one yet. Luke deserved better. The new trilogy lost me when both Rey and Finn picked up a light saber and did battle with Kylo Ren with no training.  Finn isn't even strong with the force and he keeps trying to run away\\, some hero.  Kylo The new too bad guy.  Hated 8\\, a travesty\\, Rian and Disney did an awful job.","true":true}
