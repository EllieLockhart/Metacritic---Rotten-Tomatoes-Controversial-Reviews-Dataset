Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would say about half of this films runtime does nothing to advance the plot\\, and is made irrelevant shortly after happening. Finn and Roses trip to the gambling planet was a particularly weird detraction from the main plot. The other main I have is that the villains don't evoke any real fear or strong emotions from me. They are weak and incompetent unlike Darth Vader\\, Boba Fett or Sidious. I think the characters and are interesting in and of themselves but unfortunately the situations they are placed into are mostly bland and uninteresting.","true":true}
