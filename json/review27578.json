Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, this movie was amazing. While there were a few things I was not particularly fond of\\, I found that the plot tied in really well with not only The Force Awakens but each and every movie before it. The direction they are taking this franchise\\, specifically with The Last Jedi is fresh and exciting. It had a lot of the Star Wars elements that one looks for in a movie\\, coupled with humor and dramatic twists. While there are some people who didn't like the answers to questions we had from The Force Awakens\\, it makes sense in the grand scheme of things (ie: Rey's parentage). Anyone who can comprehend and enjoy a complex form of story-telling will thoroughly enjoy the magnificent movie that Rian Johnson created for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
