Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really poor story arc and directing.   Poor Luke is a shell of himself.  Bombers in space?   Slow motion space chase?   1\/3 of the movie is a pointless tangent?   Suicide is ok if you are a strong female character\\, but when Finn tries to do the same he is saved by Rose?   And sudden she loves him after less than a day with him?   Oh and they teleport back to the rebels somehow faster than the first order?   This movie is completely bad on all fronts.  Don't even get me started on the Leia force grab in space.   Did anyone even edit this movie or say \\\"no\\\" to an idea during the story boarding?   Wow.  Worst Star Wars movie hands down and that includes the Jar Jar debacle.","true":true}
