Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Snoke was the worst villian ever\\, stupid even\\, we are used to empire baddies to be smart and mean\\, not condescending and dumb. Big ships are supposed to have shields\\, and jedis are no supposed to fly like the virgin mary or superman in space\\, totally stupid.","true":true}
