Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was the best star wars movie ever! A lot of Reylo\\, a lot of pleasant sensations\\, romance\\, nostalgia. I was flying for days after the movie. I was in love. True love. Rian Johnson and all the actors gave us a fairy tale in the spirit of old episodes\\, really compassionate\\, full of empathy\\, cozy emotions. Story was really alive.","true":true}
