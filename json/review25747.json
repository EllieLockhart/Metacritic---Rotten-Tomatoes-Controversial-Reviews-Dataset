Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a Star Wars movie\\, but instead a movie that uses Star Wars characters to sell garbage to crotchfruit. Not plot driven and not character driven; this film leaves you wondering if you are even a fan anymore of the series that you grew up loving.","true":true}
