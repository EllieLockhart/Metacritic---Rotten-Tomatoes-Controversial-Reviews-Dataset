Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't imagine that half the population (the male half) doesn't appreciate having man hating feminist propaganda \\nrubbed in the face for 2 & 1\/2 hours at $20 a ticket. When they thought they were going to maybe recapture a little \\nmagic by escaping off to a science fiction space Cowboy Samurai Fantasy Movie. I certainly didn't think I was going to \\npay for my family to sit through 2 & 1\/2 hours of Femin-nazi Daddy Hate Porn Besides character assassination and the \\nmeticulous murder of all possible alpha male personality types\\, hallow characters that nobody cares about\\, major plot holes\\, \\na slow motion chase\\, bad writing\\, zero logic\\, a convoluted story\\, and editing done by Cuisinart. It's Kathleen Kennedy's Man \\nHating Feminist Nazi wet dream. And the Leia Superman scene was beyond stupid. with zero character archs\\, and the tasteless \\nrepresentation of a classic hero as a coward\\,  and then his death. All while teaching my daughter that just being female makes \\nher superior that she'll never have to work\\, endure\\, struggle\\, earn\\, practice\\, study\\, train\\, cultivate or develop a single thing\\, \\nbecause she's just superior to people whom have worked for years to become masters\\, but she's just better just because she is female. \\nAnd I don't see why they can't can not have a strong male and a strong female protagonist (like 4\\, 5\\, and 6 had) Seriously what am I \\nsupposed to tell my son? Oh sorry you were born at the wrong time you're not allowed to have a good guy strong moral male role models \\nanymore\\, that time had past. Only females get to be the smart and strong protagonist good guys?  And Rey is such a blatant Mary Sue \\nshe even defeated Luke during her 2 out of 3 Lessons that LUKE Taught her. I'm done Stars Wars. Again I certainly would not have \\npaid 50 dollars in ticket prices alone too see a movie If I had known my family would have to sit through a 2 &1\/2 hour Man Hating\\, \\nFemin-nazi Marxist Lecturing Man Hate Rally.","true":true}
