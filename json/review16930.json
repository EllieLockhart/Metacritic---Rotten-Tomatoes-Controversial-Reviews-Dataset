Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only signed up with RT to add my two cents on this film.  After watching the film on opening night\\, my interest and excitement for the new trilogy got absolutely destroyed like that Gamorrean guard in Jabba's pit in ROTJ. Jar Jar Binks must be Rian Johnson's biggest fan now because someone else is in the running for the biggest disappointment in the Star Wars franchise.  If Disney gives the new trilogy to this poor excuse of director\\, I'll be boycotting the new trilogy especially after what he did to Luke Skywalker's character: Unforgivable.","true":true}
