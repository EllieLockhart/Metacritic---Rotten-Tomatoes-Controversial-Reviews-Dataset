Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. Storyline horrible. Character development non existent. Complete waste of original characters. Questions left unanswered and the ones that were answered lacked any reasoning or interest. Left movie with no sense of anticipation for the next film. Felt more like the end of a trilogy then second movie of series.","true":true}
