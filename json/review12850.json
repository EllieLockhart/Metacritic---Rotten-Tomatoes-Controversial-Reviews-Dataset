Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't Hate this as much as some fans. I place this one ahead of Episode I\\, Episode II and the Theatrical Clone Wars Movie\\, That's all. It has too many plot holes\\, and is pretty terribly written in parts and for some specific characters. Other Parts are amazing and breathtaking\\, and have excellent writing.\\,.  I Very Much enjoyed about 1\/2 of this film. problem is\\, the other 1\/2 is absolute garbage.","true":true}
