Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie that ruins the lore and mythology of Star Wars.   The original trilogy is my favorite series of movies ever and this film did nothing but tarnish the legacy of those movies.  The portrayal of Luke Skywalker in this film is actually worse than the worst scenario that I had imagined.   There was no way they could screw this up in my mind\\, I said to myself\\, before watching the movie.   They did not just screw this movie up\\, they ruined Star Wars forever for me.   I will not be seeing any of the future films released by Lucasfilm\/Disney.    They have lost a long time fan.","true":true}
