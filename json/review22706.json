Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like the episode before\\, this one falls short of what the commercials continue to push. All the good parts were shown in the commercials. I miss the good ole days when Steven Spielberg ran the show. Went to the theatre to see this Christmas Day with the family and what a waste of time.","true":true}
