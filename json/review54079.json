Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow\\, such amazing visuals\\, such terrible writing. Rian Johnson can film it but he cant create a good story. All the great set ups from Force awakens were wasted\\, and all the characters were so week\\, Fin and Rose could of been good but a real missed opportunity. And why destroy the past? only bad people burn books and hide the past\\, so makes sense with Kylo but not Yoda\\, the past had some good lessons to learn from! \\nHow anyone can give this film a 5star is very strange.","true":true}
