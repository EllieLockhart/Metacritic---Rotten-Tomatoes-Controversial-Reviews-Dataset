Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unbelievably bad writing and direction. No meaningful story arc. Every plot point is nonsense. Every scene in in some way defies reasoning. No character development. No relatablity. No continuity.  Ignores everything we already understand about this universe. Some decent acting and special effects\\, as expected with a movie with this budget. The rest is a steaming pile of hot postmodern garbage.","true":true}
