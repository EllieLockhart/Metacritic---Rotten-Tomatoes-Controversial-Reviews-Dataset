Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty pathetic for a studio with so much resources at its disposal but I guess you can't buy talent in any given position.. especially when making a good story isn't the primary objective. From mom jokes to universe breaking physics\\, this movie was a mess that fits into the Star Wars Saga like a 2x4 in a 1000 piece Monet jigsaw puzzle. ","true":true}
