Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. The smartest Star Wars in a long time\\, the characters are all challenged personally\\, deeply. I liked how Luke faces the most dire threats to an idealist: burnout and failure. That's original\\, especially in big budget films with this much at stake. I appreciated it.","true":true}
