Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt less manicured and controlled than other recent Star Wars films. Minus some of the cutesy animal stuff\\, I loved this movie. It surprised me\\, and left me looking forward to the ending. This is not a retread of Empire Strikes back\\, and i liked seeing the characters dealing with consequences- those of their actions and the actions of others. To me\\, this field had character- a certain \u201csalt\u201diness ;)","true":true}
