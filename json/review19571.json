Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took 2 viewings to come to really like TFA\\, I had my issues but I did like the movie although it didn't take me where I thought it was\\, the same can be said for TLJ\\, but where it took me is much more exciting and intellectual than I even thought it could be.","true":true}
