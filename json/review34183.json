{"101487":172647,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you for the Friends analogy\\, Mike S. Very astute. It made me think of another analogy and inspired me to create an account and give my very first review on Rotten Tomatoes. \\n\\nI agree with what many others have said about the countless\\, super annoying plot holes and inconsistencies. I also agree that the movie is a visual masterpiece. Absolutely stunning. What I'd like to expand on are some of the reasons this movie is an astounding failure in storytelling.\\n\\nI'm a 40-year-old woman. I fell in love with Star Wars as a kid\\, not so much because of the space battles\\, light saber fights\\, and force mythology\\, but because of the story. For me it was about the relationships between the characters. Han and Leia's love story\\, Luke's emotional and tragic relationship with his father\\, Luke's friendships with R2D2 and Yoda\\, Luke and Leia's discovery of their family bond\\, Han and Lando's friendship\\, betrayal\\, and reconciliation\\, the bond between R2D2 ad C3PO\\, even the twisted and codependent relationship between the Emperor and Darth Vader. The characters were made real through their relationships with each other\\, and they became like old friends\\, who I have loved and held dear for many many years. I think the film critics who praise The Last Jedi don't understand the strong emotional connection that so many of us have with the old characters. They also don't seem to understand the need to build that kind of connection with new characters. \\n\\nTo help explain\\, let's pretend that some much anticipated sequels to Lord of the Rings were made\\, picking up the story 40 years later. After the second movie this is what we have:\\n\\nAragorn didn't like being tied down with the responsibilities of being King of Gondor so he left Arwen and the little boy they had to go be a Ranger of the North again. \\n\\nThat little boy\\, growing up without a dad and a brokenhearted mom\\, starts thinking about moving into Mordor to restart the Orc breeding program. \\n \\nSam gets wind of this and moseys on down to Gondor to kill him in his sleep. Sure his devotion to Frodo never wavered even as Frodo was slowing consumed by the evil of the One Ring\\, but that was then\\, this is now. Sam is older and grumpy (I guess?) and can't be bothered to help redeem anyone. \\n\\nHe decides at the last minute not to kill Aragorn's son\\, and instead of hanging around to try to help him he runs off to the Paths of the Dead under the mountain to wallow in pity and drink cave troll milk\/semen.\\n\\nArwen and Aragorn's son continues to become bad (because some random guy with no backstory came along and said\\, \\\"Hey\\, you wanna be evil?\\\" and he said\\, \\\"OK\\, sure!\\\") He sets up shop in Mordor\\, rebuilding Barad Dur and sending orcs to pillage and destroy the countryside. He destroys Gondor and Rohan and eventually makes his way to the Shire. \\n\\nAragorn comes to the Shire to confront his son but he's killed by him in a few minutes.\\n\\nArwen has now lost her son and the love of her life and is crushed and broken. \\n\\nSome new characters that we started to care about after the first movie but are now flat and boring finally locate Sam in the Paths of the Dead to try to convince him to come help them defeat the bad guy (who\\, remember\\, was once that sweet little boy running through the woods in Arwen's vision) becasue he's about to kill Sam's whole family up in Hobbiton. Sam says\\, \\\"Naw\\, I think I'll just stay here and roll around in the piles of skulls.\\\" \\n\\nThe new characters give up and head to Hobbiton to try to save it. When they arrive\\, only three hobbit holes remain with a handful of hobbits hiding inside them. The rest of the Shire is completely destroyed and most of the hobbits are dead. Thankfully Rosie and the kids are still alive. \\n\\nMeanwhile\\, as the Hobbits are fighting for their lives one of the annoying Sackville-Bagginses turns up to lecture everyone about how income inequality and animal cruelty run rampant in the Shire. They also reveal that Merry and Pippin and the other rich hobbits have gotten rich by selling weapons to both the Shire and Mordor. (??? so why do we care about saving the Shire if it's so corrupt?)\\n\\nAt the last moment Sam magically astral-projects himself (because everyone can have the power of elves now) to Hobbiton to distract the little-boy-turned-evil-monster-for-no-reason so that the remaining Hobbits and the new characters we don't care about can escape to Bree. The Shire burns to the ground.\\n\\nSam dies because he's tired.\\n\\nThe End\\n\\n\\nSo much for our beloved characters of Sam\\, Aragorn\\, and Arwen. And so much for the peaceful Middle Earth they fought to create and the Shire they fought to protect. It turned out to be as corrupt as present day America. So what's the point? What are we fighting for in this new trilogy? The critics who never had any emotional connection to the characters in LOTR\\, no reverence for Middle Earth or nostalgia for the Shire\\, think the movie is wonderful and edgy and pushing the story in a brave new direction. The millions of LOTR fans who are upset are labeled buttsore fanboys.\\n\\nI loved The Force Awakens\\, even though I was crushed by Han Solo's death. I cared about the new characters and their new story arcs and I understood what was done with Han. His story arc was actually pretty believable (who really thought he'd be content being a general in the new Republic or whatever for the rest of his life? He's Han Solo after all). And I understood the need for him to die. It solidified the evil in Kylo Ren. I figured the second movie would flush out Snoke's character and make us understand how he managed to corrupt Ben Solo\\, giving further weight to Han's death and Leia's heartbreak. Buuuut nope. Instead\\, we start from scratch again trying to convert Kylo\\, this time by FaceTiming with a cute girl. I actually liked those scenes because they developed the only real relationship between two characters that this movie has\\, but they also cheapened Han's death. If Kylo is still wavering after killing his own father (who is also one of our most beloved characters!) then what was the point of that death? Especially since we end the movie with Kylo going all evil again just like at the end of the first movie. \\n\\nAnd\\, of course\\, it goes without saying that Luke was completely done wrong\\, start to finish. The respect for the old characters that was so evident in The Force Awakens is gone in The Last Jedi. No one would tolerate such treatment of Aragorn\\, Arwen and Sam. \\n\\nOn top of that\\, the interest in the new characters is flattened because there are no real relationships between any of them. The budding friendship between Finn and Po is not progressed\\, Rey's friendships with Finn and BB8 are put on hold\\, Rey and Po don't even meet until the end of the movie. Kylo and Snoke's relationship comes to an abrupt and not-so-believable end. The tension between Kylo and Hux is gone because Hux is comic relief now. All the emotional connections set up in The Force Awakens are gone. \\n\\nThere is also no progression in the overall story of Star Wars\\, we're right back to where it all started. Small group of rebels fighting a big evil force. I don't understand all the talk about breaking tropes and branching out into new territory. There's no new storyline. We are literally back to the very beginning\\, with characters we don't know very well fighting an evil force that arose for reasons we don't understand. And just to make it worse\\, this time they're fighting to preserve a Republic that we now know is actually an oligarchy rife with injustice. Yay! Go rebels! (Don't even get me started on the lameness of injecting current modern day social justice issues into Star Wars. It's so jarring and just plain wrong\\, no matter how much I may agree with the sentiments politically)\\n\\nIf there were some tangible emotional relationships between the new characters and some movement in the overall story\\, some new direction with something interesting to look forward to\\, then it might have tempered our sadness at the degradation of the old characters. At least there would be a reason for it. Something to make us understand the need for it and come to terms with it. But there isn't. It was all for nothing. These characters were degraded and given tragic endings for the sole purpose of  \\\"subverting expectations.\\\" That is failed story telling.","true":true}
