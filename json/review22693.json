Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like Rian Johnson's Looper\\, The Last Jedi has serious issues of pacing and gaping holes of logic. Whoever signed off on this script needs to be fired.\\n\\nThere are nuggets of greatness in this movie. Unfortunately\\, you have to wade through too much crap to enjoy it. This movie is only slightly better than the Ep1\\,2\\,3 prequels. Worst of the recent three.","true":true}
