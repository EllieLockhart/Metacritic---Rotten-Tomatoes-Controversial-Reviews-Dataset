Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was like Rian Johnson knew what the fans wanted to see\\, and then did the exact opposite \\\"just because\\\".\\n\\nA real wasted opportunity to build on the highs of The Force Awakens and Rogue One. I struggle to see where the saga goes after this mess of a movie.","true":true}
