Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay- So... I'm really confused by the critics on this... and realized they have been bought. It wasn't awful-It is interesting fan fiction\\, but I don't care... nor do I believe. It feels tired and doesn't know where it is going\\, but will go with style and lots of money.","true":true}
