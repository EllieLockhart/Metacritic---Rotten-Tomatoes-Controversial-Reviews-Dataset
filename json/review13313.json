Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd rather watch Gigli with Jar Jar Binks playing J-Lo's role.   The last Jedi stinks worse than a Grandma's fart\\, and she caught us all with our mouths wide open.  Will be forced to pass on Solo since it would only bring back the TLJ sour taste in my mouth.  \\n\\nPS. Hey Disney since you guys have new Pixar characters\\, why dont you make Mickey irrelevant.  Maybe turn Mickey into a rat thats extremely unlikeable while he ponders murdering Huey Duey or Pluto while they sleep.  Mickey the Rat can molest Ursula's teets and drink some purple milk in Parks. Got to make room from the Frozen chick\\, so let the past die.","true":true}
