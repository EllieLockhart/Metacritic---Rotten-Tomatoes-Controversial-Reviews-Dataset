Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MAYBE \\\"OK\\\" as a movie\\, terrible as a Star Wars movie. Prank call from an X-Wing\\, flying Leah...just some of the crap-tastic scenes you can look forward to. Utter garbage...and I thought ep 7 was OK...Really enjoyed Rogue One. I am not anti new movies. This movie made me want to throw myself into a sarlaac pit.","true":true}
