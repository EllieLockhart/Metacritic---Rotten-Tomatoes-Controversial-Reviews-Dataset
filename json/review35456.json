Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi did what none of the prequels did... it made me stop caring about the franchise.  Why?  ...because the script seemed like it could have been written on the back of a napkin during a one hour visit to the local watering hole.  For those who say 'boo hoo... it didn't do the things YOU want so it's bad?'  -  No\\, that's absolutely not the case.  The Force Awakens didn't do the things I'd hoped for\\, and I still enjoyed it.  TLJ is a prime example of how NOT to tell a story.  It wasted our time with irrelevant bumbling.  It insulted our intelligence by making its most dramatic moment a slap in the face to logic\\, i.e. if you could hyper-ram a fleet to destroy it\\, there would have been fleets of drone hyper-rammers in existence throughout the franchise.\\n\\nDear JJ.  Please retcon this piece of garbage and truly melt our minds as Kevin Smith claims it will.","true":true}
