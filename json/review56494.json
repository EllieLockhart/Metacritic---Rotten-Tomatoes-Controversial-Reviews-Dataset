Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story want to please you. They want to hit familiar beats and remind you why you love Star Wars. They are so much fun. But The Last Jedi doesn't want to remind you of anything. It doesn't care about your relationship with Star Wars. The only relationship that matters here is Rian Johnson's relationship with Star Wars\\, and for the first time in a long time\\, here is a Star Wars movie with a proper point of view\\, one delivered by a storyteller who is unafraid to shatter a universe he loves\\, to break down the heroes that mean so much to him. A wise and noble Luke is easy. A Luke with regrets? That's hard. That's tough to swallow. That's what elevates The Last Jedi beyond a simple retread - it asks you to take these characters seriously in a way that other Star Wars films have not\\, to acknowledge them as something beyond a vessel for escapism. Star Wars can only matter in the long run if it's given the room to grow. And right now\\, it feels like the sky is the limit. Right now\\, Star Wars feels...unsafe. And that's great.","true":true}
