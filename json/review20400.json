Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand the gripes everyone has regarding the movie:\\n\\n- Snoke not being developed\\n- Weak Canto Bight plot\\n- Vice Admiral Holdo being useless (though I loved Laura Dern)\\n- Princess Leia being robbed an impactful death\\n\\nSo on and so forth. But as a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I loved it! It was compelling in certain scenes\\, beautifully shot\\, had amazing battle\/fight scenes\\, and the acting was some of the best I've seen so far.\\n\\nIs it perfect\\, nope. Did I enjoy it\\, hell yes!","true":true}
