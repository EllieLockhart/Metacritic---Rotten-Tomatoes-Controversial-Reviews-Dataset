Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete and total cinematic catastrophe. Sure\\, Rian Johnson had to make a follow up movie to JJ Abrams soft reboot of the original Star Wars\\, A New Hope. This limited him in who is characters were and what their struggles would be. But that's what happens when you sign on to write and direct a film IN A TRILOGY. It's just amazing that Kennedy allowed each movie\\, in a multi-billion dollar franchise\\, to not be planned out. They had no plan! This movie sucks so bad.","true":true}
