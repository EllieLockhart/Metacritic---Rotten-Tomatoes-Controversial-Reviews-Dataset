Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While having a few scenes that standout as the finest within the franchise\\, the film is disappointing. For such a long length\\, the film seems small\\, and wastes valuable time on pointless side plots involving sappy dialogue and unrelated animal welfare activism (both delivered by the uninspiring performance of Kelly Tran). Luke's portrayal is polarizing\\, and while decent in parts\\, feels like a betrayal of such a beloved and timeless character.  The threat of the First   Order is still unclear\\, as is the capacity of the estrogen -fueled Resistance\\, who duke it out in an original but at times underwhelming space chase. \\n\\nDaisy Ridley is compelling as Rey\\, and is given room to develop her character\\, though the reason the protagonist is still so powerful with the force remains irritatingly unclear. Her scenes shared with Adam Driver's Kylo Ren are the finest the film has to offer\\, giving intrigue and depth to the surprisingly compatible screen time. \\n\\nDomnhall Gleeson is scene-stealing as General Hux\\, even when the film takes to reducing him to fodder for comedy. He gives the villains more personality than that of the heroes\\, with cocky\\, snide\\, and authoritative\\,presence which shows why this imperial remnant has appeal.   \\n\\nFor the parts that are good\\, the film is an asset to the franchise. But there is unfortunate dissatisfaction left after leaving the cinema. As the film constantly alludes to\\, it can only be hoped that episode IX capitalizes on the good elements of this films\\, while leaving its flaws behind.","true":true}
