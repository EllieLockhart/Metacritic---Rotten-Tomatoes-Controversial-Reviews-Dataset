Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just wanted to include\\, that I'm not a bot or a troll or a part of the alt-right. I don't care if movies star women or minorities....I just want good stories. This movie was terrible and there are plenty of reviews as to why. I would be fine if this was a stand alone reboot and had nothing to do with the original trilogy. At this point\\, I do not care what happens next. May the force be with you....always","true":true}
