Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars film to date. It encompasses everything that isn't the classic Lucas creation\\, including overacting\\, cringe-worthy humor\\, uninspired dialogue\\, random direction in the plot\\, and terrible fight sequences. Almost immediately after the opening scene ended\\, I questioned why I even believed in Disney's new Star Wars trilogy in the first place. It's pathetic seeing newcomers such as Finn and Rose getting as much\\, if not more screen time than Luke Skywalker himself. This film is no continuation from the classics we learned to love. As a fan\\, I'm heartbroken that The Last Jedi hit theaters in this form. It was the biggest letdown\\, disappointment\\, catastrophe\\, you name it\\, to ever happen to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
