Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie. Loved nearly everything about it. It's about moving away from the old and starting a new. So if you're an OT super fan boy and didn't like episode 7 don't bother. Other than that I don't see why someone wouldn't like it.","true":true}
