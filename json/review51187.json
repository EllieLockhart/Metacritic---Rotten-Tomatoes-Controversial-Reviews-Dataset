Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it. It perfectly incorporated the original trilogy while still make a satisfying and brilliant movie that can stand on its own. Much better than 'The Force Awakens' and gives the 9th something to try and live up to. Definitely go see this movie!","true":true}
