Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When did the Star Wars franchise incorporate the talents of Mary Poppins?  Do the creators of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" understand basic physics (e.g. if I drop a bomb in a ZERO gravity environment\\, the chances are great that it will not hit a target located directly below me)? What is Fin's character arc? (answer\\, he doesn't have one). How did Rey become a full-fledged\\, battle-hardened Jedi Knight in less than one movie\\, when it took Luke Skywalker a full three movies to achieve supreme potency?....These are just a few (out of many) valid critiques I have regarding this abysmal film.  And one last item...the 91% that rated this film \\\"FRESH\\\".....what film were they watching???","true":true}
