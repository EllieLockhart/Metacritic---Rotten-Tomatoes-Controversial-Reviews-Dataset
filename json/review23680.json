Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luckily I'm not a Star Wars fan. If I was\\, I'd be mightily narked off by this poorly written mess of a film that seems to this that it\\, not the upcoming Episode IX\\, is the end of the Skywalker saga. Someone buy Kathleen Kennedy a whiteboard and some nice marker pens before it's too late.","true":true}
