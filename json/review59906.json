They pulled no punches I mean what did you think was going to happen to make Ellie snap her new gf dies **** no use your heads if you didn't see this coming you're just not observant look how the first game started... This is a once a generation game it's leaps and bounds above anything seen before the mechanics to the way Ellie moves and the contextual awareness is truly something. On a nice tv in 1000 but HDR glory it's eye meltingly delicious and I can't praise the team at naughty dog enough for the script the execution of everything it's truly a wonderful visceral violent in depth hate machine revenge story it's amazing. This is a 10\/10 make no mistake people are 2 hours in and review bombing that's just ignorant and you didn't make the game the creative choices here are bold new scary and ****ing intense. 1000% a must play experience both games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
