Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was severely disappointed in this film. For all it's talk of killing the past or evolving into something new\\, it reused many plot points and seemed to be an intentional slap in the face to anyone actually invested in the SW universe so far.","true":true}
