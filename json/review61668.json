Did they honestly think this political uninspired garbage is what people want? If you like this crap you're or easily pleased an sjw\/retard yourself or you didn't play a decent game in your whole life. Just like allWhat a horrible game... their first game was a masterpiece but once again a dev decides to push their politic agenda in people's throat and put all this sjw crap in their game. Did they honestly think this political uninspired garbage is what people want? If you like this crap you're or easily pleased an sjw\/retard yourself or you didn't play a decent game in your whole life. Just like all those critics praising every game crap or no crap\\, they proved it right here how they haven't any feeling for gaming anymore. It's really sad how more and more critics and devs are taking the sjw road\\, there should be no place for politics in games! And if this is how the future of gaming looks like i quit. Well at least tlou2 has beautiful graphics and scenery's but that's about it for pros... Luckily i experienced the golden years of gaming from the SEGA to N64 all the way to the ps3\\, one masterpiece after another. sadly kids will never understand and only know this crap.. poor them.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
