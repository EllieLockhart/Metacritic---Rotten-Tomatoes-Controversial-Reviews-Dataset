Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible and set in the wrong universe.  Star Wars universe had hyperspace not 'lightspeed'\\,  the fat asian chick was annoying\\, the purple haired menopausal \\\"admiral\\\" was vomit inducing\\, and Leya's superman flight is best forgotten.  No wonder Luke turned into a grumpy old fart\\, he had to share the galaxy with those twats.  Oh and whoever wrote the jokes is mentally stuck in the preschool's toilet.","true":true}
