Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most disappointing film since Phantom Menace.  This Star Wars film is a complete mess\\, and serves one purpose and one purpose only - Shove as many different types of things into a movie in order to sell toys and video games as possible.  With that being said\\, the other Star Wars movies are guilty of the same thing\\, but at least those films had purpose.  The Last Jedi handles Luke terribly and basically undoes everything from the previous movie for reasons that I do not understand.  Snoke is a joke with zero backstory\\, Ren's backstory is a throw away line or two\\, and Ren gives absolutely zero reason for anything he does and basically looks like an idiot the entire movie. \\n\\nAwful and disappointing\\, with way to much comedy thrown in.  A terrible misfire and this new trilogy is pretty much beyond hope at this point.","true":true}
