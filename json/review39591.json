Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film... Wow. I refuse to go into spoilers here so I might as well keep it short and sweet. This is a film defined by great moment after great moment. It truly has some of the most emotional \/ iconic scenes  out of any Star Wars films. It's not perfect\\, but the majority of the risks taken with this film pay off HUGE. \\n\\nI'm excited to see the final film in this trilogy\\, am ecstatic to see them pulling ideas and characters from the books and extra source materials and making them mean something on screen. This won't go down as the \\\"greatest Star Wars film of all time\\\"\\, but it certainly may go down as my personal favorite. I can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
