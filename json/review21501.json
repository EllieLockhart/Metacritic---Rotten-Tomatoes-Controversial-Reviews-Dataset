Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would not recommend this movie to anyone\\, especially not a real Star Wars fan.  The plot is unbelievably dumb and disjointed\\, the \\\"humor\\\" is unbearable and undermines the novelty of the franchise\\, and there is just too much random dumb stuff throughout the movie (such as Luke drinking alien titty milk).  Who was Snoke?  I guess it's surprising that he dies\\, but I hardly care.  Same for Phasma.  Princess Leia as Mary Poppins\/ space witch?  Dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Casino world?? What an utter waste of time.  Rian Johnson has proved himself to be a talentless hack\\, this movie made me sick. SAD!","true":true}
