Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In order for a franchise to keep going\\, they need to take risks at some point\\, and that's what this movie did. The Last Jedi is the best SW film since Return of the Jedi\\, even with all its flaws. I'd rather see elements of the SW universe that I haven't seen before than pay for the same re-tread plot elements and imagery again and again.","true":true}
