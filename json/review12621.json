Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't take these low reviews seriously. I just watched this with my mom\\, dad\\, and sister who are all big star wars fans we all left the theater believing this to be the best star wars movie we had ever seen\\, there were one or two parts I found couldve been better such as the casino planet part but otherwise the movie was amazing. Disney has realized their starwars fanbase is not just 7 year old kids this film \\\"forces\\\" you too use your brain. Me and my dad are gonna go see it again its that good.","true":true}
