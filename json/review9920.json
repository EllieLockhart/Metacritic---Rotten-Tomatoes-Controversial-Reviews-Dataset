Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great effects\\, score and audio; terrible everything else.  I've watched a number of reviews and unlike some other fans I'm not so upset about dropping bombs in space and things of that nature.  It's star wars.  They have crazy technology and it's not the most absurd thing in saga.  What made me so angry was failed character development\\, sjw and feminist agenda riddled throughout the film (to the point where it was obnoxious and took away from the story)\\, ill timed humor\\, incontinuity with the rest of the saga including the force awakens and itself\\, pointless subplots with no development\\, and again political BS throughout the film.  Snowflakes in Hollywood are ruining everything.","true":true}
