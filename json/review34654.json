Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography was amazing as well as the sound effects. The acting was also very well done. This doesnt make up for the fact that the movie is poorly written with major plotholes and pointless additions. Somehow Luke sees the good in one of the most evil men in the galaxy\\, but he almost kills his nephew because of what he might do? This makes no sense. Also there was zero attempt to make additions to utilize or tie anything into existing star wars lore. Its clear Dave Filoni should be in charge of lucas films not Kathleen Kennedy.","true":true}
