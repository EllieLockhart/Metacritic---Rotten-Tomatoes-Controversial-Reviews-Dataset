Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was excited for it but man it was just bad. Looked great but that's about it. Action was boring and uninspired. Terrible story directions with Luke. Introduced an interesting Snoke but just wasted. Loved pretty much every other one. This was just bad.","true":true}
