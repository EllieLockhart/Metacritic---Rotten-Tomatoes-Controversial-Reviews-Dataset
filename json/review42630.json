Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was brilliant and took risks. Definitely a few minor things that were meh\\, but overall it was compelling\\, funny and beautiful. The low audience reviews are extremely nitpicky.","true":true}
