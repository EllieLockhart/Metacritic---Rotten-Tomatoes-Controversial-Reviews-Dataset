Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Barely worth seeing. The plot is forced and half baked. The acting is awful. This screams of a movie that was rushed out to make money for Disney but didn\u2019t bother spending the time to write a story that honors the original Star Wars trilogy let alone make you fall in love with the new characters.
