Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually beautiful\\, the actors did a wonderful job with what they were given\\, but the multiple plot lines fell flat. They had a lot of good they could have done\\, and in the end\\, it just felt unfinished and poorly exectuted. \\n\\nI will be disappointed if the writer\/director (they were the same person) isn't blacklisted for the utter crap they inflicted on me and my wife. We're both huge fans of the original trilogy and the expanded universe.","true":true}
