Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An epic film that takes chances\\, risks and challenges all the things we know and love about Star Wars\\, Rian Johnson is the true star of the show here with a unique sense of directing taking the story of Star Wars to whole new levels never before seen. Loved it.","true":true}
