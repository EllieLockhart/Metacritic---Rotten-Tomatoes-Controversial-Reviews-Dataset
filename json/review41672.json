Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just terrible. Since the whole Disney\/Star Wars experiment has been a cash grab\\, why didn't disney ride the horse of the old characters for as long as they could? What's the point of buying Star Wars only to kill Luke Skywalker? Give us a movie or two where the Jedi master is causing some major mayhem in the universe. The only reason anyone liked Rogue One was because of that 2 second scene where Darth Vader slaughters a whole ship full of rebels. Duh Disney! That's what people want to see? Get your Billion back that way. You aren't making \\\"art\\\" here\\, no matter what the critics you've paid off are willing to type about you. What a lost opportunity. I have seen my last theatrical Star Wars release.","true":true}
