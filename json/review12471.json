Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot get my head around this critic score at all. Yes: the film has a terrific score from John Williams\\, it's well acted all around\\, has some tense scenes and very impressive visual sequences. Since when did any of that make up for a shoddy plot with more holes than solid points\\, sloppy dialogue and distracting tone problems though. I thought that critics were supposed to value substance over style! Or at least value the two equally?\\n\\nThis film manages to ruin a good 80% of everything interesting it had to work with. Not only does it ruin beloved characters from the original trilogy\\, but also almost all of the mystery and intrigue set up in The Force Awakens. It seems like Rian Johnson wanted so much to create a subversive plot\\, that he did so at as many points as possible\\, and to the detriment of any semblance of continuity or character. Entire character motivations and stories are written off simply to drive the plot forward into the next unexpected twist. While there are effective scenes in this film around the characters of Rey and Kylo Ren\\, everything else in the film is riddled with plot holes and badly executed.\\n\\nI was actually hugely looking forward to this film being subversive\\, as I thought that after the 'play it safe' nostalgia fest that was The Force Awakens\\, Star Wars could finally be original. However it has so many identical scenes in homage to scenes from Empire\\, Return and even A New Hope\\, that it also manages to be unoriginal.","true":true}
