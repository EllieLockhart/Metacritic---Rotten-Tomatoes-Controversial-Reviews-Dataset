Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible\\, Force Awakens and Rogue One got my expectations up though this was utter garbage and should be redone. Cinematography bad\\, script weak with many holes\\, editing was amateur at best and worst of all\\, erased the entire aura of every past SW movie. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself","true":true}
