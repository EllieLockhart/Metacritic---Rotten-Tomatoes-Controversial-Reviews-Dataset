Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"TL;DR: You can pass on this one\\, watch on youtube if you wan't to know the story.\r\r=======================================================================\r\rGreat graphics. nuff said\\, One of the best looking PS4 game.\r\rGameplay\\, its the same with minor improvement from the original game. And after you play it for 20 hours\\, it become boring and tedious. AI still dumb\r\rStory\\, well its revenge story\\, bad one that is. Compared to the original game\\, this one feels unlike the unique \\\"human\\\" side of the post apocalyptic story the original game had. And this game even try to drag the playtime to agonizing hours of playing character you don't know and probably don't care at all. All i want is the dynamic relationship between elie and joel which -fortunately- i still can enjoy through the flashback scenes.\r\rOverall\\, i feel disappointed\\, i wish the leak aren't true\\, i refuse to beliefe it from the bottom from my heart. They throw away what i love from the first game and give me cringy coming of age revenge story. Mediocre naughty dog\\, mediocre.\r\rGameplay 3\/10 (nothing new\\, same old thing\\, generic stealth mechanic)\rGraphics 9\/10 (One of the most beautiful PS4 game ever)\rStory 3\/10 (This score for the flashback scenes)\rReplay value 1\/10 (Play it once means you done with the game\\, hell you dont even need to buy the game to enjoy the story)\r\rVerdict 4\/10 - I just wasted $60 for experience i can enjoy from letsplay youtube video.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
