Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok I liked this film at first but in retrospect I haven\u2019t been interested in seeing this film after my first view and when I force myself to see it again\\, it\u2019s a total bore. The problem with the film is the unnecessary journey taken to the casino island which is soo pointless. Also\\, I wasn\u2019t happy that the director\\, Rian Johnson didn\u2019t connect the events of the first movie to this one. We still don\u2019t have Snokes or Rey\u2019s backstories and for Gods sake\\, why on earth would you make the greatest Jedi who ever lived act like a bratty child on the island and then kill him off at the end of the film? Terrible decisions by a terrible director made this one of the WORST Star Wars movies ever. I gave it 2 stars for the fight scene between Rey and Kyle against Snokes men. ","true":true}
