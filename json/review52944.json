Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An utter betrayal of everything that was painstakingly created by George Lucas and the Original Trilogy's cast\/staff. So afraid of itself that it serves to sabotage any semblance of mythos that \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" had built all for the sake of cheap thrills and manipulative storytelling. The Prequel Trilogy may have been flawed but it had heart and ambition; a direct antithesis to the self-deprecating writing and characterization depicted in this film. If you didn't think that Star Wars died at any point in time before\\, this entry serves to definitively mark itself in history as the final nail in the coffin.","true":true}
