Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not Star Wars.  Good visuals. Shock for shock value.  Politics get in the way whatever your view.  Not Disney's or Star Wars best move\\, in fact it destroys the franchise not only on the judgement of this movie but what it enabled to happen next.","true":true}
