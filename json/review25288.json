Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No depth no development plot made no sense if you can calldo that a plot. Cool cgi and cinematography is why it gets 1 star. Seems like they dont care about any of the previous saga and are just going to make bland stories from now on hopefully JJ fixes it with 9.","true":true}
