Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the best Star Wars film I've seen since the 80s.  It's a tad too long but has a lot to explore and unpack in its run time.  Fascinating developments and changes to what has unfortunately come to be expected of the franchise.  Embracing the new while also paying respect to that which has gone before fans\\, both new and old could not have asked for a better film in our current milieu.","true":true}
