Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Avoided spoilers and Theories as much as possible coming in to this movie. No reviews\\, nothing to shape my expectations except 1 trailer. I was stunned on how bad the writing was and at certain points I just stared at the screen in disbelief. Only reason I watched the whole movie was because I hope it would do a Rogue One and get awesome in the end but sadly it just wrecked the ENTIRE STAR WARS UNIVERSE EVEN MORE!! Only reason people can delude themselves in to this being a good movie is because of the huge budget this movie had. If you just downgrade the music and visuals a tiny notch people would start hating this movie instead of get blinded by it.","true":true}
