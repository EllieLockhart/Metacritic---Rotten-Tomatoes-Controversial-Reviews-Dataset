Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love this movie! \\nI understand the flaws people are saying\\, but I love the new cast of characters and think the movies are so fun so I'm able to overlook the flaws. Also\\, this is the middle movie\\, it's bound to be unpopular and cursed. Rey and Kylo are amazing to watch. I cheered with the whole audience during this movie when it first came out.","true":true}
