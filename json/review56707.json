Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most insulting star wars movie ever made. I as a hardcore fan despised this movie for its cobtradiction of lore\\, the underwhelming death of admiral ackbar and the character assassination of luke skywalker. Not only that but the movie is filled with horing locales and stupid new editions such as rose who is basically a victim of severe autism and holdo\\, the most incompetent military leader since admiral Constantine. And the worst part is that a friend of mine who was jot a star wars fan hated it\\, my casual star wars fans hated it\\, a friend of mine saw TFA before watching this movie and thought it was trash. The truth is the majority of people hated this movie and  goddamn the people who do love this film or aggresive about their opinions\\, this movie destroyed a fandom and a franchise\\, if solo is ripe with sjw messages and character assassinations like this one it will be the death of star wars.","true":true}
