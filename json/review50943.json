Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute insult to the Luke Skywalker of the original trilogy and to the ideals and values we grew up seeing in Star Wars.\\n\\nIf this wasn't about beloved characters it would be likable enough as a stand alone science fiction action film\\, but given the legacy it stems from there is just no excuse for how this film fails its audience.","true":true}
