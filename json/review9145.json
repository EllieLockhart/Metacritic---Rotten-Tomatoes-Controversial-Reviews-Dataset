Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun if you aren't up to the actual lore and history of the Star Wars universe. If you actually know about the characters and how the force works this movie is horrible. Also the constant humor and jokes are just out of place and dumb. It abandons plots from the force awakens and reasons for ALL characters actions make no sense.","true":true}
