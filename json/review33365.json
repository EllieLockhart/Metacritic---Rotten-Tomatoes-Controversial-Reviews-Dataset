Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SW: The Last Jedi\\, was almost everything i wanted to see in the previous episode: new faces\\, a fresher plot\\, lots of action\\, etc.\\nHowever (personally) with the disaster that was episode 7 (originality-wise)\\, 8 had a though job to fullfill\\, which i believe\\, payed off almost expectacularly\\, with mayor twists and character development taking place in this almost 3 hours length production\\, however i cannot overlook some of it's issues like Snoke's dissapointing lack of... origin? and let's not forget about that whole ruined sacrifice near the end. Although\\, the one powerful scene that came after it touched my heart\\, and made me cry tears of sadness and joy. So in the end\\, i believe this movie is worthy of a final sequel. I just HOPE that someone can abrige it's predecesor so we can forget the whole \\\"Episode 4 Emulation\\\" that it was.","true":true}
