Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was beautifully done! I have seen it twice! I cried and I laughed. I loved. The way yoda looked! I loved the figh scenes. I thought it was executed beautifully! I completely do t understand what the heck these haters are complaining about! It had everything I wanted and more! I have watched Star Wars all my life and I really don't feel they could have done anything better! 10 stars! My favorite one yet!","true":true}
