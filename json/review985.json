Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An opportunity to create something very special was missed. Luke Skywalker's character was rewritten to fit a poorly contrived plot. Carrie Fisher is pushed to the side lines and under used in what should have been her final moment to shine. The humour is forced and falls flat\\, completely missing the mark. I came away from this film feeling insulted and angry that such an incompetent director had been allowed free reign to push a political agenda and create his own personal version of star wars. The fans are what have made the franchise so lucrative\\, and this is how Disney rewards them. George Lucas should never have sold out. So so sad. I will not be going to see any more Star Wars movies. It really is time for the Jedi to end.","true":true}
