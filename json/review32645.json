{"101487":170218,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is filled with cheap humor\\, awful dialogue\\, a meandering plot\\, and decidedly lackluster action. \\n\\nSUPER SPOILER SECTION HIGHLIGHTS \\n(But can you really spoil something that\u00e2(TM)s already rotten?)\\nBut seriously\\, MAJOR SPOILERS\\n\\nLeia goes all Mary Poppins y\u00e2(TM)all during a quick space nap so she can deliver a few more lines later in the movie\\, but don\u00e2(TM)t worry\\, no one will talk about it. \\n\\nLuke approaches some sort of space manatee basking on the beach with its four bulbous udders hanging out. He milks it\\, drinks the green goo it produced\\, offers it to Rey\\, and the space manatee looks her directly in the eye like a dramatic groundhog.\\n\\nSpace pigeons\\, I mean porgs\\, infest the Millennium Falcon\\, so Chewie is forced to cook a few up\\, but their puppet-looking selves wimper at him enough to convince him to let their friends go to waste instead. \\n\\nFinn and a new character\\, Rose\\, run off on the purest boondoggle in movie history by facetiming Maz for info on a codebreaker that they fail to find so they come back with the first person they meet and still fail their mission\\, but don\u00e2(TM)t worry\\, they really stuck it to those rich folks\\, by letting some slave children release their beasts upon the town. \\n\\nDarth BB8\\n\\nLuke whines about the force\\, but also gives Rey a pep talk about the forces so she\u00e2(TM)s all good now on the force thing. She\u00e2(TM)s basically got her The Force GED so she\u00e2(TM)s set. \\n\\nRey trashes Luke\u00e2(TM)s retirement island so some muppet fish-nuns have to come out of the woodworks and clean it up for them. \\n\\nRey tries to talk to a creepy mirror in a pit\\, but it\u00e2(TM)s like \u00e2Nah\\, I\u00e2(TM)m just a creepy mirror in a pit\\, yo.\u00e2?\\n\\nSnoke is extremely powerful. Jk Snoke\u00e2(TM)s dead. Fans: But who was he? Rian Johnson: Eh...\\n\\nAll in all\\, The Last Jedi veers from the earnest epic that is Star Wars into a self-deprecating snooze fest where everyone is either whining\\, repeating another character\\, or stating what they\u00e2(TM)ve decided is the next part of their inane quest. I\u00e2(TM)d like to say the action was still good\\, but it really wasn\u00e2(TM)t. Give me Darth Maul and some \u00e2There\u00e2(TM)s always a bigger fish\u00e2?\u00c2?\\, over some dudes in red dresses flailing their fancy electric whips and Luke literally milking a space manatee in front of us.","true":true}
