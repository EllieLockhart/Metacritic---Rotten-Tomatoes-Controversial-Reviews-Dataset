Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With every scene keeping the viewer on their toes\\, The Last Jedi finally does something that makes the Sequel Trilogy worth making: take risks.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens wasn't without risks\\, of course. A female lead\\, with two men of color in supporting roles was quite risky with fans -- but the story beats were familiar\\, and followed the path laid out by the triumphs of previous Star Wars films.\\n\\nHowever\\, the through-line that ties The Last Jedi together is dismantling concept of heroism that Star Wars and tales like it have touted as the ultimate experience. You want to be Luke because he saves the day with his mystic powers and his laser sword\\, fighting bad guys head on and raising your head at the end of the day as a victor. But is it healthy to put a vague sense of heroism before anything else?\\nThe Last Jedi says: no\\, mindless heroism gets you killed\\, and puts others in unnecessary danger. We see this in Poe's arrogance\\, and Finn's attempt at a suicide mission to stop The First Order. We even see this in Rey\\, who thinks that becoming a Jedi will immediately solve all her problems\\, when in reality\\, the teachings of the Jedi are more conflicted.\\n\\nLuke\\, the hero every child looked up to\\, snaps our heroes and the viewers out of this daze of hero-romanticism. He talks about the harshness of being a hero\\, of being someone who does something dangerous without thinking\\, and how those actions created monsters like Kylo Ren.\\n\\nThe spark that lights the fire of the Resistance is not how we harm our enemies\\, but how we help each other. Messages of vague heroism were once fun and necessary\\, but in a day and age where suffering comes in all forms\\, it's important to remember that saving each-other must come before harming our enemies.\\n\\nIt's a huge leap for something like Star Wars to take\\, but I'm so glad it did.","true":true}
