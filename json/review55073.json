Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve waited to put this up\\, especially as there\u2019s a lot of negativity about this film. I\u2019ve read the original empire strikes back reviews and they go along a similar vein. It\u2019s too long. That\u2019s my biggest criticism\\, but apart from that\\, it\u2019s a great film. Sure it\u2019s a similar story to before (rag tag band of revels fire a big nasty empire)\\, but this is clearly trying to make a leap away from this\\, ready for something different. I thought Luke was especially well done. ","true":true}
