Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is an absolute huge steaming pile of garbage. There are too many cutscenes and boring walking sections in this game. This isn't even a game\\, this is a movie. The story is by far the worst story I ever seen in a videogame. There are too many plot holes and it is poorly written. The dialogue is extremely cringeworthy. The characters are bland and cringeworthy as well.\r\rTheThis game is an absolute huge steaming pile of garbage. There are too many cutscenes and boring walking sections in this game. This isn't even a game\\, this is a movie. The story is by far the worst story I ever seen in a videogame. There are too many plot holes and it is poorly written. The dialogue is extremely cringeworthy. The characters are bland and cringeworthy as well.\r\rThe gameplay is so boring and repetitive. The developers were too cheap and lazy to overhaul the gameplay\\, despite multiple delays. The level design is a joke. The physics are trash and the gore is exaggerated\\, which breaks immersion. Speaking of immersion\\, the AI is incredibly stupid in this game. There are very little puzzles and all of them are lazily designed. The running animations are laughable.\r\rThe pacing is so horrendous in this game\\, it almost put me to sleep out of boredom. The developer who directed this movie game even admitted that they don't use the word \\\"fun\\\". If their goal was to not make the game fun\\, then they nailed it. It's pathetic that game developers don't even want games to be fun anymore. If I'm not mistaken\\, games are suppose to be fun. That is the reason why I even play videogames in the first place. There is so much SJW influence in this game.\r\rThere is no multiplayer at all. So once you beat the story\\, there is not a reason to touch this game again. It will go back to the shelf and collect dust. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cashgrab. The greedy developers are basically charging $60 for a movie ticket. They promised there would be multiplayer and decided to cut it out. The developers were too greedy and lazy to develop multiplayer. The only good thing in this game is graphics\\, but the graphics sacrificed the gameplay mechanics. I don't recommend this worthless game at all.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
