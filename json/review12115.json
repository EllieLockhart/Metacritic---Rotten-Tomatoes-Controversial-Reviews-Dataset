Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a fan of star wars for more than 30 years\\, I've been collecting star wars for 30 years\\, I have more than 500 figures.\\nAfter seeing star wars 8 \\, I was very disappointed\\, I wanted to throw all my star wars collection. Star wars 8 last jedi is not a star wars\\,\\nI will never see again star wars 8. And I will not buy this movie in blue-ray or figurines .\\nFor me\\, Star wars stopped at episode 7. Star wars 7 the force awakens was a reboot but is staying in the star wars universe.\\nAll the defects of this movie were quoted already in several criticisms. \\n40 years of expectations to see:\\n-Luke throws the light saber\\, Luke drinking milk (really horrible)\\, Luke goes fishing\\, the final battle with Kylo (ridiculous)\\n-Leia flying\\,\\n-Who is snoke ?\\, Ren's knight ?\\, SnoKe's death (ridiculous)\\, Luke's death (ridiculous)\\, and\\nThe planet casino (ridiculous)\\,the origins of Rey(ridiculous)\\, Finn and Rose (ridiculous)\\,too much humor\\, the storyline is ridiculous ect ...\\nplanet Crai = Hot\\nSnoke killed by Kylo = Empror Killed by Vador\\n\\nRian Jonhson killed star wars and his fans\\, The last jedi is the worst star wars.\\nI will  not see the the next trilogy if Rian Jonhson is the director.\\nWithout fans\\, there is no star wars.","true":true}
