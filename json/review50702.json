Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(92\/100)\\nThe Last Jedi is very controversial for me. I like it but dislike it at the same time. There's stuff I really do not like but the things I like overshadow the things I don't.","true":true}
