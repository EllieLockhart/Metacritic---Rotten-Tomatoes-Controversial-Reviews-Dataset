Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well they kinda chopped that up... Not sure if they can fix that mess. ?? Entertaining at times\\, but overall pretty disappointing. Definitely took a step backwards considering how good Force Awakens was.... Had to come back and vent more. The more I think about it the madder I get. Wasted two years waiting for this movie.","true":true}
