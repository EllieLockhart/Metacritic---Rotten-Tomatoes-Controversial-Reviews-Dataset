Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the movie I expected but the movie the franchise needed. It was unpredictable and different from all other Star Wars films. Most people don't want change but I sit on it for a few days and this could open up a lot of possibilities for Episode IX.","true":true}
