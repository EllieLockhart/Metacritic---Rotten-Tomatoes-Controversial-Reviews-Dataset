Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mysteries that were introduced in the last film are either ignored or casually dismissed with indifference. That\\, coupled with some really misplaced humor\\, makes this Star Wars the weakest entry into the ongoing saga. Gone are the days of storytelling\\, here are the days of being a glorified toy commercial.","true":true}
