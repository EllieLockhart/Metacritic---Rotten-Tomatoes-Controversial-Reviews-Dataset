Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Killing Snoke was a big mistake. He was basically the only interesting\\, mystic and powerful character in this new trilogy. Now we are left with emo Kylo Ren as the main bad guy who has already been beaten by Rey in episode 7 with no training at all. The thought of having another Kylo Ren vs Rey battle in the final episode does not make it exciting at all.","true":true}
