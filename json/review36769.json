Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movies attempts to pay homage to the past fall flat when the movie dumps on mainstays like Luke\\, has long-winded plot lines to showcase new characters which do nothing to advance the main story\\, but still just rehashes similar scenarios in the same movie\\, it's hard to take it seriously\\, or at all.","true":true}
