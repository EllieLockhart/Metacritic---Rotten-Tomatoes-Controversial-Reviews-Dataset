Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is the most pathetic film to ever call itself 'Star Wars.' The Force Awakens was lazy\\, but watchable. This film utterly ruined whatever slight interest the Force Awakens made. Snoke dies\\, Luke dies\\, Leia didn't die\\, Kylo is an undeveloped waste\\, and Rey is even more of a Mary Sue than she was in the Force Awakens. Nothing is answered. Rey's heritage is burshed aside\\, literally referred to as \\\"nothing.\\\" Kylo get no development\\, and is still shown up by Rey. Snoke literally gets no story\\, and is instead left to rot. Luke is so poorly written\\, that the term 'character assassination' doesn't even begin to describe the shit writing. If you care about the integrity of this franchise- DON'T WATCH ANY OF THE NEW FILMS IN CINEMA. DON'T BUY THEIR MERCHANDISE. DON'T SUPPORT THEIR TV SHOWS. thank you.","true":true}
