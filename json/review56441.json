Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film misses a great opportunity to drive the Story forward in a meaningful direction. Instead it relies on unnecessarily subverting expectations as a gimmick. The emotional moments don't land because they are immediately nullified by cheap jokes and the jokes themselves aren't funny because they throw you out of the movie\\, not fitting at all into the context.\\n\\nBesides\\, the film also changes character motivation just for the sake of plot\\, betraying what could have been interesting character arcs. The different plot meanwhile seem like quests out of a video game\\, making the star wars universe feel generic and for the first time actually really small and boring.","true":true}
