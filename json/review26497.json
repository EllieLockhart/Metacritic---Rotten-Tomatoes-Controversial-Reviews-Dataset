Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Odd humor\\, could have given Carrie an honorable exit\\, side stories are pointless\\, connection between Rey and Kylo was just weird\\, Kylo is too weak\\, Snoke is too easily killed\\, Luke Skywalker was not Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
