Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is an entertaining movie\\, but Disney make seriously big mistakes. Just to mention the largest mistakes. They change Luke Skywalker to an unknown old bitter man. Definitely not Luke Skywalker. Actually they waste two episodes. Ep. 7 is about finding Luke Skywalker. Ep. 8 shows this is a waste due to he is an old bitter man who will not participate. And when he does. All he can do is making a hologram of him self and then he die. So they wasted two episodes. I'm not sure the writer have seen episode 4\\, 5\\, 6 and 7. Further why do they not make a new innovative story. All they can do is copy stuff from the old trilogy and twist the best from these episodes. I don't want twist of the same. I want a new exciting adventure in the Star Wars saga. What a waste.","true":true}
