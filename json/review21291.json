Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations.The Force Awakens wasn't terrible\\, but I didn't see how they could set this SW up effectively\\, and I was right. They completely butchered Luke. They didn't show ANY character progression. Who the hell is Snoke? How did he create an empire so quickly? They even screw up the powers of the force\\, which has been consistent in all the previous movies. Don't get me started on the ending scene with Finn and Rose. That scene made zero sense\\, like much of the movie. \\nAs a life-long fan this movie infuriates me. It just seems Disney had an agenda to push and went after the paycheck. \\nI  created an account just to post this\\, after seeing the critic ratings.","true":true}
