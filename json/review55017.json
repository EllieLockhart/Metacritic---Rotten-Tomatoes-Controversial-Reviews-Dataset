Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It will be interesting to see how Disney and Lucasfilm handle the franchise moving forward. Kathleen Kennedy has made money for the parent\\, but there's no question the financial results of TLJ have been disappointing-- Domestic box office under performed\\, the Chinese market rejected the movie out of hand\\, and toy sales have been soft.\\n\\nIn response\\, Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson\\, and now JJ Abrahms have decided their next best move is to double down on their attacks on the fan base for not being woke enough or whatever to deal with their 'bold choices'. Hard to see how trashing the base will produce long term success. This is especially true since TLJ failed not just with the base\\, but with casual viewers as well. Many media outlets have provided Disney cover on TLJ\\, characterizing the movie as divisive when it's more accurate to say the audience overwhelmingly hated it. Are you listening Rotten Tomatoes?\\n\\nTLJ is a creative as well as a financial disappointment. One salient example: Rian Johnson stated he \\\"literally could not imagine\\\" another response by Luke other than to toss his long lost lightsaber over his shoulder. I don't know about the rest of you but I can think of about 100 responses that would have set the stage for an interesting and creative movie. Johnson's choice\\, which is hopelessly out of possibility for the Luke character\\, speaks volumes to his lack of creativity\\, Kennedy's inability to see that transforming Luke's character into a bum is not \\\"honoring\\\" the original storyline\\, and an overall the lack of understanding or outright hostility to the source material by the production and creative teams. \\n\\nIt's morally and creatively bankrupt. A complete trainwreck that's probably done lasting damage to the saga.\\n\\nDon't be surprised to see Disney cut ties with Kennedy after episode 9","true":true}
