Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"40% of this movie was great with the tense drama and the greying of lines for some characters. BUT\\, 60% of it was commentary and propaganda dragging a sci-fi fantasy (escapist fiction) movie into real world drama and politics. I like Star War and I like Rian Johnson\\, but they don't belong together\\, not even in the same galexy.","true":true}
