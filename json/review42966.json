Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible.  From Poe's crank call to Snoke's whatever-death it was just garbage.  There is obviously no continuity or overarching plan for this trilogy.  It's no surprise that the NBC-owned Rotten Tomatoes rated this movie so highly; it's also not a surprise that the audience score tells the REAL tale of how this movie was.  Less than 50% of the people who saw it liked it.  Thanks for crashing the most iconic movie series of all time.  Complete trash","true":true}
