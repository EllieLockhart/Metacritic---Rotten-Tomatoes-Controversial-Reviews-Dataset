Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want my movie back.  \\nDisney Blew it. \\nSnoke without a back story is a jar jar binks piss poor character.  Very unsatisfactory not exposing the story how Kylo was turned and who snoke was.  Not enough time between ep6 and ep7 for an unknown supreme leader to emerge from nowhere?   \\nWhere was he when sidous rules the galaxy?\\n\\nUnforgivable failure of Disney \\nThey had the chance to make a great movie but missed. \\n\\nThey have several major reveal setups and blew everyone of them.  \\nThey setup the perfect send off to Leia character then reversed it.   ???!! What the hell are they thinking?\\nThen\\nRey's parents images should have been clear in the cave sequence.  \\nHan and Leia.  \\nThe only senecio that makes sense is leia gets pregnant mysteriously \\\"not Han's\\\" he leaves them.  Young kylo acts up at age 5 leia takes him to luke then to train.  That's when he discovers his grandfather identity.  \\nLeia brings kylo and a new born girl \\\"Rey \\\" to Luke so Leia can continue the fight.   \\n\\nCould have been a great movie but failed to deliver.  \\n\\nNext time Disney I suggest you screen it with original fans before you continue to run Star Wars into the ground.  \\n\\nOriginal Fan 7 in 1977","true":true}
