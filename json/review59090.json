We clearly sense that he does not like the characters he created at all. He does not treat Joel and Ellie as his children\\, but just tools that he can use to spread and teach us his own values. We gamers love Joel and Ellie\\, Neil does not. This is also a lesson for all directors. We pay $60 to buy your game\\, we want to have fun\\, we want to enjoy a story. We are not paying our hard earned money to be taught by your own values. If you want to teach us what to do\\, say that on your own blog\/twitter\/YouTube channel\\, do not use a game that is created by and the cumulative result of hundreds of hard working and under payed people.\r\rTo the spoil leaker\\, you are the hero.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
