Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Director Rian Johnson wrote the script for Last Jedi alongside Palpatine and his Sith vision of the world where strength and the Black Side are not so different here. Forget everything you knew about the mythology of Star Wars. This movie throws everything in the trash\\, although the presentation is flawless. It's a nice piece of poop.","true":true}
