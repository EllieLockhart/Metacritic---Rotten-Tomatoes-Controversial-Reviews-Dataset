Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While some questions that Force Awakens posed were answered weakly and without much ado\\, I feel that certain aspects were deeply satisfying and have propelled the story forward. The chemistry between the characters is phenomenal and the acting was superb. I enjoyed it and will watch it over and over again despite some lackluster writing offered up by Rian Johnson (thank God J.J. is writing and directing episode IX).","true":true}
