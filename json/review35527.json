Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has some odd moments and issues with pacing\\, but offers one of the most dynamic and emotional Star Wars stories that pushes the plot and characters in new directions and gives some of the best moments in the saga and is the boldest\\, most visually impressive\\, and deepest Star Wars movie to date.","true":true}
