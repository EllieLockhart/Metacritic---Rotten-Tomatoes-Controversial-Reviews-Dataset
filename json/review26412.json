Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not worth it.  Would give it 0 stars if I could. Only Star Wars movie that I have seen once and not watched again.  I can't get myself to see it again as anything I can think of doing is still better than wasting another 2 hours on this movie. The other crappy thing is that it left such a bad taste in my mouth for Star Wars in general that I haven't gotten myself to go see Solo either.  Save your time and watch something else.","true":true}
