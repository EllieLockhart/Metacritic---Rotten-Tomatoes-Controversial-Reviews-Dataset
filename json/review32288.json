Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars finally has more than one strong female character. Great visuals. Puppet Yoda returns. Luke sends a Force-holo of himself to keep Kylo-Ren from destroying the Resistance.  Great fight choreography in the K & Rey vs. Snoke's guards battle. Lots of humor. And showing the next generation of rebels at the end (the boy uses the Force to grab his broom\\, watches the MF go to light speed among the stars\\, and wears Rose's ring with the Rebel Alliance symbol).  Can't understand why audience  rated this so low.","true":true}
