Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It lacks the visual impact of other movies\\, right from the opening.  Ever since Disney took over\\, force users have their powers right from the start rather then having to develop them over years-SMH  This story is being compared to being as good as Empire but it's obvious it's trying to BE Empire.  Serious lack of creativity and writing.  Normally I would see the movie in various formats from 2D-Dolby and Imax but once was enough this time.","true":true}
