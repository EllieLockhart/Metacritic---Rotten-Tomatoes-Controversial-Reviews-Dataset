Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not happy with this film at all. I understand that they want to empower women but it went to far. The message really took away from what Star Wars used to be. I'm terribly disappointed and Luke sky Walker was a huuuuuuuge let down. They really should have done better.","true":true}
