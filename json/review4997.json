Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Could some of the screen time been better spent? Yes. However I can see why the director made the choice he did. Personally I love this movie. I've seen it in theaters twice and I'll be buying the Blu-Ray as soon as it's available.","true":true}
