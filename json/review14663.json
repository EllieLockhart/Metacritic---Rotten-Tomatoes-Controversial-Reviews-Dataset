Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have mixed thoughts on this one. As excited as I was too see it\\, i left a bit underwhelmed. I liked some of the direction\\, but to many questions & subplots.  Could have cut 30 min out and had a great movie. \\n\\nHow is Rey operating so strong in the Force with virtually no training.  Did Luke teach her to levitate rocks?  What was the point of Canto Bight & Maz\\\"s scene?  The cave? The rickety speeders on Crait supposed to threaten those walkers? When did Leia become Star-Lord?  The Force can keep you from freezing instantly in space? Humor felt forced at times. Phasma completely wasted. \\n\\nI liked the twists\\, the battles were epic\\, Rey\/Kylo dynamic got interesting\\, Adm. Holdo's decision\\, big finale was cool\\, return of old favorites. Visually it was stunning. \\n\\nAs a big SW fan\\, I generally enjoyed it\\, can look past the shortcomings & will see again\\, but not near the 2nd best in the series as some are saying. Somewhere in the middle.","true":true}
