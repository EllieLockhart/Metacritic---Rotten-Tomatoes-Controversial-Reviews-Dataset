Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars film ever made. Seen it 3 times already. Hope fans who can seem to let go of the old trilogies wake up and realize they are trying to help Star Wars transcend into new generations. ","true":true}
