Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally went to see this in theaters\\, and overall my gut feeling is positive. I understand how people are getting really negative vibes from this movie because of how different the style was from the original films. It had more of a rogue one feel (which I automatically like\\, this is star WARS) than the previous episode\\, an episode I didn't really much care for. Han died plus it was basically a direct remake of new hope\\, but Disney put the epic in star WARS with this one and did a pretty good job with passing on the Jedi torch so to speak. What blew me away\\, mostly was the fact a star wars movie had so much to say. The thematic undertones of this movie were amazing. It was about humanity\\, life\\, death\\, darkness\\, and balance (a connection between everyone\\, how everyone matters. There was also the background theme that everything may not always be as it appear\\, as the trailer would have told you. No one is truly good or evil\\, light or dark\\, but somewhere in between and even a \\\"siths\\\" motives may not be what they seem. Just amazing a star wars film could say all that\\, and more spurring lengthy conversations in only 2.5 hours and somehow make sense. To me this was probably on par with empire in it's own way.\\n\\nSpoilers: \\nGood:\\nBeyond non-spoilers\\, I really liked how the saga of Luke came to an end; the throwbacks to real life mythical legends. Yoda was also a nice touch. Ren's\\, and reys story arc had a good continuation\\, same as any true sith\\, the master must be killed. There was one point I honestly thought\\, it is actually over for the rebels. Rey had a valid reason to turn to the other side (not necessarily the dark side either) and help her friend\\, Ren)\\, and I actually thought she was going to turn. Watching the first movies I never thought Luke was going to turn but here I did. The relationship between Ren and Rey was done so well\\, amazing actually.\\n\\nThe explanation of force was so well done by the grey jedi Luke. It's what keeps everything in balance. Light and darkness. We all have both and cannot disregard either. Also darkness or light are not synonyms to evil or good.\\nBad:\\nCouple things I didn't care for. It was too long only because it felt like they tried to put too many things into this movie. There was Rey's training\\, which because of how compacted it was felt very rushed\\, plus the main rebel fleet story-line\\, plus another side quest\\, all which had to take place over the course of 2.5 hours. \\nAlso\\, the similarities to the empire strikes back were more than subtle. It had it's own uniqueness\\, imo\\, so it didn't take too much away though. Anyways...\\n\\nPlotholes:\\n1. The hyperspace crash sequence. How has this never before been used as a valid tactic before now? Unmanned tactical light-speed missiles. You would think...\\n2. Also the smaller craft being about to jump in and out of hyperspace so easily. This is explainable though as it makes sense larger craft cannot make such precise light-speed jumps without large risk so wasn't a big deal to me.\\n\\nWe also still didn't learn anything about Rey's ancestry\\, or maybe there is nothing to learn. I don't know. Something for other's to speculate about. \\n\\n9\/10 for me.","true":true}
