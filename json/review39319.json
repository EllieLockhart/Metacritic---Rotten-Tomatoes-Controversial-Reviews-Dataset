Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a masterpiece! The only way star wars can carry on with new content is with new shocking stories... People are too stuck in their bubble to notice a fantastic Star Wars film when they see it. There are flaws but Empire had flaws too. Disney knew they needed to make original content but there needed to be a switch up in order for ORIGINAL stories to be told and that is exactly what happens in 'The Last Jedi'. It's a funny\\, shocking\\, emotional\\, action packed journey that leads the way to what I can only see as an explosive Episode 9.  Kyle Ren and Luke Skywalker are the stand out performers. I can't wait to see this again!","true":true}
