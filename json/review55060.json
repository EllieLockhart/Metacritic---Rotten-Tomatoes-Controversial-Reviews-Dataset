Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never once left a review for a movie.  This however is a staple of my childhood.  X-wing battles\\, lightsabre duels\\, and the mysticism of the force have given way to drawn out(unnecessary) pep talks during battles\\, cringe-worthy jokes\\, and an utter disrespect for the 8 movies that came before(Rogue One included).  All of the aforementioned movies had winning formula's\\, dictated respect for the past\\, and allowed audiences to see a slowly changing story with brilliant new characters(Rey\\, Finn\\, Kylo Ren\\,Poe) as the old characters were being put to rest respectfully(Han Solo).  This movie\\, The Last Jedi\\, burns the past then pisses on the ashes of the original characters(Lando through inclusion of originals\\, Leia\\, Luke\\, Chewie).  Isaac Newton once said \\\"If I have seen further than others\\, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\\\" This movies has torn down the giants and allowed none of the wonderful new characters a foundation to stand on.  Hopefully my review can enact some \\\"resistance\\\" to Rian Johnson's story-telling.","true":true}
