Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"1\/2 star\\\" reviews\\, and \\\"Not interested reviews\\\" Do not get added to the totals\\n\\nI came back to adjust my review\\, and upgrade to 1 star.\\n\\nThis is my original review.\\n------------------------\\n\\nWhere to start..?\\n\\nThis movie is bad in so many ways it is hard to believe. Anyone telling you to go see this and tells you it is a good movie has clearly no idea on what is a good movie.\\n\\nSetting aside that it is ... at least in a name\\, a star wars movie. The story is horrid\\, it is all over the place\\, but with no direction and for no reason. Most of the many sub plots do not make sense\\, and leave the viewer saying \\\" WTF was that ? \\\"\\n\\nRyan J and Kathleen K are in some sort of spin control now saying that the vast majority  of people have missed the message of the movie.\\n\\nHere is a hint\\, if you have to take to social meadia to try to explain to everyone what your story \/ message is you have failed as a story teller.\\n\\nAnd what was the message by the way?  Lukes story ?  I see the message as \\n\\n \\\" If you fail\\, or make a mistake run away and hide\\, forget everyone you know\\, abandon everyting and go live alone till you die. \\\"  \\n\\nIs this the message I missed ? \\n\\nOr the Rey story ? I see the message as \\n\\n\\\" You do not need training\\, education or expierence everything should be easy and you should not have to work for it. \\\"\\n\\nWe need more people thinking they are entitled to start at the top...just because they want to ? \\n\\nOther people have listed the million and 1 reasons why this movie is bad\\, and no amount of false 5 star reviews of \\\" Best movie ever \\\" is going to change that.\\n\\nI have seen some bad movies in my day\\, but never have I said to myself that I wish I had not seen a movie. But the last jedi\\, I wish I had never gone to see it.  And seeing it\\, it  has ruined me for wanting to see anything else with the name star wars in it.  And I saw \\\"A new hope\\\" at age 12\\, in 1977.  This is the end for me for the star wars movies\\, I feel like I lost a close friend.  I did not like The Force Awakens\\, but I did not hate it\\, but\\, this train wreck I hate\\, saw it once\\, and never again. I am done.","true":true}
