Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything JJ Abrams set up in 7 was thrown out of the window in this film. I have no clue where JJ can go with the story in 9. The visual effects and fan loyalty is what has it barely holding over 50% for the fan score","true":true}
