Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie. But too much jokes\\, too much cultural and ethnic diversity\\, too much teddy bear\\, most characters were not faithful to their true essence. Disney kind of did a good movie\\, way better than the force awakens\\, but ruined in some aspects that don't make it a true star wars movie. Better luck next time","true":true}
