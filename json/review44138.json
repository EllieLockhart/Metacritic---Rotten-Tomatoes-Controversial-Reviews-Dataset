Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest it was not a terrible movie. It was in my opinion the worst of all the Star Wars movies. I'll do my best to avoid spoilers but simply put\\, the plot has zero depth to it. JJ did an incredible job building up hype for this movie. He did an incredible job leaving the audience with questions: Who are Rey's parents\\, who is Snoke\\, what has become of Luke. This film does answer all our questions. It does it in such simple form and zero imagination this must have been the easiest payday a Hollywood writer has ever achieved.  It makes the film rely on its special effects and action sequences which really... are nothing we have not seen before. If you enjoy drinking a sip of some Star Wars look aid the movie is enjoyable. But the movie is far from epic. No where close which is disappointing when it had so much build up.","true":true}
