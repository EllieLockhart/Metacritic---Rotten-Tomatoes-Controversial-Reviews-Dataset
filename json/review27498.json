Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall great fun and enjoyable to watch\\, albeit quite sad.   The changing of the old guard to the new is never going to be fully enjoyable\\, watching heroes grow old and die is never fun\\, and is a problem most reboots face.   I really disliked the way parts of the plot were irrelevant to the broader storyline\\, there was some element of pointlessness to it.   But the way the force was explored and the emotional direction of the movie were really well done.  The balance between good and evil and light and dark were covered well.  Looking forward to seeing how the next movie wraps up some of the storylines.","true":true}
