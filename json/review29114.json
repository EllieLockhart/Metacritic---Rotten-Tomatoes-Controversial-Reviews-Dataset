Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really should have been a better movie for a Star Wars picture.  Had some good spots\\, but really got tired of the Disney silliness.  Great performances from Adam Driver and others.  \\nKelly Marie Tran has about as much talent as a rank amateur.","true":true}
