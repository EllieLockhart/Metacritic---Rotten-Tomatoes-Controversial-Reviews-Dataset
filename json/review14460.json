Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated almost everything about this movie. The only scene I actually enjoyed was Rey and Kylo fighting off the Imperial Guards.....but Leia Poppins? SpaceCow milk? \\\"I want to punch a hole in this city\\\"? General Hux-an 8 year old pretending to be a general.... Jedi can force-project themselves and survive in space now? Gee\\, seems like that woulda been useful in the previous 8 films. Not to mention turning Luke into a cowardly fool that didn't want to be bothered and left alone but left a frikkin map to find him??? Oh\\, and the same Luke that never gave up on his father despite the millions of people he potentially murdered\\, but at the first sign of his own nephew becoming \\\"difficult\\\" contemplated murdering his ass in his sleep??? \\n\\n Not only did I hate this movie\\, but it very well may have killed the entire franchise for me.....","true":true}
