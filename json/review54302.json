Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love him or hate him\\, Ben Shapiro\u2019s take on this film is perfect. It\u2019s fun like an avengers and just as silly and nonsensical. Star Wars seriously needs a new hope. TFA and TLJ fall so hard on their face. Only semi- interesting character left: Kylo Ren... the fan in many (most?) of us is dying...","true":true}
