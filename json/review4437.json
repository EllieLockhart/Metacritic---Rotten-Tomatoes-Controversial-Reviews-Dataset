Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Certainly not bad\\, but there are dumb parts. The comedic moments are blatant and feel almost separate from the rest of the movie\\, the villain is a joke and the training is non-existent. The sub-plots feels really tacked on and the actress playing Rose is sub-par.","true":true}
