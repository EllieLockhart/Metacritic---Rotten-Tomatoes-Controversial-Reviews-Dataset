Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will THE LAST JEDI please every Star Wars fan? Since THE FORCE AWAKENS\\, we all know that that's impossible. Nonetheless it is safe to say\\, that this movie will divide audiences even more. Rian Johnson took many risks and made many choices\\, making this the kind of Star Wars movie like you've never seen it before. For me\\, 95% of what they did work beautifully\\, and the few real issues I had with the movie were outshined by all the excitement of some scenes and the gut-wrenching emotions provoked by others.\\nFrom a purely technical standpoint\\, this might very well be the best Star Wars movie to date. Never before did we get such well-written dialogue\\, incredibly interesting and innovative directing and most importantly just wonderful acting. Even the most diehard defenders of the OT should admit\\, that Mark Hamill has never been better as Luke and all the new actors and actresses do an incredible job portraying their characters. Also\\, the camerawork is outstanding. I\\, for my part\\, can't understand\\, how a movie this competently made can be considered bad by critics. By an average audience member who doesn't give a shit about those things: ok\\, but not by someone who analyses movies for a living. \\nJohnson took many chances in regards to story and some of them will not work for some people\\, others won't work for other people\\, but overall\\, this movie has so much to offer that I feel bad for anyone who could not enjoy it.","true":true}
