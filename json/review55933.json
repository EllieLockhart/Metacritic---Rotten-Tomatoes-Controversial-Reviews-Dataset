Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is more talented than this. By far the worst Star Wars movie\\, and Phantom is pretty bad. Head-scratching\\, non-sensical scenes. I have to assume things were meddled with; too many cooks in the kitchen\\, which is probably why Ep. 7-9 are all pretty bad\\, esp. episode 9. There's no way people signed on with a script that matched this final product - a ton of stuff was changed. I think a movie about how badly these three films have been bungled would be more interesting than these three films have been!\\n\\nSW may not be as badly managed at Disney as DC has been at Warner Brothers\\, but it would benefit from being torn down and rebuilt with new people. Promising titles have been ruined by executive meddling and a general mess\\, tarnishing a great brand. Very disappointing. Let Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni run things\\, quick\\, before the executives meddle with The Mandalorian and ruin it\\, too!","true":true}
