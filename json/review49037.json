Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie. As a die hard fan\\, I was so excited for this. The editing was sloppy and the plot lines were stupid. Snoke was a waste of time\\, Finn and Rose's plot line was a waste of time\\, and they completely wasted Luke. I am so incredibly disappointed with this film. The Force Awakens was much better than this\\, and that's saying something.","true":true}
