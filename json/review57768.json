Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very satisfying. Love the call backs to the original Star Wars but the new characters are equally as compelling. Happy to see Luke is as whiny as ever. The third act is as good as it gets at the movies today. To all the naysayers\\, stop whining and get a life.","true":true}
