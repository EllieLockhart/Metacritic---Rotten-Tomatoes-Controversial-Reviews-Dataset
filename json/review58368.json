Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After 30 plus years of waiting to see Luke in action\\, we get.....THIS?!   Sad.  It's not that it tries to be \\\"different\\,\\\" it's that it is different in a terribly written way.   Middle finger to all of the setup done in TFA.   This whole franchise is about family interconnection and that's been thrown down the toilet.   If you want to do that for the next trilogy\\, fine\\, but the legends are going out like chumps.  Sad.","true":true}
