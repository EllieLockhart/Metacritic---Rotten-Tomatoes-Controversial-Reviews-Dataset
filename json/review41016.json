Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie fails as a star wars movie or even as a goof movie.\\nToo many plotholes. Iconic characters ruined. This is not my star wars! Avoid at all costs.","true":true}
