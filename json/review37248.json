Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The penultimate movie of the long standing Skywalker saga delivers. A visually stunning film that bridges the gap between the epic Force Awakens and the inevitable ending of the Skywalker saga with Episode 9. Showcasing how conflicted each character is by not only their surroundings and the ongoing war but also with inner demons and uncertainty. The return of Luke Skywalker showcases a very different version of the character then we are expecting or even used to. Watching Mark Hamill portray a man who is disillusioned with his teachings and his religion was a little jarring but allowed for the ending and for Rey's emergence to mean more. This was a roller coaster ride of emotion and action\\, culminating in a fantastic pair of lightsaber battles (the fight in Snoak's chambers & Kylo Ren vs Luke Skywalker ghost). Definite recommend for any Star Wars enthusiast and even for casual fans.","true":true}
