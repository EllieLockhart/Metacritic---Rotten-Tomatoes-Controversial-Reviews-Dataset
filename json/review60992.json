On the graphics side of things\\, it is amazing. I have found myself just spending some time around the post-apocalyptic maps exploring and just stopping to look at the scenery. The motion capture of the characters is gorgeous\\, The interfaces and fighting mechanics are satisfying and solid\\, but the NPCs can be a little off with how they react to melee weapons. Sadly this is where my review goes askew... The voice acting was rather bland\\, it felt laboured and not realistic enough. I am deeply disappointed in the shallow story of this title vs the previous. it's watered down\\, lacklustre and so far in my journey has left me annoyed.  It's an R18+ rated title here in Australia. There are some brutal and confronting scenes in this game which invoked some pretty challenging feelings. While this is understandable from the game creators as an artistic work\\, it doesn't really have the intended effect and makes me feel like I'm being schooled in some sort of morality lesson perhaps? There are some outstanding plot holes\\, the dead story ends\\, and some plot points where you feel it may be important\\, but lead to nothing. I would have hoped that after the years of waiting\\, a decent progressive story would be the key binding element from the two titles\\, but alas this did not pan out.\r\rIf your as big a fan of the original as I am\\, you may find it difficult to appreciate this latest instalment.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
