Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing about The Last Jedi was serious. It's like an alien\\, who knows basically what starwars is but has never seen a movie\\, went off and made a starwars movie. The plot was weak\\, the humor was tasteless\\, porgs we're freaking annoying\\, Been Solo is not the villain we are looking for\\, and I could have gotten past the shoddy choreography\\, had the movie not been riddled with other problems.","true":true}
