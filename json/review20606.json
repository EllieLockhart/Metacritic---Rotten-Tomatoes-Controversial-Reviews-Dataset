Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've now seen this movie twice\\, and in different company\\, and each viewing produced the same reaction.... rubbish.  Rian took all the build-up from the last movie and thought it would be edgy to take a proverbial sword to it.\\, he simply disregards it.   The story is lazily written\\, clunky and at times\\,  just boring.   The characters are one dimensional mostly\\, and the legacy figures are treated with a disdain that is really unworthy of what they have been built up as for 40 years.  Leia becomes Mary Poppins\\, Chewie is Rey's pet\\, Admiral Ackbar barely gets a screen time before he is roasted...and Luke becomes a cranky old coward.  Way to take a dump on the legacy characters.  I had high hopes for this movie\\, I enjoyed Looper\\, and the trailers showed a lot of promise.  The movie itself\\, as Lucas observed\\, is beautifully made\\, but a lazy\\, rubbish  bunch of storylines that ultimately go nowhere.  Passable\\, but in the order is Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
