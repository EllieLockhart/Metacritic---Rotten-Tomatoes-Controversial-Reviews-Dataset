Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would give this zero stars if I could. Convoluted plot. Dragged on forever. Too many storylines at once. Just altogether a terrible movie. What a pity. Should've stopped at the original three movies. The three prequel movies were okay enough. The recent prequel was pretty good\\, but this was just terrible.","true":true}
