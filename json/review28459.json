Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty disappointing. As a Star Wars fan my expectations were high and the big (mysteries) that Disney has been trying to set up weren\u2019t that great. It\u2019s honestly sad to say that I enjoyed Revenge of The Sith more than this film. ","true":true}
