Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie crushed me as a long time fan.  What we wanted:  a three movie story featuring our favorites characters (Luke\\, Han\\, Leia) coming back after many years\\, kicking ass together\\, then passing the torch on to the next generation in the third film.  What we got:  wanton killing of beloved characters in anticlimactic ways to further the stories for new characters that we are not nearly as emotionally invested in.  I have no desire to even see the next film\\, that is how badly this was bungled.","true":true}
