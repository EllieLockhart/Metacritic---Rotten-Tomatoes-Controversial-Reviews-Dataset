Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"When playing I had high hopes this game would be amazing. However\\, I was proven wrong. I'll first state this\\, the graphics were a 10\/10 and the gameplay was an 8\/10\\, however the story ruined the game. After Joel died I gave the game the benefit of the doubt. Yes\\, everyone including me was very upset about the death of Joel. However it could've been done right\\, but it was porly executed. I enjoyed the story though until the last half of the game. When I realized I had to play 10+ hours as the most unlikable character ever\\, Abby. I almost quit playing. I kept if they am playing though to see if Ellie gets revenge. Only to find out the ending gave Abby the happy ending and left Ellie alone and her life meaningless. I give the story a 3\/10. I will never pick up this game again and now in my mind the only thing cannon about the last of us part II is the last of us' secret epilogue that they put in at the beginning of this game. I am not going to play the last of us part III if they make one either because clearly they are setting it up to star Abby. Very disappointed. Not worth $60.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
