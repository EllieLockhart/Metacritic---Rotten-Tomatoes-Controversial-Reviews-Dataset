Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like everyone else\\, my feelings about The Last Jedi are complicated. This movie took chances and some of those chances landed and some didn't. But this is also a movie about making mistakes and recovering from those mistakes. For me\\, the parts that didn't land were forgivable\\, and the good parts took my breath away. I've seen it twice now and enjoyed it much more the second time. It's not a perfect movie\\, by any stretch of the imagination\\, but it's definitely worth seeing.","true":true}
