Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To call this movie a flaming dumpster fire would be unfair to dumpsters and fires.\\n\\nWhen Vice Admiral Holdo was introduced (AKA Purpley McPurple Hair)\\, it felt like she was a character from another movie who invaded the scene like the ending to a Mel Brooks' movie.\\n\\nHalf the movie happened for no reason. The other half was stupid.\\n\\nDid anyone involved with this movie have an understanding of character development? Finn learns not to be brave. Poe learns not to ask questions about stupid plans. Rey learns nothing an gets amazinger.\\n\\nAlso\\, they should have put Luke Skywalker in this movie. He wasn't in one single scene.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens was OK and had some potential. The Last Jedi was a disaster.\\n\\nF -","true":true}
