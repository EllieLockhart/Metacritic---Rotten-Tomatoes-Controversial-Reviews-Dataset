Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the worst movie I have seen. There is no emotional connection between audiance and characters if they killed them all off I dont think I would of shed a tear. The film is lacking a good story\\, and the script seems to have been taken straight from a 5 year old on the playground. This movie was a waste of time and money!","true":true}
