Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WOW! This was worse than I thought!  I thought my friends were exaggerating but Last Jedi actually went even lower than my already rock bottom expectations!\\n\\nAnd there's no way the audience score is as high as 49%\\nJust look through the reviews here. Its impossible.\\n\\nThink I'll stick to Metacritic for an HONEST score!","true":true}
