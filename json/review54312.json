Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie.  It actually made me angry and upset. I won't repeat what thousands of others have already covered but I simply can't fathom why they went down this road? For the life of me I can't see any upside to this? Why would Disney try to drive off Star War's most loyal fans? Contrary to the tripe in the movie you don't need to kill the past to move forward.  They could have told the next Star Wars saga in a thousand different ways that would have pleased everyone (except maybe critics) but no - they elected to spit in the face of the people who love this franchise.   Disney\\, you just killed your golden goose but you don't know it. You should have followed that old bit of advice that says\\, don't fix what's not broken.","true":true}
