Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"!Possible Spoilers!\\n\\nDespite being awe inducing and having me engulfed for most of the runtime of the film\\, TLJ is not without issues. I feel that there were several missed opportunities of the movie to capitalize on some truly interesting possibilities. \\n\\nFirst\\, I'd like to say that Finn and Rose's C-Plot really falls flat in some instances. Especially since their efforts ultimately are wasted\\, and not much character development is gained from their experiences aside from Finn learning that the Resistance is about fighting to save what you love as opposed to destroy something you hate. Poe's B-Plot arc is a lot more intriguing as you see the character struggle with his impulsiveness and learn to be more than just \\\"the best pilot in the resistance.\\\" That being said\\, communication could have saved him and everyone else a lot of grief. \\n\\nThe biggest missed opportunity really comes from my expectations for a more thoughtful film. When Luke says \\\"it is time for the Jedi to end\\,\\\" I truly believed that he recognized that the Jedi Order was a religious extremist group that functioned as a government entity was the reason that the Galactic Empire rose in the first place. I thought it meant that Luke saw the truth of the Force\\, and the need for balance\\, and that the fight of good and evil is a lot more nuanced than just black and white\\, and included a lot more gray. \\n\\nWhen the movie ends without so much as considering that as a possibility\\, I felt disappointed. But at the end of the day\\, I don't know what I should have expected from a Star Wars movie. The franchise in general has never really succeeded with deeper intricacies and philosophies\\, and is most importantly a thrilling space adventure and about the fight between Jedi and Sith. For these reasons\\, this movie lives up to everything you should actually expect from a Star Wars movie\\, and certainly can maintain your focus and attention with many a jaw-dropping moment throughout. \\n\\nI loved it\\, and hope that it leads to a truly exceptional finale. And honestly\\, I hope that the rest of the Skywalker family finds themselves resting in peace by the end of it.","true":true}
