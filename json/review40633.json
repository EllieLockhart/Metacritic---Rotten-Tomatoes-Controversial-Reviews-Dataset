Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst SW movie ever made. All the prequels that has been so criticized are better films than this one. The story is awful\\, badly written. All the interesting story elements from The Force Awakens are destroyed in this movie. As a fan of the series you end up feeling NOTHING for all the characters. Luke Skywalker returns after 30 years\\, and it ends up being a complete disaster.\\n\\nHow could Lucasfilm and Disney approve to release this movie? \\nFeels like a bad dream\\, but no\\, this is real. :'(","true":true}
