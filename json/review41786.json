Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is really an insult to all SW fans all over the world (I come from Europe). To summarise the movie:\\n\\nTake the Iron cage of PC\\, copy some ideas from Episodes V and VI\\, write a plot that does not go anywhere and is so full of holes and inconsistencies that a mid-school student could write a better one\\, put inside this \\\"storyline\\\" questionable politicized (mostly SJW) content in form of bad characters and story choices\\, introduce stupid jokes that make no sense in the scenes\\, forget basic logic\\, physics and overall how humans behave\\, add some Disney \\\"lets sell toys and make money\\\" -magic (CGI)\\, and call this mess Star Wars - voila you have The Last Jedi\\n\\nIt is just a bad movie by itself\\, and does not fulfil any criteria of being SW film (only breaks the lore and decades of saga building). Moreover\\, the film is way too politicized. Especially the really obvious identity politics and anti-male agenda (Holdo\\, Mary Sues\\, weak males\\, females=good\\, leaders\\, rational\\, independent vs males=bad\\, childish\\, emotional\\, anti-heroes) makes the choices in storytelling insane\\, and might backlash for actual strive for equality (btw. I come from one of the most gender equal countries in the world and I support equality). Star Wars movies have always had strong female characters that feel real and which people can relate to (e.g. Leia\\, Mara Jade\\, even Padme\\, Mon Montha)\\, TFA and TLJ just have basically unrealistic and uninteresting Mary Sues. Most of the women I know do not want to be patronised like this.\\n\\nOnly thing this movie left me feel other than disappointment was a wonder how can this bad of a movie ever be made and released with such resources Disney has and already established SW saga with history and universe where to place the story. Really\\, James Franco should make a new film after the Disaster Artist about making of the Last Jedi\\, title would be something like \\\"The Castration of Luke - The Idiots Behind TLJ\\\".","true":true}
