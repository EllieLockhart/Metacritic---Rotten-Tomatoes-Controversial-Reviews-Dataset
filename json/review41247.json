Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolute drivel. It\u2019s almost as if someone sat down and said \u201chmmm\\, how can I ruin everything great and iconic about Star Wars\u201d and Disney was like \u201cfuck yeah\\, make that movie.\u201d This is an absolute piece of SHIT - excessively cheesy (ghost of jar-jar came back to write this bs)\\, completely neutered (built up to so many moments that could have been great but didn\u2019t do anything)\\, and it recycled so many moments. Save your money\\, don\u2019t go see this drivel. ","true":true}
