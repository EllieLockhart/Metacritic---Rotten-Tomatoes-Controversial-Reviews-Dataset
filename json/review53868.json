Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, rating this movie slightly higher than I would have in an attempt to fight back at the outrage some of the fans are having. Are there some errors in this movie? Yes. There are some errors in many great sci-fi movies. How does Leonardo Diceaprio get out of that super deep level in inception? How does the end of Interstellar even work? The point is\\, when watching sci-fi we have to accept that some things just happen.\\n\\nThat being said\\, this movie has some awesome qualities. One\\, it broke soooo many traditional movie tropes. Moreover\\, it really went in different directions of everyone's \\\"theories\\\" about what was going to happen (the reason I think so many people are butt hurt about it)\\, which I found really refreshing. Finally\\, and this is nearly objective\\, is was absolutely beautifully shot. The cinematography\\, the acting\\, the action sequences\\, the emotions: that was all real\\, and real good if you ask me.","true":true}
