Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Con todo y el giro de Luke todo lleva un orden muy bien llevado. La m\u00fasica y fotograf\u00eda excelentes\\, unas Tom\u00e1s innecesarias con personajes que pudieran dar m\u00e1s pero a m\u00ed parecer es para dejar abierta tramas para alguna serie o algo as\u00ed. Kylo sigue siendo lo mejor en esta trilog\u00eda.","true":false}
