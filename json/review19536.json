Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's very difficult for me to choose what is the worst - E7 or E8. But it's better for Disney to make cartoons. There is no original idea in the E8 - there are only flashbacks to E4-E6 and a lot of face-palms. This film is just a poor set of parodies of excerpts of original trilogy. And at the last they have broken a good tradition of lightsaber duel :(\\nI'm very sad about this film","true":true}
