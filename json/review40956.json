Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie disappoint's on so many levels\\, pointless characters\\, pointless sub plots\\, pointless villains\\, Leia Poppins\\, and a waste of Luke. I'm pretty sure the dumpster fire that is this movie is the cause of the California wild fires.","true":true}
