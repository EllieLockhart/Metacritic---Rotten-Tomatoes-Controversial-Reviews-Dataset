Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed. I'm tired of Star Wars introducing new charaters and doing absoliuty nothing with them. The Force Awakens was a remake of A New Hope. The Last Jedi has too many similarities to Empire and Return of the Jedi. The other thing that bothered me\\, was the lame jokes (i.e Holding for General Hux) and how over the top General Hux was at being evil. Thought I was watching Dr. Evil in an Austin Powers film.","true":true}
