Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I can say is OMG!!! This SW film was the worst of all of them\\, and yes\\, there has been not so good ones. As a lifetime SW fan\\, I cant believe Rian Johnson just wasted 2.5 hours of mine and the worlds time of basically having us on a string and didnt answer s##t for everything JJ Abrams set up for him! Idiot. Worst director for the job. I have seen force awakens like 8 times\\, but was embarrased to say I seen The Last Jedi even once. Disney...how can you allow one frickn director to ruin a whole franchise??? It seems like Rian Johnson did this on purpose too! I am so disappointed and most of the real SW fans. You disrepected Mark Hamill\/Luke\\, Carrie Fischer\\, RIP\\,  even bad@ss Kylo Rens Character\\, and love between two ugly @ss people with Fin and Rose. Really!? Love and they just met hours prior? Sooo stupid. Disney needs writing classes. I vote that this movie not be even labeled Episode 8! Retract this whole dumb movie.","true":true}
