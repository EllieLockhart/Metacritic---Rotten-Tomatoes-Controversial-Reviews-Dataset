Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the spark died and noh its not the spark of the rebellion its the spark of the starwars universe this movie is but only a mimic of Disney's making of marvel. starwars franchise had became a money making machine","true":true}
