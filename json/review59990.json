But in general terms\\, the plot is contrived\\, the beloved characters do not act In a way consistent with the first game\\, and the new characters are unlikeable despite the game\u2019s best efforts to make you empathise with them (one in particular).  The story does have some good moments (most in the first couple of hours)\\, but after that it becomes clich\u00e9d with a mixed bag of dialog.  The game desperately wants to preach the message \u2018revenge is bad\u2019 but it does so by forcing characters (and often the player) to do inexplicably bad things\\, then scolds you for what the game has either done or forced you to do.  With very little choice for the player\\, why should I take ownership of the message? Just cheap\\, clumsy writing.  In summary\\, the technical achievements of this game are wasted on what just seems like brutality porn with a poor story that has neither respect for It\u2019s predecessor nor its characters.  Shocking for the sake of being shocking and ultimately very disappointing for something I\u2019ve waited seven years for.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
