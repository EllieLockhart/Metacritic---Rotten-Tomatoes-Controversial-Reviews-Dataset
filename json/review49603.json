Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, so terrible.  The most poorly written movie I have ever seen\\, a total departure from who the characters are based on their long history.  Poor character development\\, poor story telling.  This was an action movie\\, so if you have never seen another star wars movie you may like it\\, but if you have any history with the franchise you will walk away shaking your head\\, longing for the days of Lucas.","true":true}
