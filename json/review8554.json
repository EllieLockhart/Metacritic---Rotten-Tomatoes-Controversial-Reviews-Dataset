Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First let me say that I really enjoyed the music\\, visual effects\\, and Mark Hamill's performance was great even though I didn't like what they did with Luke Skywalker. That being said this was a bad \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie. The amount of plot holes and lack of logic like dropping bombs similar to a WWII bomber in space when there's no gravity in space or the subplot with Finn and Rose that was completely unnecessary. This movie was a mess. Completely took everything JJ set up in the Force Awakens and ruined it. I saw this movie twice. I thought that my opinion was wrong the first time I saw it and I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and I even waited 2 months to do my review in order to think and soak in what I saw. My official opinion is that this Star Wars movie is garbage. I created a list of all the things wrong with this movie and there's 33 things wrong with it. 33. Bottom line this is a horrible movie and I expected more. Also says something when the actors in the movie don't like the movie.","true":true}
