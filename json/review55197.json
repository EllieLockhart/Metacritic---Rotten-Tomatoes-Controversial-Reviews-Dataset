{"101487":147716,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would put zero stars if I could\\, but apparently I can not. In short\\, the movie was an ABSOLUTE disappointment. The director was incompetent at best. The music director's music score was no better than a 5 year old who doesn't know how to play an instrument whatsoever. The characters\\, as well as the plot\\, were COMPLETELY garbage! My advice\\, don't waste your money and you time by watching this sorry excuse for a movie.","true":true}
