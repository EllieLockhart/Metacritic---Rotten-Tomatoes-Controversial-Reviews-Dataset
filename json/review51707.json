Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointment to Star Wars Fans\\, the amount of 'twists' and redundancies\\, even character break in this film make you appreciate the Prequels. This shows the capability of Disney when it comes to writing films\\, much so keeping their legacy.","true":true}
