Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact anyone finds anything to like about this movie is astonishing. I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie I not only hated\\, but found insulting. The best way to watch the sequel movies is to start with The Force Awakens and end with The Rise of Skywalker.","true":true}
