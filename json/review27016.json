Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars movies on the list.  I am an original trilogy guy\\, i did like parts of the prequels\\, but this one...maaan...awesome!  Ignore these weird ratings from 1 and 2 star rates\\, they are out of their minds or mad about life\\, not Star Wars\\, I'm certain they posted a review for some other movie by accident.  Go see it and you will see!","true":true}
