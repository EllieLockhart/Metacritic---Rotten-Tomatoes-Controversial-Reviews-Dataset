Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in expecting it to be a little better than the first movie\\, as it should be at a minimum. I was blown away by every aspect of this film. The special effects\\, acting\\, plot\\, action\\, and soundtrack all blow the original completely out of the water. Gone are the cliche's of old Star Wars films. They finally took a modern approach to the franchise and it paid off. With so many crazy twists and turns\\, I never knew what was next in this movie. I wasn't sure who would live and die or what the outcome of certain dire situations would be. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. If you are like me\\, and liked Rogue One better than Episode VII\\, then you will love this movie.","true":true}
