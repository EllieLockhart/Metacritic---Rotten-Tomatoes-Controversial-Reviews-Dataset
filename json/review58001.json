Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I am not the biggest Star Wars fan out there\\, I am old enough to remember the joy and excitement created by the first film. With all the negative audience reviews piling up\\, it just seemed like there was a need for some balance. First\\, let me get this out of the way. If you are attending this movie to see the old characters that you know and love continue their previous arc through the story\\, you will be disappointed. Having said that\\, I think that Mark Hammil delivers his best performance yet by a long shot as a Jedi master. Skywalker's experiences with the dark side have left him withdrawn\\, reluctant and a bit disillusioned. There is far more depth for the character in this story and Hammil makes full use of it. Nearly all of the main characters get some good development. The script and acting may be the best yet in the series. Sure\\, there are the usual plot holes\\, some unnecessary levity and cute characters added mostly for murchandising\\, but this film is better than so many of the audience critics have suggested. My take is that the virtues of The Last Jedi extolled by most of the professional critics outweigh the dissatisfaction expressed by so many of the audience critics on this one.","true":true}
