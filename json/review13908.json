Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a SW fan\\, please not watch this movie...just wait for bluray or dvd...or better yet..dont watch at all \\n\\n\\nNow if you have seen this and have mixed feelings or didnt enjoy it\\, please dont watch it a second time. The only way to tell Lucasfilm\/Disney that fans are not happy--is by not contributing (more) money to watch this. I watched the previous Star Wars films in the cinema multiple times. Definitely more than once in the cinemas. This will be my first Star Wars movie that I will only watch once....\\n\\nStill utterly devastated...","true":true}
