Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Disregard the 0\/10s. If someone personally hated every aspect of the story\\, every word that came out of the character's mouths; it still can't be a 0. People are willing to throw aside the game-play\\, graphics and animation because this is a sequel that gives all who played the first installment very intense emotions. I myself\\, was affected very strongly by the opening of the game. For a few moments\\, it wasn't a game anymore. Fixated on the screen\\, I played the game from start to finish in one sitting. But\\, even though I'm giving the game a strong 10\/10\\, I did experience what those who gave it a 0 did. Watching Joel die was gut wrenching. We all cared about Joel\\, some of us cared more than we thought. This masterpiece doesn't get to be brought down because some of us can't handle our emotions. Would you prefer Ellie kill a barley alive Abby and leave a child to die? Would you prefer we turn Ellie into the monster she was hunting all along? Those who give 0\/10s don't think about it because they can't see past our dead friend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
