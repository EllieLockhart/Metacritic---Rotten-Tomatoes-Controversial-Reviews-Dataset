Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far too cartoonish and far too many characters wasted. The great Star Wars movies developed their characters and plot lines... this just through in as many as it could for the sake of it. Also the originals had iconic villains who could impose genuine fear that they where going too win. Hux\/Ren just seem complete morons. Poe was a bigger villain causing just about as many Rebel deaths as the the first order... why would they keep.someone like that around after his leadership lost so many lifes?! The bit with Leia flying through space was the point I though uhh oh this could be bad!\\n\\nThere was a couple cool moments... the Dreadnought! (Although it was then made too look stupid) and Ren\/Rey fight with the Imperial Guards was awesome...other than that very disappointing.","true":true}
