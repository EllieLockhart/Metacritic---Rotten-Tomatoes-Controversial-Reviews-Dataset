Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If there were ever a movie that gave away how shitty the rating system is on Rotten Tomatoes. It's this one. This movie f***ing blew blue balls and it's so obvious the critics were either paid\\, retarded\\, or blind. I regret paying money and keeping my eyes open during this movie. You thought Jar Jar was bad? LULZ","true":true}
