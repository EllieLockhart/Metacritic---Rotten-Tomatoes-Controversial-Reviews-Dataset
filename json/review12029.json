Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie! Losing another of the original characters was sad but I understand that things have to move on for the next generation. The story moved along well and even though it was 2.5 hours long\\, it did not seem that long.","true":true}
