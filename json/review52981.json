Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die-hard fan of the original and prequel trilogy of Star Wars\\, I'm highly disappointed with Episode VIII... Jarring\\, overly sarcastic\\, post-modernist humor throughout.. Incredibly \\\"preachy\\\" and steeped in SJW narrative that completely takes you out of the experience. What makes it such a shame too is that this movie had so much potential. Not to mention the utter slap in the face to source materiel and established characters. As a character\\, Luke is tossed aside and treated as dog doo.","true":true}
