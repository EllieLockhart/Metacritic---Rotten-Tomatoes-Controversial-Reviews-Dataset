Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rain Johnson takes many risks and brings something different to the Star Wars universe\\, some things work and some do not. The pacing of the movie was minorly affected by the fin story line and I would say that the humour worked for the most part. Overall this was a great movie that took risks that for the most part worked for me.","true":true}
