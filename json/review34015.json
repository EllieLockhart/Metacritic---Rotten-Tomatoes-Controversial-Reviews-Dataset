Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible treatment of Luke Skywalker\\, disappointing usage of Finn's character\\, Rey is essentially a Mary Sue for Rian Johnson to project himself into with no redeeming qualities or significant struggles to warrant how near perfect she is\\, Snoke is wasted before he can be used more effectively in the next film\\, more old characters from the original trilogy are killed off unnecessarily\\, nonsensical plot points concerning Holdo withholding vital strategic information\\, Leia is criminally unused\\, Rose's character gets in the way of the narrative and stops any interesting dynamic that was blooming between Rey and Finn in The Force Awakens\\, Captain Phasma is made into a joke and unused (again)\\, and finally there's too much comedy.\\n\\nOverall a weak entry in this franchise. At least the visuals and the music are good.","true":true}
