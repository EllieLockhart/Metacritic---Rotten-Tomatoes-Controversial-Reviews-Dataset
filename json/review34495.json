Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie. It takes the fans' built-up expectations and plays with them. It challenges the viewer and that's the genius of Rian Johnson. The story is beautiful - every character gets challenged. I can identify with Rey a lot - she has to face the fact that she'll have to build herself up instead of getting an easy way out of her identity crisis. This movie is about the power of the past\\, the value of nostalgia versus taking a step forward. If you're not the kind who only wants pistol fights\\, new merch and old stunts out of Star Wars then you'll enjoy this movie a lot.","true":true}
