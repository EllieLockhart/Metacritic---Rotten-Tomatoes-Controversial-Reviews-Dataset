Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The negativity is coming from the same fans who thought the last film was too nostalgic now this one for taking a new direction. By no means the best Star Wars film but it does not deserve this much backlash\\, I personally enjoyed it especially the character development of Rey and Kylo and their relationship. ","true":true}
