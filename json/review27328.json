{"101487":160928,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the plus side: good performances from Driver and Ridley\\, Hamill finally gets to do some real acting (AND over-acting\\, but\\, hell\\, he's been waiting for like ages to do this...). There were some good-to-grat actions scenes\\, and I liked some of the choices Johnson made\\, trying to subvert expectaions\\, BUT!! Anything aside from the Rey-Ren-Luke storylines felt like filler (and mostly bad filler\\, at that). The Force Awakens set the new trilogy on track to more-or-less replay the original one\\, and this just feels old and tired and completely unnecessary. I will NOT be coming back for the \\\"final\\\" chapter.","true":true}
