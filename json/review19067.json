Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's going be amazing sadly I can't watch it cause my family are not into these type of films I'll get it on dvd","true":true}
