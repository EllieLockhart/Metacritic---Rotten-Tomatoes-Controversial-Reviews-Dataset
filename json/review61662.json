Naughty Dog betrayed everything the main characters of the first game ever stood for with how they handled the story for this game. First lets talk about Joel. He never once behaved in any way in the first game that would lead us to believe he would ever be stupid enough to give his name to complete strangers! especially after the ending of the first game which effectively makes him a wanted man! Then the way they rub his death in your face only to immediately force you to play as his killer. Abby is not a likable or relatable character. Ever vile violent act she commits she gets more and more pleasure from while Ellie is genuinely disgusted with some of the thing's she's forced to do. I don't situationally forced I mean narratively forced. So much of the writing in this games appears to be done deliberately for maximum shock value and nothing else. Joels death was incredibly contrived and obvious in it's intent and none of the stories attempts to make Abby in any way likeable succeeded she feels worse and worse to play as time goes on. Some of the decisions characters make defy all logic and reason and simply serve to further the story at the cost of virtually all players agency. I'm not going to go over the graphics\\, VO work or the music because I knew all of those would be amazing and they where. The gameplay hasn't evolved much in seven years of development which is a shame but I was fine with the gameplay in the first game and I'm fine with it here. The reasons people bought this game was the story and the story is incredibly disappointing in every way. I'm going to erase this game from my memory and happily live with the self imposed lie that TLOU had no sequel. Because not having another game at all would still be better than this.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
