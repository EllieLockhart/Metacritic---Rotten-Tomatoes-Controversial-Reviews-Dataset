Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very different SW movie that I have seen since I was only 9. A lot of changes and many surprises brought by Rian the director\\, but I have to say that he didn't write Luke\\, his life and his ending properly.  As a big Luke and Mark fan\\, I couldnt sleep well after watching on the opening night\\, got sick and headache\\, and I am very depressed and sad.\\nBoth Luke and Mark deserve a better story and better ending\\, at the end seeing Luke looked at the binary sun and faded away quietly is not peaceful\\, is so lonely\\, cold and cruel\\, and the reactions from Leia and Rey didn't justify that this is the right ending of Luke's life.  Maybe Mark will play as force ghost Luke\\, but that's not the point\\,  his worries\\, stress\\, unhappy etc always follows him to eternal....\\nLuke was a boy looking in the horizon for adventures\\, excitement\\, he got all these plus something more\\, family that he never got the chance to enjoy\\, a father that was the biggest villian in the galaxy next to Palpatine\\, a brief moment with a long lost sister\\, no family of his own\\, failure as a teacher\\, all the sorrow and regrets to live as an exile hermit on an island... Luke's life was definitely a hard life\\, and same as Mark\\, just when he got the level of stardom then the SW role ended\\, he had to take up other roles like voice acting and other media.\\nLuke and Mark deserves better story and better chance to continue in this saga....","true":true}
