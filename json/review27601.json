Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overdone CGI\\, corny cliche dialogue and scenes\\, over the top comic relief\\, eye-rolling rescues\\, meaningless side missions\\, no overarching story. Very disappointed especially after a well-done film two years ago. Leia's scene should be removed\\, casino scene completely removed\\, Poe and Hux dialogue in beginning removed\\, BB-8 AT-ST scene removed\\, and Rose rescue scene of FInn removed.","true":true}
