Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's fun to look at\\, but in terms of being a Star Wars film\\, it sucks. If this was a movie that existed in a vacuum with no established lore\\, I imagine it would be very good. However\\, it's supposed to be a sequel in an established universe\\, which means it shouldn't just break any and all laws of the universe and lore as it pleases! Not much in this movie makes sense from a lore point of view\\, not to mention the character of Rey is just a horrible one.","true":true}
