Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The half star is for the amazing visuals and wonderful backgrounds. The only good thing about that movie. The story is bad\\, the acting is bad (except of BB-8). And they end up AGAIN on a WHITE planet fighting AT-ATs wit SPEEDERS!!!!! They shoot in a ballistic arch in space and why do Spaceships without fuel make a full stop? Why does the Empire only shot with one cannon on the transporter? Why to the no just send ONE of the Star Destroyer ahead?","true":true}
