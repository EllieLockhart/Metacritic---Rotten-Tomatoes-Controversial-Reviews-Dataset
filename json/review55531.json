Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never has a movie provided such disappointment.  It fails miserably as entertainment\\, let alone a Star Wars movie.  I am no fanboy\\, but what critic in their right mind could give this a thumbs up?  All of the character assassinations and plot holes have been covered. Why are the characters all so childish?  Poe is an absolute jerk and the Laura Dern admiral character with her 'secret' plan is stupid.  The fate of the Rebellion rests with an OJ esque space chase....really.....really....good grief.  Lets not forget\\, never\\, never\\, has anyone staged a mutiny in the all for one\\, good for the universe rebellion\\, except the childish Poe. What about Leia's 'use my code' and our friends will show up.....nobody comes\\, so apparently the Rebellion is reduced to a bunch of babies taking off on the Falcon...seriously.  Have to mention the arms dealers betting their spoils at a lavish casino was likely the most idiotic premise (aside from space Leia) in the whole movie. The First Order would not buy arms for gods sake!!!!  Is the First Order supposed to be some sort of business enterprise.  Who trained Snoke or who was he for that matter?  Seems Luke should have know who he was?  Reys parents have no connection to anything?  Kylo Rens mask is ridiculous as stated by Snoke?  What an awful movie.","true":true}
