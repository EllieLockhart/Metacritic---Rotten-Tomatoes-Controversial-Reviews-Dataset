Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars movie to date. Terrible writing\\, plot\\, script\\, characterisation and tedious production design. A perfect example of Disney greed and an attempt to grab money with little to no effort of earning it by creating a decent story and quality final product.\\nDisney\/Lucasfilm draughted in the old classic actors\/ characters and unceremoniously and disrespectfully killed them off once they knew their box office draw had done its job. Not only a terrible Star Wars movie\\, but a bad sci-fi\/fantasy movie in its own right. It has no place being part of the series\\, and by its existence alone ruins the previous movie The Force Awakens. The only sequels to the original trilogy are the books and comics that were released over the last 30 years\\, written by certifiably talented minds and creative talents. Those same books and comics utterly shame everything in The Last Jedi\\, and show it up for the amateurish\\, lazy\\, social-political agenda-driven mess that it is. If you enjoy this film\\, you have a) low standards\\, and b) no idea of what makes a good movie\\, let alone what makes a good Star Wars movie. The franchise is dead thanks to this garbage. Well done Disney & Lucasfilm. I hope you're happy with the train-wreck you've created. Because those who truly love the franchise\\, and have supported it since A New Hope\\, and all through it's fallow years\\, most certainly aren't!","true":true}
