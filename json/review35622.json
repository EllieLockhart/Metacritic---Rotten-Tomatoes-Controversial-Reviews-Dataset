Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a marked improvement over the unoriginal The Force Awakens and fixes some of my biggest complaints about the previous film. TLJ  propels the saga into a new direction to keep it fresh which it desperately needed to do. (How many times can you blow up the Death Star?) It also features more thrilling battle scenes both on land and in space in addition to showcasing some great toe-to-toe light saber scenes. I worried in vain about the added comedy I read about in many reviews; the humor successfully complements the film. Through his charm\\, experience\\, and wisdom\\, Mark Hamill's presence really sustains the film and inspired nostalgia on multiple occasions. A majority of the negative reviews are unintelligent and sparse (e.g. \\\"TLJ sucks\\\" and \\\"Disney ruined SW\\\"). Now that I've seen the film myself\\, I can justifiably advise SW fans to dismiss the bad reviews and recommend seeing TLJ. 93% of the film critics (at the time of this review) got it right!","true":true}
