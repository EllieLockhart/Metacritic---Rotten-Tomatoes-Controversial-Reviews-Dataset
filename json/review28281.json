Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor Rose has a terrible story. The casino planet is bad. The pacing frequently feels off. The humor is unlike that in other Star Wars films. Some of the drama feels contrived. It may be hard to suspend disbelief on the motives and actions of some core characters. The new force powers raise as many questions as they answer.\\n\\nA flawed film to be certain\\, but the moments of spectacle and awe make up the gap. It won't be for everyone\\, but if you can make it over the bumps\\, you're in for one hell of a ride.","true":true}
