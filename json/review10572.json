Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals and some awesome scenes. Good acting of Daisy Ridley\\, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill. But there are too many plot holes for a modern movie\\, even for a Sci-Fi-Fantasy mix. And Rian Johnson changed some charactars way too much\\, especially Luke Skywalker. Additionally I didn't like that Johnson dropped most of open threads JJ Abrams handed over to him at the end of Episode 7. Last but not least: Too many bad slapstick gags. I was hoping for a more adult movie like Rogue One.","true":true}
