Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never reviewed here before. Signed up just to do so. \\n\\nWhat can I say that hasn't been said all ready? This movie is beautiful - but boy is it stupid! Tragically stupid.\\n\\nI'll just sum it up like this: JJ Abrams sets up Rian Johnson with the sweetest aliey-oop of all time. Rian's in the air - grabs the ball for the slam dunk! He then lands\\, chucks the ball into the nose bleed seats\\, places his palms at his mouth and makes a fart noise then flips off everything Star Wars was or ever could be.\\n\\nHow this absolute mess of a motion picture got past anyone for production is beyond me.\\n\\nSimply irredeemable.","true":true}
