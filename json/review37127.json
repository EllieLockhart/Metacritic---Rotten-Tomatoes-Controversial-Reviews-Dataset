Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only negative reviews\\, come from purists that are still upset their old stories were removed from the official Star Wars canon. Without spoiling the movie\\, a lot of their complaints can be seen happening in the old stories as well. They just hate for the sake of hating. Ignore ALL negative reviews. It is an excellent film\\, worth of being in the 90 percentile.","true":true}
