Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really a great Star Wars movie though I can understand why some people might not be happy with the direction they took Luke Skywalker.  For me\\, they gave me a believable scenario as to why he would seclude himself and we still got to see one of the absolute most awesome moments in the saga when he \\\"fights\\\" Kylo Ren.  Overall I think it's the best of the Disney Star Wars films\\, though still below any of the Original Trilogy films.  I love Rey\\, loved the battle in the throne room\\, and loved the Porgs.  Thought the Canto Bight scenes were the low mark of the film and probably could have been edited a bit.","true":true}
