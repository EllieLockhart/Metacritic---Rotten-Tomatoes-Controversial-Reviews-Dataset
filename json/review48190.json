Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE i WAS ALMOST CONVINCED I WAS WATCHING A GOOD MOVIE. tHE MORE i THOUGHT ABOUT IT HOWEVER... iT sPITS IN THE FACE OF BELOVED CHARACTERS LEFT AND RIGHT\\, THIS MOVIE IS A BEAUTIFULLY MADE MESS FULL OF PLOT HOLES AND INCONSISTENCIES. tHE POSITIVE REVIEWS DONT REALLY MAKE SENSE AND i SUSPECT MONEY CHANGING HANDS.","true":true}
