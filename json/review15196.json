Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked TFA and everything I liked is gone. Luke is a wining baby\\, Snoke dies\\, Luke dies\\, Leia lives (??) Dohmhal overacts\\, Rose and Finn blegh\\, to much deux ex machinas\\, to many plotholes\\, why the mirrors\\, why the connection between Rey and Kylo\\, Horseracing?","true":true}
