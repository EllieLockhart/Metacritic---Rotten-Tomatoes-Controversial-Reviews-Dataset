Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie.  Glad to see the franchise mix up the style a little bit while splashing in some familiar style as well.  Definitely not the run-of-the-mill Star Wars movie and that is a good thing.  Love the humor and Mark Hamill is amazing.","true":true}
