{"40636":"Negatives: Ok the story is just a bad rollercoaster ride. I don't know why they choose to go down this path for the writing of the game. For the first Hour of the game you play as the new character Abby and she kills Joel. I'm not mad that they killed Joel I'm mad how they did it. Another massive issue In this game are the new characters you are suppose to care about. As Abby when her friends die by Ellie the game expects that you should feel bad for them when you don't. Same thing for Ellie new friends like Jesse I never really game a **** about them through out the game. The Plot for Abby is so dumb. The game tries way to hard to make us feel bad for Abby and it fails at that. The only thing that was slightly interesting about Abby story was Lev backstory. Then after you're with Lev and Lara dies her story feels pointless and that there is no end goal and that I'm doing useless crap with Lev. Ellie flashback with Joel was really nice especially the birthday one. But Even Ellie story feels like the plot and her charter are just weakened and out of touch compared to the first game. By the End of the game the only characters you only really care about are the one from the first game such as Ellie and Tommy. And When Ellie about to kill Abby I guess the writers thought that we will like Abby but we don't. They should've killed Abby it's more realistic. Or better yet written a whole different Story.","TLOU2":null,"2020-08-05":null,"10":null,"The Last of Us 2 represents how games should be made.
