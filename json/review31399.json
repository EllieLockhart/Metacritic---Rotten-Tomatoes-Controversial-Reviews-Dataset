Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some new directions were taken with this film\\, but overall (for me) there was a lot to like.\\n\\nIt moved away from the safe formulate that \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" provided. I felt that the pace of the film was nice. There was new tech\\, new locations and new philosophies. \\n\\nThough I do have some regrets and reservations about some fan favorite characters. \\n\\nI'm interested to see what things the next film holds and I really wish Disney would branch out and start exploring some other areas with some live action shows. We all have lots of questions that need answers. \\n\\n4\/5","true":true}
