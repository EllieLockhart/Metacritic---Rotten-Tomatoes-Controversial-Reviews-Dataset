Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly very entertaining\\, but relied too heavily on \\\"witty\\\" one-liners and critters to capture the attention of the younger crowd as well as those who played with furby as a kid. And don't even get me started on the character Rose. I'm all about women empowerment but there was absolutely no reason Po couldn't have gone with Finn. Not only is the lead character a female (again I don't have a problem with this) but also saturated this film with females taking the lead on something because men are \\\" power-hungry misogynistic pigs.\\\" So in an attempt to eradicate sexism\\, the film just welcomes it as long as a woman is speaking up. Also the love story between Rose and Finn felt rushed and unnecessary. I'm just saying\\, if Finn dies in that scene saving people\\, the movie would have been way better. However the fight and battle scenes were enjoyable and entertaining\\, but not enough to cover the lack of quality character development.","true":true}
