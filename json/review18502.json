Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is rare that a sequel is able to simultaneously abandon the flavour\\, style and soul of the predecessors\\, whilst also ripping them off shamelessly. As such\\, The Last Jedi is at least a rarity. Quite aside from the poor dialogue\\, dull plot and clumsy attempts at humour\\, it was certain individual scenes (and a few individual sub-plots) which really set this apart as the worst Star Wars film. Anyone who has watched the movie will understand these references: 'super-Leia'; 'space-horses'; 'the Phasma scene'. Oh and the shot for shot remake of the attack on Echo base\\, except (and this twist was pointed out bluntly on-screen) the fight takes place on salt rather than snow. Fantastic.","true":true}
