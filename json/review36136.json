Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was an exceptional addition to the Star Wars saga. It was indeed a different take than say JJ's TFA\\, however I'm completely satisfied with that. I perceive TLJ giving a strong message and lesson that most individuals can take to heart. That message is that staying in one place\\, doing the same thing over and over again\\, stagnation\\, it all leads nowhere. Life will always change\\, everything changes\\, and we have to be able to accept that and adapt to it. The story arc continuation is perfect in my taste. It was well worth the few dollars to see on opening night and the few times following.","true":true}
