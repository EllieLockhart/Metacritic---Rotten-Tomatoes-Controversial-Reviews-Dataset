Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked into this movie fresh off re-watching The Force Awakens. \\n\\nI wanted to walk in with an appreciation for the plot\\, for the characters. I wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything\\, any relevant plot points or connections. I've been watching Star Wars since i was a kid\\, i was blown away the first time i saw it on TV\\, Luke Skywalker became my hero. The Jedi\\, with their peace-first philosophy\\, and Luke's defeat of his father not through force\\, but through love\\, through humanizing what good was in him\\, was one of the most amazing moments in cinema i've ever witnessed. There are many masterpieces out there that touch the human soul\\, that show a moment where a character can raise above what they are and become something more- and this was one of those.\\n\\nI didn't go into this film expecting that. I knew\\, like any person\\, that this was a new series\\, under a new director. I wasn't blown away by The Force Awakens\\, but i was surprised to see it brought back that feeling\\, that Star Wars feeling. I'd be lying if i said it didn't get me excited. \\n\\nI went to this film because i genuinely enjoyed The Force Awakens. I wanted to see it progress\\, to see the story unfold. My girlfriend bought me the tickets to the showing the day after opening day as my birthday gift at my request. We had to go to a smaller theater for the showing\\, as it was sold out nearly everywhere.\\n\\nIf you enjoy Star Wars\\, and i mean if you have watched a Star Wars film- and know the names of the characters- Don't watch this. I'm saying this because i care. Don't. Just walk away. Wait for the DVD. Watch it at a friend's house. If you even remotely care about Luke Skywalker- Walk away. Hamill warned the fans for months\\, and we didn't hear him. Just don't do it to yourself. And here- spoiler heavy\\, mind you- is why.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Spoilers)\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe movie opens with that epic shot we ended on in The Force Awakens. Luke\\, standing poised before Rey\\, her outstretched hand holding his lightsaber. Her quest to find Luke fulfilled\\, the map he left so he could be found\\, completed\\, and her epic journey to find him\\, fulfilled. Her face\\, Pleading. His face\\, grave and filled with indefinable emotion. The shot pans back and forth for a second\\, Luke grabs his lightsaber from her open hand\\, and hucks it over his shoulder and off a cliff.\\n\\nNoone in my theatre laughed. Seriously. I'm not kidding. I love Star Wars\\, and i wish i was kidding\\, but i'm not. And honestly\\, it should have been funny. But it wasn't. After two years of waiting\\, two years of building this epic moment. And this is the first scene. \\n\\nIt progresses bewilderingly into Luke not only saying he did not want to be found- (Why did he then leave a trail and explicit instructions to find him?) into him refusing to train Rey. What we\\, as an audience\\, are meant to swallow\\, is that Luke not only left a trail ONLY a force user could follow- he also DID NOT WANT THAT TRAIL FOLLOWED.\\n\\nIt cuts to a scene with Finn\\, waking up in a bacta suit. This is played for laughs\\, him walking around leaking fluid everywhere. But noone laughed. Again\\, i really wish i was joking or lying. I wanted to laugh. But something just wasn't funny about it.\\n\\nThe film progresses to Poe- (The X-Wing fighter from TFA) Lining up with a single X-Wing vs several Imperial Star Destroyers. He attacks the Star Destroyer with no backup- somehow destroying every single turret on it- without them deploying any fighters- and none of the available other star destroyers providing any backup. It's pure nonsense as a tiny ship incapable of the firepower to even damage the enemy ships bewilderingly does so- and pulls it off. Whereas in the OT it took entire squadrons of X wings to destroy just the turrets- All of a sudden due to plot power\\, one X wing can take down a Destroyer. (And he's facing several)\\n\\nI gave up hope right here. I could already tell. From the stale lines pulled straight from a cheesy Sci-Fi channel original\\, to the bs space battle\\, and then right back to Rey training with Luke. Or should i say\\, not training with Luke. Watching Luke Milk an alien's massive crotch nipples while the alien moans suggestively and looks at Rey. Meanwhile\\, a space battle unfolds with the rebels where they drop bombs from a B-Wing in full gravity (In space\\, where there is no gravity)\\, and from nowhere\\, at the last second\\, the Empire pulls a ship out that can predict hyperspace jumps.\\n\\nIt only gets worse. \\n\\nThe plot from here for the rebels consists of them running from the imperial battleships because they are outnumbered (But yet a single X Wing can take on three of them\\, and they have flight decks full of X-Wings) when they discover they are running out of gas. \\n\\nLet me just let that sink in. The Rebel ships are ahead\\, and stay ahead\\, because they are faster. The Empire states the rebels are just out of range of the cannons\\, but soon they will run out of fuel. Noone who made this movie understands how space works.\\n\\nJust to tutor you- In space\\, there is no gravity\\, and no air. No gravity and no air means very little resistance. That means\\, once you have achieved maximum velocity (like with a engine) you remain at that speed nearly indefinitely. That means\\, you don't need to use gas once you're at top speed. And at their top speed\\, they were faster than the Empire. Get the problem?\\n\\nThey don't even need the fuel to stay ahead. And this is only one of the huge problems created by the lack of basic knowledge this film displays.\\n\\nDuring the battle\\, we see the expected death of Princess Leia. Because Carrie Fisher is dead. Noone would ever slight them for that. But in some ham fisted attempt to surprise the audience\\, instead\\, after being frozen solid in space- Leia not only lives- but force glides like Yondu from Guardians of the Galaxy\\, in a terribly cgi'd flight- back into a ship that does not explosively decompress because plot armor. \\n\\nDuring this travesty of a space battle\\, Finn and a newcomer- Rose- are doing a comedy bit where Finn- apparently back to being a coward- is trying to escape the battle. She stuns him\\, travels to a planet to help him find support for their fuel lagged ships- (Groan) all while teaching him the values of animal rights and the evils of capital gain. Ironically\\, i'm liberal\\, and these messages resonate with me. But in the film\\, they come off forced\\, ham fisted just like the rest of the plot. Additionally\\, it is revealed later that nothing they do actually impacts the battle\\, or any of the plot. And to top it off\\, Rose dies\\, killing herself to stop Finn from making what would have been an amazing and impactful sacrifice\\, and then revealing she fell in love with him during the several hours they knew each other with her last breath.\\n\\nThis is disney romance at it's worst. \\n\\nMeanwhile\\, Luke offers Rey three lessons\\, because she won't leave. She accepts her first lesson\\, descends into a dark pit filled with the dark side of the force\\, and faces her trial.\\n\\nIn what could have been an amazing moment of symbolism and a clarification of any one of the dozen mysteries surrounding Rey\\, we discover not only nothing- but less than. Whereas Luke left the tree aware of his great fear of becoming his father- Rey leaves with nothing. No lesson. No vision. No change. The theme of this movie\\, in short.\\n\\nAs the climax of the star wars 5k funrun in space concludes\\, a character we don't know and i can't even remember the name of sacrifices herself in Admiral Ackbars cruiser (Him having died earlier in a moment of battle without merit)\\, crashing it into the enemy cruisers to protect those fleeing the battle to a planet below. \\n\\nThroughout these scenes\\, interactions between Kylo and Rey have continued\\, through the form of Force Telepathy- a power never witnessed in the previous films\\, that it not explained in any way. As it continues to occur- and Kylo accidentally seduces her with his shirt off\\, rey decides from several conversations\\, the first of which she accuses him of being a murderous monster (Totally true)\\, to the last where she bafflingly decides there is good in him\\, and ditches her training to go confront him in the same throne room as Snoke.\\nIn the midst of this- Luke confesses\\, and we finally get one tiny little bit of closure on one single plotline from TFA. And god damnit\\, it is the worst possible thing you could ever imagine for anyone who loves Luke. It turns out\\, the reason Kylo is evil\\, is because one night\\, as he slept\\, Luke Skywalker\\, man who stared Darth Vader in the face- Who saved a mass murderer's soul and returned him to the light- whose primary trait is his never-give-up\\, always hope\\, attitude and immense bravery- snuck up on him and stood above him with the equivalent of a dripping blade\\, considering his murder\\, because\\, and i quote \\\"I sensed the dark side growing in him\\\"\\n\\nLuke Skywalker- Child murderer.\\n\\nThis is about the point i became outraged.\\n\\nThe following scenes i barely paid attention to. I wanted out. I no longer wanted to see what happened\\, but i stayed long enough to watch Luke die\\, of concentrating too hard\\, as he used all of his abillity to project himself in a 5 second lightsaber fight that had no fighting- in the last ten minutes of the film.\\n\\nThat's when i walked out. \\n\\nHappy birthday\\, me. And screw you\\, Rian Johnson.\\n\\nI am not coming back for any more. Star wars is dead for me. Thanks for the good run. I've seen and read Hamill's comments on the matter- and i am going to take his advice.\\n\\nThe original trilogy is enough- It's amazing- and i don't need more than that. Thank you Mr.Hamill. Your performance was the best you could do\\, and i thank you for it. For me\\, this is the end of the road. \\n\\nJesus\\, Snoke. Where do i begin. \\n\\nSnoke\\, the man who can sense everything\\, even his own disciples urge to kill him\\, is fooled by a ruse that he is openly detecting as he detects it. Without backstory\\, without any idea of who he is and what he can do\\, he dies. Who was he? Who cares. He's gone.","true":true}
