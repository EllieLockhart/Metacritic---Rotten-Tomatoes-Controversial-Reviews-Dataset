{"101487":105407,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan from the time I saw 'Star Wars' in 1977 watching 'The Last Jedi' was an exercise in the suspension of disbelief for 2 and a half hours.  Disbelief that Disney and Kennedy's team could be so off target\\, so wrong on so many levels\\, and leave us with a film which at this point in my mind rivals with The Phantom Menace as the weakest of the series.\\nThere were some good things in the film - some of the visuals were impressive\\, particularly with Rey's training and the Falcon (the Falcon always looks good).\\nBut there were so many thing that were bad about the film - here's a few:\\n\\n1. Luke's back to being the whiny brat while also being defeatist.  Oh and by the way he seriously considered killing his own nephew for some thoughts that Snoke could have planted in his nephew's mind (something Snoke demonstrated in TLJ he could do by faking a vision of Kylo's future that Rey sees).\\n\\n2. We get no backstory about Snoke at all - I guess Disney is planning a separate standalone film for that to squeeze more money out of us?\\n\\n3. Leia's able to use the force when facing her own death even when she's never demonstrated any force ability before\\, and we've never seen any sign or hint of her training (one would have thought that after 20 or 30 years Luke might have shown her some Jedi training but there's no hint of anything in the films).\\n\\n4. The basis of the original trilogy and the prequels was the origin of Anakin's power being the force (midichlorian's) itself and his eventual fulfilment of a prophecy of bringing balance to the force.  Are we now expected to think that the moment of balance was only him overcoming the dark side and killing the emporer\\, or was his example meant to show that an individual could balance the light and dark and find a way through both without being overcome by either? (something that Luke was meant to have learnt and carried over into his training of the next generation but apparently did not?).\\n\\n5. The skywalker bloodline is no longer the basis for hope in the galaxy?  We're now meant to believe that the most powerful being with the force\\, Rey\\, is a nobody from nowhere with no connection to the skywalker bloodline.  What a freaking disappointment - after building up the mystery of Rey's origin all we get is a homeless kid sold off for her parent's drinking debt.\\n\\n6. In the the midst of the looming defeat of the Resistance\\, we have this long\\, boring\\, drawn out race to run out of fuel\\, where the Resistance can call for help (and gets none)\\, where the heroes make a long distance call to Maz and get advice about who could hack the First Order encryption in the midst of a labour dispute (which side is she on - the employees or the employers?).  Where a couple of characters race off in the middle of the fuel race to get some help at a casino and return.  If its as easy as that to call for help then why wouldn't the first order call in some help of it's own to cut off the Resistance ships\\, and since it isn't the first order that's run out of fuel for a jump into hyperspace why wouldn't they just send a couple of ships a few light minutes ahead and then attack the Resistance back in normal space - why the hell would they just chase and chase the Resistance ships in normal space?\\n\\n7. Where are R2D2 and C3PO?  They've gone from being core characters of the original trilogy and the prequels (with R2 arguably being the only character who know the whole story since his memory wasn't wiped and who has a huge influence on what happens - watch the original trilogy again and when he's making noises and see how he tries to obstruct Luke from getting involved in the rebellion or becoming a Jedi)\\, to being cameo roles not involved any longer in a real way with the main storyline.  If you read the notes about George Lucas's original plans for the 12 films it was going to be R2 and Threepio that would be the constants.  If Disney is seriously going to end the skywalker saga with 9 and not continue with a 10-12 about the skywalkers then it appears to have missed the opportunity to make the final trilogy about the liberation of the droids - something hinted at in A New Hope's novelisation when Luke goes into the Mos Eisley cantina and his droids are denied entry\\, just like african americans used to be denied service in white restaurants.  The droids are the african americans of the Star Wars universe.  Luke recognises the injustice represented but decides that point in time isn't the moment to do something about it.  But here we are 20 or 30 years later and with all the help that R2 provided the Rebellion to help them achieve victory over the empire neither Luke or anyone else appears to have done anything to help free the droids.  Disney seems content to leave them be slaves rather than building to a final trilogy with an Abe Lincoln type figure leading a war to see all droids free throughout the galaxy.\\n\\n8. Where's the suspense left in the storyline now?   Kylo's in charge\\, the Resistance is pretty much washed up\\, nobody answered their call for help and their remaining 'hope' is a new generation of stable hands around the galaxy who will be 'inspired' by the rebel alliance symbol? to what end?\\nWe've got Kylo Ren taking on the leadership of the first order - in some ways I feel like rooting for him now because at least he's a skywalker\\, and he showed some elements of still having the light in him - he didn't fire on his mum and he seemed geniunely emotionally scarred by Luke's near attack on him while he was sleeping and seemed to respond to Rey's goodness.\\nRey's the last jedi after 3 simple lessons over the course of what time period? a day? 3 days? - at least in TESB they implied Luke's training took a few weeks and he still wasn't strong enough to go - whereas Luke and Yoda seem to have no qualms about Rey leaving her training in TLJ to confront Kylo and Snoke.  And why didn't Rey join Kylo - if she's so powerful and can influence him then why not agree to be co-ruler - get Kyloe to kill Hux and the First Order fanatics and bring peace and order to the galaxy together.\\nAnd what exactly is the Resistance actually wanting now that Snoke is gone?  The rebel alliance was trying to defeat the evil empire\\, the Resistance was trying to resist the First Order under Snoke - well Snoke's dead\\, Leia's son is now the leader of the First Order - why doesn't Leia just send a mental note to Kylo now that she can apparently use the force and say 'Hey son - why don't we sit down and talk about how I was wrong to send you off to that idiot brother of mine who tried to kill you when he saw a fake vision in your head that Snoke put there?  hope you can forgive me and your dad\\, and I'll forgive you too and we'll all put the past behind us\\\".\\n\\n9. So the future is now with the little stable kids around the galaxy being 'inspired' by the rebel alliance symbol.  Does that mean Episode 9 is going to be set 20 or 30 years after Episode 8? so Rey has a chance to raise a new generation of Jedi nobodies like her and defeat the evil failed skywalker family?\\n\\n10. The huge powershift in this movie in galactic politics also just didn't make sense - the destruction of a mere 5 planets in TFA (regardless of which planets they were)\\, just doesn't make sense to have shifted all allegiance from the Republic to the First Order - unless they're basing the galactic politics on modern day Iraq perhaps.  Perhaps they've got additional info in the extended universe but many of us continue to only regard the movies as canon and that the movies should at least contain sufficient information to follow the plot - something that Disney and Kennedy's team appear to have dropped the ball on.\\n\\nSo What can be done now to put things back on course?\\nThe one positive of Ep8 is that it actually leaves a pretty clean slate for Ep9 plotwise - unlike TESB or AOTC there are no obvious plotlines leading on from Ep8.  So Ep9 could do quite a few things which would redeem Ep8 and turn things around.\\nMy suggestions for Episode 9 are:\\n1. Kylo Ren either lied to Rey about her origin or he didn't know the truth - that Rey must be from the Skywalker bloodline.  We have a tradition in Star Wars of people lying to others about their origin\\, so Kylo was either lying to Rey\\, or he doesn't know the truth himself.  Make Rey Luke's daughter after all - either via Jade Mara or some other female character - who could even come back in Ep9 to explain Rey's true origin (maybe Rey's mother left Rey on Jakku to keep her safe\\, the same way that Yoda and Obiwan decide to put Luke on Tatooine).  After all\\, if Luke's the sort of guy who starts trying to kill his nephew for some potentially evil thoughts he's dreaming of then I wouldn't want him near my baby daughter either).   That would also explain how danger found Rey in Episode 7 regardless of where she was hidden\\, the same as danger found Luke - that Skywalker blood just keeps calling them back into where they are needed.  One of the major flaws in both the original trilogy and the prequels was Lucas's failure of imagination in including an evil female character - there was ample scope for Anakin to have been helped on his way into the seduction by the dark side by a female character along the lines of Lana Turner's character in the 3 musketeer film with Gene Kelly.  Perhaps include some backstory female character of a similar morally murky nature that at one point physically seduced Luke?  Either that\\, or perhaps Anakin was seduced by a female when he was working for the Emporer and the female left and had a baby who didn't know they were strong with the force (maybe becoming a drunk because they kept having dreams and thought they were going crazy?) and then they had a baby Rey?  Either that or have Rey be another virgin birth like Anakin?  Any of those would make more sense than Rey being nobody special from nobody parents crap we've been served up so far for Rey's origin.\\nThe idea that Kylo lied to Rey about her origin\\, and that Luke (if he knew) wouldn't say anything about being her father (or if her origin was from Anakin\\, of being her half-uncle)\\, would follow clear precedents in ANH and TESB by Obiwan and Yoda - they encourage Luke to think Vader killed his father\\, Obiwan ensures his own death\/ascendance is seen by Luke as Vader killing Obiwan (Luke's now substitute father) - but they also don't tell Luke that Leia is his sister - kind of a big omission for a young guy who thinks his entire family has been killed by the empire.  Having it turn out that Kylo lied would also explain his mysterious keen interest in 'what girl'\\, when he first hears of Rey being seen with BB8.  He seems more interested in there being a girl involved than is justified by the events we see - after all\\, he's not particularly interested in either Poe or Finn having been seen with BB8 - just the 'girl'.  Has he had some vision\\, or been advised something by Snoke\\, or read something somewhere\\, or been told or seen something while being trained by Luke\\, that makes him recognise the 'girl' is not just a 'girl'?\\n\\n2. R2 and Threepio need to be included front and centre in the storyline of Episode 9.  Lucas's original idea for the 12 films (re-read the original interviews people) - was that the two droids would be the only recurring characters throughout all 12 films across the generations.  R2 particularly could be key to my point 1 above - did you notice how R2 didn't reactivate in Episode 7 when BB8 arrived with the missing map section\\, instead R2 only reactivated when Rey arrived?  This confirms Rey has Skywalker blood and that R2 knows it.  R2 is the keeper of all the Skywalker secrets and has been owned by Anakin to Luke and now Rey with no memory wiping (unlike Threepio).  (On a side note\\, in the eventual reboot of the prequels in 20 or 30 years\\, one plot point that needs to be changed is that Anakin should build R2 from scratch not Threepio - that would have made a lot more sense since R2 would have been a huge help in Watto's junkyard and Threepio being a protocol droid makes much more sense being in Organa's service).\\n\\n3. Kill off Hux - that raving lunatic has no story purpose now (if he ever did)\\, and his days of comic relief are now over too - why on Earth would Kylo keep him around when he already hated him before?  Perhaps that becomes the end game of Ep9 and Kylo's way of atoning for killing his own father Han - that he manages the Galaxy and the First Order into a situation where they do bring order to the galaxy\\, but he maneouvres them into a final betrayal where Hux and the other First Order fanatics die at the hands of the Resistance\\, and the galaxy is left with a freed stormtrooper cohort who\\, like Finn\\, join with the Resistance to finally bring about peace and order throughout the galaxy.\\n\\n4. Have some real romance in the film - Rey with Poe? Rey with Finn? Finn with Rose? Poe with Rose? Rey with Kylo?  And if not with Rey - shouldn't Kylo get to enjoy some female company? (he's a young guy\\, has the keys to the galaxy in his hands\\, if Rey won't join him then surely someone else will?).  Lucas was no good at romance except for Han and Leia\\, all other characters are basically sexless monks except for Anakin and Padme and their romance was handled abymally (another thing to fix in the eventual prequel reboots in 20 or 30 years).\\n\\n5. Just as Rey now has the Jedi books to learn from and explore (am I mistaken or did I see them safely stored in a drawer of the falcon in those closing scenes of the movie? - I've only watched the film once so far\\, unlike TFA I don't feel the need to see it again anytime soon\\, but at some point I will and will definitely check this scene again - even if I wait till the Blu Ray comes out in 2018).  So have Kylo also learn from Sith books\/relics and in the course of doing that have him discover Snoke's origin and find that he was in fact Darth Plagueis (ignore the ramblings of the Disney\/Kennedy collective that he wasn't - nothing else makes sense).  Snoke being Plagueis will provide a link back to the prequels (I'd thought they could only be bettered but now I've seen Ep8 I know the Prequels\\, particularly 2 and 3\\, actually weren't too bad at all).  It would also provide an explanation for Snoke's extraordinarily powerful force ability and his motivations.  And having both Rey and Kylo being on parallel journeys to explore their 'sides' force background and powers could potentially lead to them finally coming together in a grand battle of minds to achieve a balance in the force via this mind link Snoke somehow put in place between them.\\n\\nAll of this is just my humble opinion of course.  I am offering my opinion because I've been a very long term fan of Star Wars.  Watching Episode 8 was the first time I came out of a Star Wars film feeling like I'm not even sure I ever want to watch it again and I really don't want to experience that disappointment again when Episide 9 is released in two years time.\\n\\nSo I allow free use by anyone in anyway they want of anything and everything I've written above - my only wish is to see that Episode 9 is a far better Star Wars film than Episode 8 has turned out to be.  My great fear is that if Disney\/Kennedy don't turn things around that Ep9 might become the 1st Star Wars movie to actually lose money.","true":true}
