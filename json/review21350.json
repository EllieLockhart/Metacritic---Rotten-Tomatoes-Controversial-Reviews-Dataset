Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will honestly say I like Attack of the Clones more than The Last Jedi. This movie does literally nothing the critics say it does. I ranted to my friends for two hours about the awful aspects of this movie\\, while I couldn't talk for more than five minutes about its good points. They are so few and far between as to be nonexistent. There's maybe 4 good scenes in this movie\\, but they're all less than five minutes and everything surrounding them is bad.\\n\\nIn short\\, don't watch this if you're a star wars fan. Johnson has no respect for the previous movies and does previous characters a disservice whenever and wherever possible.\\n\\nAs with the last movie\\, the original trilogy characters are only superficial. In reality\\, they're whatever the director needs them\\, puppets Johnson is using to move his plot and his characters along. Luke and Leia do things completely against their characters. \\n\\nAll of the new characters in this movie are underdeveloped\\, and the characters from The Force Awakens only minimally developed from the last movie.\\n\\nThe plot meanders for about two thirds of movie\\, nothing really comes out of most of the events. A moment between Rei and Kylo right before the last act make it seem like something interesting will happen\\, but nothing ultimately comes of it.\\n\\nI can't go any further without spoilers\\, but suffice it to say\\, I hate this movie and will not be seeing the last in the trilogy. It was disappointing as a star wars fan and downright bad as a movie fan. Please do not waste your money or time on this.","true":true}
