Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel a disturbence in the force. I just got back from seeing The Last Jedi and am fighting through digesting this film. I didn't hate it as a film\\, but kind of do hate it as a Star Wars film. I'm actually struggling with words to describe my disappointment and feelings of betrayal about this film. I have seen every Star Wars film since the first Star Wars in 1978. The best way I can describe this film for me at the moment is that I feel like a part of my childhood just died. I sort of feel that the franchise has taken the classic hero's journey...to nowhere. I almost think it would have been better to start a fresh new trilogy than try to tie it to classic Star Wars movies. Something more like the TV series Rebels did\\, maybe a cameo or mention of the classic characters once in a while. The theme of this movie seems to be to \\\"forget the past\\, kill it if you have to\\\" and that is exactly what Ryan Johnson did to the franchise\\, he killed it - at least for me.","true":true}
