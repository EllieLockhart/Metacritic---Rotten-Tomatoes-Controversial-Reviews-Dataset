Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. sure\\, some things weren't answered like we wanted. but it gave a great star wars fantasy feel. I walked away from the movie feeling great that I watched it. People complained about some character development \\, but I didnt see it that way. I thought the characters were interesting and a great block into the next era of star wars. worth seeing!","true":true}
