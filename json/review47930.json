Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While individual scenes are highly entertaining the movie\\, on reflection\\, leaves a lot to be desired. The key problem seems to be the \\\"plot\\\" was merely a vehicle to move from one cool scene to another and when the implications of something in one of those scenes clashes with a later scene it's just ignored. Its not even a problem of plot holes which implies there is a coherent plot with a few issues. Instead it's like the movies is just a series of plot islands with only a vague connection to each other\\, let alone the events and characters of the previous movies. \\nI was entertained in the moment\\, but after the fact (which is the real test of a great movie) I am not impressed. Can they salvage it from here? Probably\\, but this movie is always going to be a gaping wound in the larger narrative I fear.","true":true}
