Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've spent hours listening to critical reception and fan theories\\, and short of a miracle this movie could not have turned out better. It's merely the fragility of old set-in-their-ways \\\"fans\\\" afraid of change that cannot adapt and lash out against the movie with its rotten tomatoes score. The way of the Jedi as it was is coming to a close\\, and the future is looking brighter than ever.","true":true}
