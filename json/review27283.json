Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only five minutes or so out of over two hours  train wreck felt anything like a true Star Wars movie.\\nThe acting was forced.  The dialog insipid. \\nAt no point did this piece of crap make me care about any of the characters.  \\nNo mourning over Han's death?\\nThe actor who played Poe Dameron was ridiculously over the top and\\, somehow wooden at the same time.   He has been good in other films (such as Sucker Punch)\\, but his rapidly bouncing emotional reactions made me wonder if he earned his acting degree through a correspondence course. \\nIn short...Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars.\\nIt was not even worth the price of a RB rental.","true":true}
