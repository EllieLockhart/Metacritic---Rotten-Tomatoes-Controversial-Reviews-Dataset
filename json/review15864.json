Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love The Last Jedi. Visually stunning\\, loved the new armored walkers and the crystal foxes\\, hell\\, I even love the porgs. It tells a deep\\, reflective story. We still have Chewbacca and the Falcon.  Keep the momentum going J.J. Abrams and May the Force Be With You All!","true":true}
