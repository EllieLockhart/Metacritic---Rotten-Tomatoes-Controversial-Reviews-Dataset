Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's sequel to JJ Abrams The Force Awakens can easily be described by a line that Luke Skywalker says in the trailer \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\". In some aspects\\, the unpredictability and the suspense are a good thing for this movie\\, however\\, some characters are changed in ways that don't stay true to who we think they are which may upset some.","true":true}
