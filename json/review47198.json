Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an awful piece of hot steaming garbage. This is definitely the worst Star Wars movie ever made\\, filled with so many plots holes\\, and terrible humor that made me beg for Jar Jar Binks to come on screen so I didn't have to hear anymore of their \\\"humor\\\". This movie also is again very similar to the Empire Strikes Back\\, and the entire thing on Canto Bight was just a waste of time\\, but the worst thing about this movie is how much it destroys the characters from the Original Trilogy. The only things in this movie that I liked was the planet Crait as it is creative and the designs for the Crait speeders\\, and Resistance bombers even though it is an impractical design\\, but other than that this is a terrible movie.","true":true}
