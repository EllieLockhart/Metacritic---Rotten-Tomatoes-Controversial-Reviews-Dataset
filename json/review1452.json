Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the franchise from the beginning (1977)\\, I loved this movie. Luke's actions at the beginning of this film are a perfect metaphor for the what this film is doing over all\\, chuck tradition aside and let's try something new.","true":true}
