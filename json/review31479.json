Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***SOME SPOILERS*** Yes\\, there were a few things that I didn't really care for\\, but nothing about the movie that I just flat out hated. I loved the movie and the way things transpired through out the film\\, minus the whole Fin and Rose \\\"mission\\\" that completely failed and didn't make any sense towards the plot\\, but whatever the case\\, it did however give us an in on the final scene with the small child at the end of the film at least. But overall\\, I thought this was one of the best movies without a doubt since Empire Strikes Back","true":true}
