Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see this movie as a Film. Not as a \\\"STAR WARS!!!!!!!\\\" movie. To be honest I would probably give it a 4\/ or 4.5\/5\\, but I find its score on here ridiculous so I've decided to push back a bit.\\n\\nMy MAIN criticism is this movie is a kind of mess\\, organizationally. Mainly because it's bursting at the seams with too many characters and ideas. Also\\, it follows the trend of current movies to favor scenes with lots of action and not enough dialogue\\, but I don't count that against it because that's the nature of blockbuster movies today.\\n\\nIts good moments are really\\, really\\, REALLY good. Like I said I didn't come into it expecting any particular type of movie. What I got out of it\\, at its very core\\, was a wonderful tragic romance from the same lineage as Jane Eyre or Romeo & Juliet. Hiding\\, a bit\\, behind a lot of spaceships and explosions.That's what this movie is and that's the best part of it. I honestly don't know how more people aren't focusing on this in their reactions to the film\\, and still bothering to mention all sorts of other details. I found Adam Driver's performance to be the most compelling and nuanced\\, really making you question his character's motivations and direction as the story progresses - in a good way.\\n\\nI also want to put in a good word for Luke Skywalker in this film! The choices they made with this character made total sense to me. I genuinely enjoyed Mark Hamill's performance\\, including some great humor along the way. And I thought he had a really fitting send-off.\\n\\nWas this movie perfect? No. Was it just as good as the average Star Wars film? Yes\\, absolutely\\, and sometimes better. Would I watch it again? Yes!!!","true":true}
