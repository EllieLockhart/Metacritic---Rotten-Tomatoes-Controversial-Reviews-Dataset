Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw the new Star Wars Movie and wow I gotta say....               \\n       WTF piece of Garbage did I just walk out of! The Entire Movie theater was dead silent when the movie ended you could just see the despair and utter disappointment on everyone faces as everyone silently walked out the movies avoiding eye contact with each other as if we just witnessed a murder and were trying to cover it as if nothing happened. IT WAS ALL FILLER NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENS! And I never laughed once it was so fucking corny tons of derp de dur moments even kids thought it lame. The worst part is That Everyone built so much GodDamn HYPE to this Piece of Shit Hollywood Claimed IT WAs THE GREATEST STAR WARS EVER SMH Ive Seen Pornos with better writing. AND THAT FUCKER RIEN JOHNSON IS GETTING 3 MORE FUCKING STAR WARS MOVIES  TO BUTCHER. AND SOME OF YOU GUYS ACTUALLY SAW IT AND WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN????WTF???\\n\\nI only paid a $1 and I still feel ripped off!","true":true}
