Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"luke's character got butchered\\, yoda is advocating for book burning\\, and in the first order everybody is a retarder.\\nthe mouse paid the critics again. maybe if you are a 12 years old (or you have the mindset of a 12 years old) you can enjoy it\\n\\nif you read any spoilers\\, believe them. they seem retarded\\, but they are true\\, all of them","true":true}
