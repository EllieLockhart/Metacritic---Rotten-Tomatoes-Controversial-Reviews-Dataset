Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kept the humor\\, action\\, romance\\, epic space and force battles of the original Star Wars trillogy\\, but went a new and daring direction\\, possing a intriguing question for the next installment\\, what is the future of the Jedi? The jedi as they were structured from the republic era\\, are flawed and doomed to fail\\, and so when Luke restarted their order with the same principals\\, they did so again. This suggest they need to evolve as an order and adopt a more balanced approach... I look forward to seeing where Rey and Kylo go with this in episode 9.","true":true}
