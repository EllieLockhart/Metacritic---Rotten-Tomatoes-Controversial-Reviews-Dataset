Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much wrong with this movie\\, both as a Star Wars story and simply as a movie\\, that it is difficult to even begin to review it.\\n\\nThe plot takes the biggest hit. It's sloppy\\, and doesn't really know where it's going\\, other than away from the First Order at full speed. The story is one big chase scene\\, and it's by no means exciting. The resistance\\, through various \\\"carefully\\\" constructed plot devices and inventions by the story writers\\, find themselves dying one by one as the first order picks them off as they retreat.  I say \\\"carefully\\\"\\,  because the writers had to find some way to make this even half-way believable. Gross incompetence by military leaders that would make General Custer blush.\\n\\nThe character development is a close second. Rey still finds herself more than capable of taking on any task thrown her way\\, does not need anyones help (let alone a man)\\, and spits in the face of anyone questioning her magical talents\\, still seemingly from nowhere.  Characters without flaws or room to grow and evolve become boring and fake\\, leaving the viewer completely uninterested in her \\\"great journey\\\". Finn is put on a random wild goose chase that seems to be thrown in as a side plot to fulfil the story writer's personal political agenda. He can't quite find his purpose in this series\\, and is quickly becoming a throw away character. Poe may be the worst offender. His character seems to regress from his actions in the prior film. Even with the military incompetence of Organa and Holdo\\, starting a mutiny seems a bit extreme.\\n\\nNow I have not mentione Luke. Well\\, unfortunately\\, he does not make an appearance in this movie. Instead\\, we got a bitter old hermit\\, wallowing in pity and self-loathing that is unrecognizable in any way\\, shape\\, or form as the beloved Jedi we used to know. The change is so extreme\\, that it can't be the same guy! But we are given cheesy and half-baked excuses for this turn of character\\, that it's embarrassing to even fathom someone could have come up with this. Clearly the writer either hated Luke\\, or knew nothing about him. Because I can't imagine someone would assassinate a character merely to circumvent the viewers' expectations...\\n\\nThere is so much more that can be said\\, but I fear dragging this review out will be compared to the long and tedious \\\"chase scene\\\" that was this movie. Bottom line\\, you can skip this one. Especially if you're a fan of the original trilogy. If may save you some heartache for our once beloved heroes of the rebellion.","true":true}
