Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you just like movies and want to have some fun go and watch it but prepare to suffer if you are really die hard fan of the world created by george lucas\\, please don't see it. I'm done with disney's star wars.","true":true}
