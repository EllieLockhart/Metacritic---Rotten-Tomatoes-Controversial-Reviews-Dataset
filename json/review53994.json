Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is as if the writer hadn't seen the previous movie\\, let alone the original trilogy. Not only did this movie utterly demolish any buildup created by The Force Awakens\\, it also maliciously develops previously established characters into either idiotic or sinister character arcs. Watch the Scoundrel's Cantina review\\, as they have succinctly transformed my hatred for this film into an undeservedly more dignified critique. Long story short\\, this film was a dumpster fire.","true":true}
