Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story and screenplay is messy\\, convoluted\\, lazy\\, nonsensical and  poorly written. The filmmaker ignored and contradict setups from previous films. There are blatant editing mistakes. The film waste too much time with the slow chase sequences\\, miscommunication for drama\\, establishing bland new characters. The themes and forced messages was preachy\\, hypocritical and dreadful. The movie wants to deconstruct and destroy what came before instead of honoring and building upon it.","true":true}
