Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can you have a Star Wars movie with not even one lightsaber battle? The story was so full of holes it was frustrating! I love all things Star Wars but this movie is an embarrassment to the franchise.","true":true}
