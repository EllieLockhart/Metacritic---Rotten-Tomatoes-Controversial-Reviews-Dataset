Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow... just wow. How could anyone think that this movie is any good? How can it get the positive reviews that it's getting? I never believed that Disney was paying or bullying reviewers\\, but now I'm starting to because it's the only way this movie gets the certified fresh rating.","true":true}
