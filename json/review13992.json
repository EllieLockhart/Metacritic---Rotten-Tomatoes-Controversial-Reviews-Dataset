Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have not yet gone to see this movie and you are a Star Wars fan don't go. Disney needs no more of our hard earned money.

Every single main charachter is walked back from where things ended with TFA. \\n\\nEvery male charachter is disrespected with the script and made to be weak or a buffoon. I am not sure why someone's politics are showing in this movie and only the women get to be nice\\, noble and heroic. I'm guessing Kathleen Kennedy and whoever else is responible for this script has something to do with it.\\n\\n\\nWe sci-fi lovers have always treasured strong female rolls in our Star Wars and many other sagas you get the feeling watching this that the writers didint even bother to watch any of the other 7 movies\\, and they certainly did not pick up a book.
