Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1) skype esp? really?\\n2) Leia's spacewalk -___-\\n3) the quirky chase and escape scenes with Finn and Rose were useless to the plot\\n4) the humor was overdone to the point of being uncomfortable\\, and made it feel like a DCOM movie... Disney went way too disney\\n5) you betrayed diehard fans by throwing every potential backstory and twist in our face. Who is Snoke? doesnt matter. Who is Rey? doesnt matter. We live for that stuff!","true":true}
