Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did enjoy some of this film but there was a lot that I really hated\\, not simply disliked but HATED. Luke has been turned into a morose\\, cowardly\\, murderous douche-bag who looks like Sam Kinison. Finn is still an unfunny\\, bumbling\\, coward that brings nothing to the story. Rey's character was improved in my opinion however overall the story is a downer\\, the whole side story of Finn and Rose running off to Casino Royale was dull and ultimately stupid\\, introducing Benicio Del Toro's character was pointless\\, those little pog things were annoying and a vein attempt to create new merchandising for Disney. Snoke and Rey's backstory's being shrugged away as nothing was lazy and... stupid! The space battles were cool but there's little to like in this smelly nugget of sci-fi fantasy. As soon as he shuffles out of this mortal coil Lucas will spin in his grave!","true":true}
