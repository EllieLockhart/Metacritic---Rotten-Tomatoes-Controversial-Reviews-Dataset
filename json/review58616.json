The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So\\, let's get started. Gameplay:everything is great\\, the physics and other technical aspects are worked out just perfectly\\, there is nothing to find fault with. Locations are huge\\, hordes of infected-a separate theme of the game. Because of the power of the console\\, the developers allowed themselves such a Fitch\\, which brought additional success to the game. Music: everything is great\\,So\\, let's get started.

Because of the power of the console\\, the developers allowed themselves such a Fitch\\, which brought additional success to the game. Music: everything is great\\, Gustavo was hired again\\, he made great soundtracks. Plot:here you can already turn around. It is divided into two lines\\, let's say:the love line and the revenge line. The love line after the final remained\\, personally for me\\, under a small question. Although Druckmann said that the story is complete\\, so far\\, but I still do not understand the relationship of the main character with her friend. If this was explained\\, I would understand better\\, and so\\, this plot point seems to end near the end of the story\\, but still the question arises \\\"what's next with them?\\\". The essence of this chemistry is revealed\\, which is a huge plus. Of course\\, I would like more details\\, but perhaps we will learn about this in the third part. But even here the opposite occurs:I can't yet imagine what you can come up with in the third part of the game. It seems that the story has come to its end\\, but I want something more explosive\\, so to say\\, the end. Throughout the game\\, you sit there and don't understand what's going on\\, but by the end\\, everything is connected. Revenge... Well\\, everything is clear here. A parallel is drawn between Ellie and another character. Revenge is a component of their goals\\, and you understand it during the passage. Revenge breeds more revenge\\, as does violence. You sit there and think\\, when is this all going to end\\, do they both need it? In the pursuit of revenge\\, both ruin their destinies\\, their peaceful lives\\, as a result of which they lose a lot. No one thinks ahead\\, everyone is driven only by this feeling\\, and it is impossible to stop\\, the process is already started\\, what was the point to start? You\\, as a player\\, play for both sides\\, and by the end of the game you just want it all to stop\\, because there is nothing to fight for. You seem to be halfway across the country\\, but is it worth the loss?\rThus\\, the game we've been waiting for\\, has paid off in spades. Heavy and scattered pieces of the plot weaves into one lump at the end of the game\\, and you understand what you wanted to convey Druckmann. Strictly my assessment:9.4\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
