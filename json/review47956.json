Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it has some intriguing moments\\, there is way too much incompetence to consider it good. Luke's portrayal\\, improper use of comedy\\, blatant contradictions of the previous film and tons of plotholes. All of that makes it an unenjoyable experience. It has little excuse to be this amateur\\, with the competence and foundation of the previous outing.","true":true}
