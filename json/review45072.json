Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Under the disguise of (truly) impressive visuals\\, audio and cinematography lies a very disappointing story littered with illogical plot points\\, a handful of unnecessary political messages and a solid dose of forced humor.\\n\\n\\\"It's time for the Jedi to end\\\" and \\\"let the past die - destroy it\\\" are not-so-subtle subliminal messages from the Disney creative staff as they actively do everything possible to rip apart a universe\\, and the characters within\\, that so many people have come to adore. All in an effort to bring in as much money as possible from younger audiences while alienating past generations of fans. Solidifying a future for the franchise with little regard for the people who kept it going for the past 40 years.","true":true}
