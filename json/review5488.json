Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"destroyed saga. Jedi meant nothing\\, Jedi prophecy episodes 1-3 meant n. Aniken journey\\, Luke journey meant nothing. Anyone can be a princess\\, I mean Jedi. Thanks a lot Disney! First they wiped out the books\\, now Episodes 1-6 did not even exist or play into the store line. Fans waited a long time to see Luke and he was underwhelmingly used. I can't bring myself to watch this again or watch 9.","true":true}
