Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no words for how disappointing this movie was. The plot was boring\\, uninspiring and pointless. The storyline doesn\u2019t progress at all. The acting was terrible. The jokes weren\u2019t funny\\, and often times just awkward. Overall the movie was insulting to the Star Wars franchise. The only saving grace was the graphics and scenery\\, but you\u2019ll still probably leave with a bad taste in your mouth. Save your money.","true":true}
