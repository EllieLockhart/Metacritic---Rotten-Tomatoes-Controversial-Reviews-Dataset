Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't love this film\\, nor do I hate it. It's a good and mostly solid entry into the Star Wars Universe. The action\\, cinematography\\, acting and MOST characters are\/is great but on the other hand\\, there are a few plot holes created from established things in the Force Awakens which most likely won't be resolved and questions brought up by episode 7 that will most likely never be answered for reasons I can't explain. The side mission with the new character Rose and Finn from episode 7 is focused on far to much and in some ways\\, that I won't spoil\\, remind me a bit of the prequels\\, particularly in cgi. In the end\\, this plot thread feels like it could have been cut from the film or drastically trimmed down. However\\, the relationship between Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey is very interesting and the development of characters such as Luke Skywalker and Po Dameron is mostly handled exceptionally. The film overall was an enjoyable watch with many unexpected things scattered along the way that kept me intrigued but also with a few short comings that unfortunately prevent this movie from being great for me and particularly the audience but to another extent where this film is disliked and even hated by many. Dispite what many may say\\, this is not a terrible film\\, there's fun to be had and it is in no way as bad as the prequals (I'm mainly talking TPM and AOTC when I say this because I honestly don't really mind ROTS).","true":true}
