Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's finally here\\, the next episode of the Star Wars saga. Don't worry\\, I'll stay away from all plot elements and vaguely talk about what I really enjoyed about this movie. I chose to skip every single trailer for The Last Jedi with the hopes of not knowing anything before seeing it. And I am so glad I did this\\, there are so many surprising moments\\, my jaw dropped so many times. The movie starts and you're right in the thick of it\\, it starts off as a blast\\, and ends that way. The character of Luke was handled very well as a very\\, very broken man. Mark Hamill really pulled it off\\, and he gave what might possibly be his best performance as this character. Everybody who returns from The Force Awakens is stellar once again\\, including of course\\, the legendary Carrie Fisher\\, rest in peace. This movie was also hilarious\\, it got me laughing so hard at certain moments. However some of the humor didn't land at all. Of course the special effects are amazing\\, because it's Star Wars\\, and Rian Johnson had a vision that was clearly well realized. The true strength of the movie lies in it's surprise\\, and it's 2 hour and 32 minute run time allows for much more things to occur than you think. Those who are skeptical of Porgs will not be after this movie\\, they are so adorable in every way. I only have one issue with this movie\\, and it involves the Finn and Rose storyline which felt like a detour to the overall story. Thest Jedi made me cry\\, gasp\\, scream\\, laugh\\, and loudly applaud. Comparing it to the past is a disservice to how good the movie actually is. Rating: A-","true":true}
