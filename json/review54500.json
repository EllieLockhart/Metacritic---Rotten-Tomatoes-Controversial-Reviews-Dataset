Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love movies. I love the Star Wars movies but this is not a Star Wars movie. It may look like a Star Wars movie but it disregards all the internal logic that has been created through the last six movies and Clone Wars TV show and that's what breaks the spell and makes it something else. I'm not saying I want the same movie over and over and over but the Clone Wars TV show showed proof that there are great news stories in the Starwars universe it just requires good people to tell them. Even if it was not a Star Wars movie I would have been harsh with it because it's full of plot holes\\, bloated and at the end of the day the movie would have been over in 5 minutes had they just turned around and rammed the cruiser at hyperspeed. Why didn't they just get a fleet of rebel cruisers to do that to the death stars? And one other not so minor point if the rebellion became so weak after ROTJ then they have no legitimacy to govern and are now a terrorist group since there call to arms did not resonate with the galaxy population. See Disney the old canon had both internal logic and still had lots of places for conflict and metastory telling.\\n\\nAnyhow this is the first time I've ever signed up for one of these sites just to remind Disney that legitimacy comes not from who owns something but from the people. And that's why the rebelion won in the original Star Wars.","true":true}
