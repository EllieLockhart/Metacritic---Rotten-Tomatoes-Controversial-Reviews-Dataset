Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hot garbage\\, spits in the face of the fans that kept this franchise going. It's not a movie\\, its a starwars themed political ad for feminism\/ white man hate. The longer I think about the movie the madder I get that they ruined starwars. You don't have to make every man in a movie out to be an idiot and or Nazi to have strong female characters. Kennedy at Lucas films has to go and RJ needs to have his trilogy deal revoked I won't be watching it if he or Kennedy are involved. beyond that\\, it's still poorly written and throws the continuity of star wars out the window. I can't believe the character assassination of luke. not even mark himself agrees with how they did luke\\, sad just sad....","true":true}
