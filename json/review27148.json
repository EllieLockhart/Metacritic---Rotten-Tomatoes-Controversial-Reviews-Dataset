Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies in the franchise. I left the theater having no recollection of a \\\"good \\\" part. I've enjoyed every SW movie up until this. I don't consider myself a huge fan either. At the end of the movie the characters are exactly where they were before it started(minus a few cool things set up in The Force Awakens). \\nOverall\\, incredibly bad. This movie takes 2.5 hours to get nowhere. I found myself cheering for the villains because everything the rebellion did was so stupid.","true":true}
