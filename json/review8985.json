Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the first moment when Luke tosses Anakin's saber I was startled. The movie continued to jolt my expectations and I was engaged through the whole of it. I instantly joined several discussion groups (something I hadn't done before) and we were all examining the movie. The only thing that stands out as weird was Leia force flying in space... everything else was amazing. I will be watching this again and again. It is better than Empire for me. Finally\\, it's not just a fight between good and evil but it is embracing complexity like we haven't seen before. Even our villian is 'unfinished' in his drive to become the evil he imagines he could be. Wow. I'm still amazed.","true":true}
