Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Straight trash! Overall appealing visuals and decent acting\\, but when put into the context of the Star Wars world....absolutely no coherent plot line.  Very disappointing character development...who knows how many more movies Disney will pump out just grabbing for more cash.","true":true}
