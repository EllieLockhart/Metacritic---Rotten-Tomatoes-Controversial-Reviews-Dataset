Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the movie but there were some major issues that made me unhappy after watching.\\n1. Luke's character deserved better. \\n2. Why no training scene for Rey? Apparently she can turn ninja and control the force with no effort with zero real training. \\n3. There was a build up of who was Rey's parents and then they end up being bunkers. What a let down. \\n4. There was a build up of who Snoke was and then they just kill him off so easily and offer ZERO explanation of who he is. \\n5. Most females are seen as smarter than men and most male characters are stupid\\, goofy fools. Way to alienate for no reason. \\n\\nSo all in all I was disappointed after waiting 2 years and I won't  get over excited for the next one. May even wait until it comes out on Netflix.","true":true}
