Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyed the effects\\, but the plot was lacking big time. More than the Force Awakens. A lot of questions that I would like answered. How did the first order come about after the empire was defeated. Who\\, what\\, when\\, where\\, why is Snoke? What happened to the knights of Ren? I don't like Skywalker being made into some hermit who doesn't care. The way he died was weak. Why does he die by projecting himself? another question that doesn't get answered. Too many questions with not enough answers. ","true":true}
