We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Although the game is astonishingly beautifully done\\, what cautivated me from TLOU 1 was the dialogs and the characters. Part 1 storyplot was motivated by love\\, being that love at the beggining broken from Joel\\, but Elie manages to heal that and it\u00b4s what drives the plot ultimately to me. In a very sick and apocaliptical world they manage to help themselves and the story plot leaves you with a wonderfull feeling of father-daughter love story.\r\rThis second part is the opposite\\, it does not build upon anything good\\, it left me unhappy to pay this story. In my opinion\\, although the game is well done\\, the story is a failure\\, and that was what i tought was most great from the first part\\, and what compelled me to get the second. A shame\\, i was hoping to play a game that left me that same good taste in the mouth\\, a story about pushing yourselve to be better. TLOU 2 is the opposite and leaves everyone broken\\, and you are just part of it without beign able to do anything about it.\r\rThis was not a story that i wanted to experience\\, in my oppinion the plot is bad\\, it doesn\u00b4t matter how well it\u00b4s done. If a movie plot is bad it doesn\u00b4t matter how well it\u00b4s done\\, the movie is bad. This is the same in mu oppinion.\r\rAnd i do not expect to play the game ever again\\, i regret even playing it the first time. I did play TLOU 3 times\\, even with the PS4 enhaced version\\, and is still one of my favorites.\r\rA three is what this game deserves\\, and only because it is very well done.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
