Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had a dark plot that shot itself in the legs with the campy comedy thrown in throughout. Mich of the supporting character's actions felt pointless\\, even though they recieved so much screen time. Though Kylo Ren and Rey's journey throughout the film was brilliant on both a writing and acting level\\, Rey still seems like a Mary Sue\\, not earning the power she displays throughout. Ultimately\\, the films worst mistakes were in its use of older characters from the original trilogy. Leia had a rather cheesey moment where she uses the force in a strange way\\, but this is never developed or ever mentioned again. Luke Skywalker's actions seemed like they were written by someone who has never seen the original trilogy. The man who refused to kill Darth Vader even though Yoda and Obi wan tell him to\\, contemplates murdering a youth in cold blood. The film has a skeleton of a great plot\\, especially where Rey and Ren is concerned\\, but cannot surmount its poor treatment of old characters\\, campy jokes\\, and its obvious need to sell children's toys of a plethora of cute animals reminiscent of the ewoks and Jar Jar.","true":true}
