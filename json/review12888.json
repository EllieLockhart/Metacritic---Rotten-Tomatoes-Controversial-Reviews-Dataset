Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didnt really enjoyed it that much.\\nMost of the film was surprisingly lame to me: half of the jokes hurted my soul a little bit\\, many interesting characters had no interesting development during the movie\\, the strategy behind the two sides of the war are mostly absurd...\\nAnd dont get me started with Rose and Finn. Oh boy!! I couldnt develop any care for them. I even consider Rose tedious. And that \\\"casino\\\" plot...\\n\\nHowever it wasnt all bad. Kylo Ren story is pretty good\\, as it is his development as a character. Also Rey and Luke have an interesting vibe themselves. Snoke\u00b4s \\\"story\\\" is surprising\\, but i dont find it as bad as the rest of the people.\\nBasically\\, if the movie had focused only around the plot of the \\\"4 force users\\\" ill find it waaaaaaay more enjoyable. The rest is pretty much unnecessary.\\n\\nAn entertaining Disney movie\\, a really bad Star Wars movie (in my opinion).","true":true}
