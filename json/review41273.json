Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete dumptser fire of bad decisions.\\nThe story is incoherent and destroys every interesting plot point of Force Awakens and treats the Original Trilogy characters as obstacles (to whatever their goals are) rather than the greatest cinematic assets of all time. I am a life long SW fan and watched the movie opening night...and was BORED!!! I am a huge OT fan and I knew I was not gonna get a Luke centered story. Because the studio made it clear that they are more interested in introducing new characters than being true to the existing characters. But still\\, I went to the theater confident that a good movie was gonna be made.\\n Nope. The story has more plot holes than swiss cheese and the new characters are pointless\\, uninteresting\\, and force feed to the audience. There is nothing of interest to look forward to for the next movie. Really. There are no interesting plot questions...nothing. And of course\\, the character decisions for Luke are a massive betrayal to the noble idealistic hero that he was for 30+ years. I agree with Mark Hamill's comment to director Rian Johnson\\, \\\"I fundamentally disagree with every decision that you've made with my character.\\\"\\nI am shellshocked that ANYONE who made\\, or screened\\, edited\\, produced or funded this movie thought that it was a good story or a good product. I have no idea how a story\/movie this terrible ever gets the green light to go into production let alone actually gets completed. This movie isn't just a horrible\\, pathetic\\, misguided\\, and disappointing Star Wars movie it is a multimillion dollar exhibition of inept story telling of the highest order.","true":true}
