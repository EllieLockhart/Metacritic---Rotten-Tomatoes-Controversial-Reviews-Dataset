Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the original Star Wars at the age of 8 in the summer of 1977. I was hooked. Unlike many fans\\, I never dove into the many Star Wars worlds of fiction. I was honestly surprised to see Episodes I-III made. Honestly\\, as an adult  the prequels were good...but (as was Return of the Jedi)\\, well...for kids.  Today I went to see The Last Jedi and I found my \\\"awe\\\" again as a Star Wars fan. It was clear to me that it was the hubris of the Jedi that led to the rise of the emperor and Vader and the collapse of the Jedi. To have Luke experience that first hand with his effort to begin training Jedi (creating Kylo Ren)\\, leading him to self imposed exile was an interesting part of Episode VII. In this movie\\, the actions of Yoda and interaction between the old Jedi Master and Luke tied a lot of loose-ish ends together. (With Qui-gon\\, Obi-wan\\, Anakin\\, and now Luke all passed from the physical world and Yoda demonstrating what is possible from this disembodied realm paired with how Luke was able to project a physical form across the galaxy...let's jist say: I certainly don't think we've seen the last of Luke and Rey will have all the support she needs...). I am very pleased that the stark contrast between the light and dark sides of the force that has been the staple of Jedi\/Sith philosophy has been shown to be a \\\"wrong\\\" thing. I found it highly illustrative that on he Island\\, Rey was pulled to the dark side \\\"without hesitation(?)\\\" to the horror of Luke...and she then went to the place of manifest darkness to see what it promised...trusting her core self to be true...finding that it didn't have what she was looking for. That confidence of self\\, that lack of fear of the dark side\\, is the very flaw in the Jedi of the story to date (remember\\, love leads to fear\\, fear to hate\\, hate to the dark side...?). I believe this will play out in future episodes and will lead to the fall of Kylo Ren. He wants to burn the past and cling to hate\\, to the extent of denying his true self; betraying his core (remember\\, he failed to pull the trigger to kill his mother) and Rey simply embraces and is true to her core self...not the light or the dark. \\nFor me the franchise has finally \\\"grown up\\,\\\" and I am excited to experience the story as it unfolds. A must see!","true":true}
