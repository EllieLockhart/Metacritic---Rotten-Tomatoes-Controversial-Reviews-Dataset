Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Based on most media reviews and coverage\\, my low opinion of this movie would make me a bot\\, a cry baby fanboy\\, someone who cannot accept new things\\, or all of the above! I assure you I am one person who seriously DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE\\, and that is my opinion.\\n\\nThis movie DID NOT RUIN my childhood\\, as a matter of fact\\, my childhood was just fine\\, so lay off my childhood. I was glad to have seen the Star Wars trilogy\\, and even the prequels(they weren't great movies\\, in my opinion\\, but they are canon). But what it did do is ruin Star Wars\\, it's myth and even the movie structure they built over 6 films.","true":true}
