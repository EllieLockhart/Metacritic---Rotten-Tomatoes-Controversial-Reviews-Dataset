Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a life long Star Wars fan I grew up watching the movies with my mother. This perticular movie however left me\\, my wife\\, and my mother leaving theater highly disappointed as the plot completely disregards continuity and feels like a slap in the face. The integration of non plot relevant politics is forced down your throat and otherwise decent characters with great potential are squandered by being shoehorned in very specific aspects.There is no rich character development in Rey\\, Fin\\, or Holdo and the character of Luke is completely bastardized from the original trilogy. If you looking for a movie devoid of great storytelling so you can go about doing house work or surfing the web with a little bit of background noise this is the one for you.","true":true}
