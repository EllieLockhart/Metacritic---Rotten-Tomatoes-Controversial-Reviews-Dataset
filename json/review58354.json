Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few things I can appreciate about this movie is that I can tell Rian made an okay script\\, the special effects are amazing\\, and Luke Skywalker had more depth in this movie than the entire Episode 7 script\\, but that's about all. This movie is an overstuffed\\, poorly paced\\, and downright stupid movie. The movie is ruined by how incompetent the characters are. I'm going to reference RedLetterMedia because he summed up the movie perfect. The characters actions play like a comedy\\, they do something stupid and it leads to more stupid things. You see that would've worked in a comedy\\, but in a Star Wars movie that seems like it's trying to take its self somewhat seriously. Following up on what I said about Luke Skywalker\\, I think it's pretty interesting to turn him into a washed-up old man who has no hope. I think it's dumb that people are upset because they thought Luke Skywalker was this perfect\\, optimistic person. When in reality he's just a man. So it makes sense that he would have moments of weakness. That's all\\, see this movie if you like\\, but try to ignore the amount of stupidity in the characters\\, and the overstuffed plot.","true":true}
