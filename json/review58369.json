Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a decent couple of movies\\, this is unfortunately one of the worst episodes of Star Wars ever made. \\nFirstly the direction is extremely poor. The actors\\, who are good\\, are often completely unbelievable in the way they act\\, breaking the suspension of disbelief and making the audience laugh in unintended places. First piece of evidence isLuke Skywalker trying to kill Kylo Ren in his sleep. I guess he should have been frightened or conflicted\\, but he looks like he's having an ictus. Second piece of evidence\\, Kylo Ren and the ridiculous general trying to shoot Luke Skywalker from the ATs. They scream hysterically at each other like a scene from Spaceballs between Dark Helmet and Colonel Sandurz. Third piece of evidence is the lightsaber training of Rey where the actress is so bad at handling the weapon that she looks like she is swatting flies.\\nSecondly\\, what's up with the cheesy slapstick\\, furry animals and puns all over the place? There's no idiot character like in episode one\\, but the funny bits are clearly stitched on and don't meld at all.\\nThirdly the dialogue is at times quite awkward to listen to\\, for example:\\n\\nKylo Ren: [upon seeing Luke] I want every gun we have to fire on that man. Do it.\\n[the AT-ATs fire a barrage of lasers at Luke]\\nKylo Ren: More!... More!\\nGeneral Hux: That's enough. That's enough!\\n[the firing stops]\\nGeneral Hux: Do you think you got him?\\n\\nFourth\\, the special effects are awful. In practice there are humans and a series of cheesy animals that look like cartoons.\\n\\nLast but not least\\, plenty of plot holes. Why do the books end up in the Millenium Falcon? How does the MF save people from the exploding space ship? Etc. Etc.\\n\\nIn short\\, embarrassing.","true":true}
