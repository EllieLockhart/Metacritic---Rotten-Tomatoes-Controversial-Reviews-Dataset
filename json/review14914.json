Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I..I don't have words for this movie. I enjoyed The Force Awakens. But this movie has destroyed all interests in seeing how this trilogy ends. I would be perfectly happy if the 3rd movie starts with Luke opening his eyes and says\\, \\\"That was horrible\\, I need to train this Rey person\\\" as if it was all a future premonition that he had. \\nLoved Rogue One\\, Solo was the best o fthe new movies. But the Last Jedi as so many plot holes\\, total lack and respect for characters story progression\\, out of place comedy. Just no on almost every level. \\nThat being said\\, this movie is a visual delight\\, beautiful to look at.\\nI hope J. J can turn this dumpster fire around.","true":true}
