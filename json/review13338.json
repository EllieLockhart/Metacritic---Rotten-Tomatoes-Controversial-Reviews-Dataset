Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it because it was different and I did like the different take on Luke's character and how he faced something much more difficult than lightsaber combat. I do understand it's not for everyone but it worked for me. There's a couple of things that could've been better so not a full five stars. I guess I feel lucky it did work for me.","true":true}
