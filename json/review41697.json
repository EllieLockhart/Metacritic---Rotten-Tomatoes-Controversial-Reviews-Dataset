Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not a Star Wars movie. To say it is is an insult to the legacy of the series. I would give it half a star if it didn't mean my rating wouldn't get counted. I wanted to excuse Rey for being powerful in TFA but after watching this it is unexcusable. She is without a doubt a Mary Sue she is powerful for no reason she is capable of anything. The movie has so many plot holes it is baffling. They have also managed to turn one of the most loved characters in cinema history into the complete opposite of himself. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE","true":true}
