Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie. Why people are hating this movie makes zero sense. There is humor\\, conflict and above all a great story. Johnson definitely took this series in a fresh new direction. ","true":true}
