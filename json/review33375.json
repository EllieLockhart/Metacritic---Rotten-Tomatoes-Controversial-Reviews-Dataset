Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take everything you love about Star Wars.  Now replace the carefully crafted\\, uplifting story with nauseating political messages\\, omissions\\, disappointments\\, and just plain nonsense.  Throw in the debasement of beloved (male) characters\\, and you have an apt description of the Last Jedi.  Rian Johnson and crew have ruined Star Wars with a haughty\\, postmodern\\, SJW midle-finger.  Enjoy.","true":true}
