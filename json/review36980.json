Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was really about the dynamic between Kylo Ren and Rey\\, and to a lesser degree Luke.  And this part of the movie was very good.  \\n\\nThe rest was \\\"meh\\\" at best.  Poe should have been killed off; his character has become more annoying than actually contributing anything to the storyline.","true":true}
