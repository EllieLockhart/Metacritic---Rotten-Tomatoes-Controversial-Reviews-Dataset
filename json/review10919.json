Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haters gonna hate\\, but this movie is a pleasant surpirse and kept me guessing. The movie does leave a few things to be desired still\\, like is snoke really dead\\, but I am sure JJ will pull everything full cirlce in the finale.","true":true}
