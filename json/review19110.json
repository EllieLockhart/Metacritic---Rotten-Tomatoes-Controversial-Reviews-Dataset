Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to understand how this film could have gone so wrong for fans. They took every questionable plot point from Force Awakens and turned them up to 11; they took every good part from Force Awakens and made them meaningless. It's hard to see the characters we know so well being so poorly served. There are good moments\\, and the film is visually well done\\, but the story is as bad as I can imagine.","true":true}
