Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leftist garbage of the highest order. I'm not a Star Wars fan but for once I feel sorry for Star Wars fans who had to suffer this dirge from Disney. Not only should fans boycott Disney but they should boycott their shills on YouTube like John Campea\\, Collider and Chris Stuckmann who are parasites. Please dislike all their videos.\\n\\n Hollywood is dying because of this SJW propaganda\\, audiences are falling year on year as they're rightfully sick and tired of being lectured by dubious feminists and SJWs.\\n\\nAt the moment the only mainstream director who's making great Hollywood pictures on a scale is Christopher Nolan. I'd rather rewatch his movies at home than to go to the theater and waste ten bucks on a garbage Disney movie.","true":true}
