Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The diverging plots felt sloppy and uncoordinated\\, the humor forced\\, and the political messaging heavy-handed. It makes up rules as it goes along without explanation\\, so that you more often end up asking \\\"Wait\\, what?\\\" than go \\\"Wow\\, that's interesting.\\\" This isn't because people can't handle new revelations about how the universe works. It's because in this movie\\, they aren't revelations\\, they're just big\\, dramatic plot devices. The end leaves you with no excitement for episode 9\\, as things seem to be unfolding at random. Overall\\, Last Jedi is a flashy\\, fast-paced mess that feels like a product\\, not a story.","true":true}
