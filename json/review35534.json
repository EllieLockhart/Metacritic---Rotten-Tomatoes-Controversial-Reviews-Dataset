Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi. HOLY FLIP. In related news\\, Empire Strikes Back slips to 3rd place\\, behind Rogue One. This was the funniest\\, most amazing Star Wars yet. Avoid spoilers - part of what made it amazing is that EVERYTHING the internet said would happen didn't. When Luke said in the trailer \\\"This is NOT going to go the way you think!\\\" he was 100% truthful\\, and that's what made it awesome. As you start to realize everything you thought is incorrect\\, you're just infused with a \\\"what's going to happen NEXT??\\\" that keeps you on the edge of your seat.","true":true}
