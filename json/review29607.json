Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's bold but original take on the franchise clearly shows\\, for this installment is purely a standalone entry\\, with all the benefits of a brand new story that was so much needed in this new take\\, and while it is strong in its continuity and follow up narrative devices\\, it focuses almost entirely in the deliverance of new twists and developments\\, what'll eventually lead up to an inevitable split between fans\\, which only reveals the true power of this episode.","true":true}
