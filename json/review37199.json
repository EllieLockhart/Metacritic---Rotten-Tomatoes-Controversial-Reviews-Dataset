Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only way I know how to sum up this movie in a review. Is to describe it as if it were the final installment of a Trilogy\\, Tying up loose ends (and or completely ignoring) with absolution in these story plot points JJ Abrams was fantastically building into in \\\"the force awakens\\\".  It would've required Rian Johnson to get very creative in the writing with these plot point set ups\\, to be able to deliver satisfying payoffs we were building towards. Instead he decided to throw all of these plot point build ups over his shoulder. He clearly did not care about making an experience that was satisfying in these playoffs. I hope JJ comes back and does episode 9!","true":true}
