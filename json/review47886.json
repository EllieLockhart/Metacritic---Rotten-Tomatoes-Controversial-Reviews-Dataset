Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While being a decent enough action movie\\, it doesn't honor any history established in the previous films. Ability to use the force is just granted out of nowhere and the once extremely difficult to handle weapon that is the light saber can now be mastered in mere days. Furthermore this movie does not develop the characters enough to really empathise with them\\, nor does it feel like as anything is at stake\\, because of the fake out character deaths.\\nNobody does in Star Wars\\, toys must be sold.","true":true}
