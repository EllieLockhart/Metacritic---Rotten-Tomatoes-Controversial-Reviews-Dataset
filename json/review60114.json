Review: The Last of us Part II is a masterpiece without saying. I believe that this game shines in many aspects\\, but the one aspect that I believe it shines in \u201cand many others don\u2019t\u201d is the story. As much as this seems not to be the case\\, not only is the story a self constrained well written emotional rollercoaster\\, but in my opinion perfectly compliments the first game in almost every aspect\\, most of all seen through story. Let\u2019s talk about the major turn off in the story first. Joel\u2019s death\\, more importantly Joel\u2019s death at the hands of Abby\\, a random women whom you don\u2019t know off nor do you know her intentions until before you can even process it\\, has played a golf tournament whilst using Joel\u2019s unfortunate head as the driving range. At this moment you will want to quit. I did to\\, at this moment you will understand the hate\\, until you don\u2019t. Joel\u2019s death was necessary in my opinion. In a revenge story you need to be ok terms with the character\\, and if Dina had died\\, well you would feel sad for Ellie\\, but you would feel that way yourself\\, but by killing Joel\\, in such a traumatic and realistic manner (on the basis that in the world of The Last of Us\\, you do not to go out like Iron Man)\\, it makes you want revenge\\, not Ellie\\, you. Furthermore\\, you see and feel these effects throughout the game. When Ellie kills a pregnant lady\\, when Ellie looses everything\\, and here is where that perfect complimentary comes between part 1 and part 2. Ellie tells Sam that she\u2019s scared of ending up alone\\, and she doesn\u2019t want to loose everyone\\, and in part 2 that happens\\, but in the end. It\u2019s her relationship with Joel that stops her from tipping over the edge\\, as she remembers that she forgave Joel for the fireflies lie\\, and so she forgives Abby. Speaking of. Playing as Abby was an amazing experience. Seeing the other side of the coin only conflicted me more into realising who here was the villain\\, only deepening the characters. Not only that but once agin giving part 1 a deeper meaning\\, being that Joel\u2019s choice in the first game had consequences\\, his lie with Ellie\\, his wrong doing against Abby\\, and it all ties that together in the perfect sequel\\, that I believe is The Last of Us Part II\u2026 Expand","true":true}
