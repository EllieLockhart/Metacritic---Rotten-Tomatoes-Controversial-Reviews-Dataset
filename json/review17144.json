Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really hoped The Last Jedi would make up for the lazy script of Force Awakens\\, but it didn't. There were scenes that felt like the script came right from Return of the Jedi. I left the theater knowing that I was done with Star Wars. It was a sad day.","true":true}
