Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had so many expectations on so many storylines yet I didn't get what I want on any of them but I don't consider this as a disappointment i like when a movie tricks me or surprises me. I liked how the director made a risky move by adding different force powers and changing characters in directions we never expected. Last Jedi was very enjoyable for me.","true":true}
