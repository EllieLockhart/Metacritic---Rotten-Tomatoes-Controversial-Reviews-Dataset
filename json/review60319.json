The 2 points are for the programmers that spent 7 years to create this game. 0 point!! for the story.\r\rI am adding more to this review. I think Neil Druckmann is just too arrogant. He thought he can just manipulate the players who had a deep emotional binding with the characters in previous story of the last of us\\, by making the player feel guilty and force them to walk through \\\"the other side of the story\\\". It just does not work. He just underestimated that binding. We saw the same thing in the game of throne where Jaime battles against Daenerys. However\\, we have the difficult feeling of choosing either of them because we knew their stories and it took 8 seasons to build up those two characters. The strategy is to build up the characters and then create conflict. But in the last of us part II\\, Neil tries to create conflict and then build up the characters which is the absolutely wrong sequence. I hated it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
