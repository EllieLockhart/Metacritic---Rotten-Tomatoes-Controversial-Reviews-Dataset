Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disrespects old cast.  Movie is ok if it wasn't for that.  Had 2 or 3 good scenes.  I understand that Disney wants to expand the audience demographics but forgot proper character development.  No shocking story twist and also disrespected the prior Disney movie by not answering any questions.","true":true}
