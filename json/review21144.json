Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly looking forward to The Last Jedi\\, but was severely disappointed with the direction of the film.\\n1) There was so much build up for Snoke\\, but he turned out to be so easily beaten and there was no explanation about his origins.\\n2) Holdo was a poor excuse for a leader - she could have easily explained to Poe why she made the decisions she did instead of creating mistrust amongst her crew.\\n3) Rose Tico was a poor character - no real character development.\\n4) Luke Skywalker was painted out to be such a weak character\\, even going so far as to wanting to kill his own nephew in his sleep. This doesn't sound like the Luke Skywalker we knew from the previous 3 movies.\\n5) Leia had the ability to execute an unexplained force power without any training at all.\\n6) The casino planet seemed completely unrelated and did not fit into the flow of the movie.\\n7) Rey stsated that she already knew where she was from\\, and yet\\, was being called by Luke's lightsaber and the Jedi tree\\, which didn't really explain anything.\\nI would strongly recommend against seeing this movie.","true":true}
