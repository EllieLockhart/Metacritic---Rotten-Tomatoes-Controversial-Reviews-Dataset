Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fanatics are a crazy lot. To say that any of the prequels are better than the Last Jedi is insane. The prequels basically suck. The CG was not ready to take over yet\\, they had terrible writing and horrible acting. The only notable exceptions were Neeson and McGregor. While the Last Jedi was far from perfect\\, it was still a decent film. I admit the jokes were at times problematic\\, the casino planet gave me terrible prequels deja vu and Mark Hamill\u2019s acting was just OK. But I still had fun and am ready to continue my journey with the Force. These films are still better than anything Lucas could conjure these days. Lucas the magician lost any good new tricks a long time ago. Ready for JJ to get back in the saddle again.","true":true}
