Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They're some great scenes in this movie\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are remarkable in the film. But there are also scenes that make you notice flaws in the film\\, and plot points that fans will either love or hate. Finn's plot narrative in the movie is probably the weakest\\, and it kinda diminishes how good he was in TFA. Overall though it's an enjoyable movie to watch\\, but there are points in the movie that will split the fanbase.","true":true}
