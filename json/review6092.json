{"101487":116216,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, AKA the First Order\\, RUINED Luke Skywalker and RUINED Star Wars. The critics are just more FAKE News\\, bought by the First Order to give this horrible film 91%... Total sell outs. The original films are hurt by this trash. It's almost as if the creators of this film never watched the originals\\, nor cared to learn about what the fans wanted. Mark Hamill has been talking to these fans for nearly 40 years now\\, and Disney ignored everything Hamill suggested\\, which were brilliant suggestions. They treated him totally unfairly. \\n\\nThe result\\, is essentially the Mormon Church rewriting all of the religion of The Force and lying to us that this film is still authentically The Force. Being a Fanboy\\, connoisseur\\, collector\\, etc\\, for my entire life\\, 30+ years\\, I can tell you that Disney has hijacked the mythos of The Force and wrecked it. They have insulted the audience and assumed we are all fools. The film\\, in itself\\, is a tragedy.  Understand I'm being critical and also morning the loss of absolute cinema greatness. \\n\\nAlso note\\, that both Gen X and Millennials have memorised the Catechism of The Force for decades now. Loyal devotees to the films and mythos. What we just saw on screen is a perversion of truth\\, this is the star wars reformation and flat out heresy to the meaning of the first 6 movies.  \\n\\nNo mythos\\, no hero\\, no relatable characters\\, no heroic acts anchored in meaning\\, devoid of human nature\\, no exploration of family relationships... NOTHING RELATABLE... only thing relateable is the modern politics in the USA and Europe and the leftist agenda bleeds\\, painfully\\, into the film... The audience  wanted to go to a galaxy far far away\\, and what you get is CNN and MSNBC propaganda. When Superman Leah put on the magical underpants and started flying through outer space and checks herself into the ICU\\, I said I was done. Chewy becomes a vegan! The Captain's bridge looks more like the Yah-Yah Sisterhood than a bunch of military commanders!  All the men are buffoons and can't do anything right. The clergy of Jedi are now agnostic. The Resistance boils down to a bunch of Occupy Wall Streeters who with Benicio Del Toror's comments want to prove that Capitalism is awful and hurts people (meanwhile Disney just gave us the highest grossing film of 2017\\, since they hate capitalism so much). \\n\\nThis is so bad\\, that it actually makes the prequels better. Here's why... Episodes 1\\,2\\,3 were the brainchild of Lucas still. The mythos was fully intact\\, there was an actual plot\\, gave lots of answers\\, we understood the horrid nature of Anakin Skywalker even more\\, and all signs pointing to Luke as the ultimate hero of the galaxy. The sordid family drama was there\\, everyone had their flaws\\, we had character arcs\\, and sans Jar-Jar these films are looking better and better. A once unimaginable feat! \\n\\nEnter \\\"Mary-Sue\\\" (wiki it) AKA Rey. Outside of being orphaned (not a circumstance she can help) she is flawless. Needs no training\\, no mentorship\\, no guidance\\, can repair anything\\, fly any ship\\, and cries only from her right eye. She just runs around like Dory asking everyone if they knew her parents or if they know where they are.  Her only struggle... I don't even know why she is part of the Resistance or why she needs to meet Luke. She learns nothing from him and is in full possession and knowledge of the Force anyway (She must have a very high midichlorian count).  She basically leaves the island to move some stones for the Resistance members\\, and she confronted her new boyfriend Kylo\\, which then Kylo kills Snoke. There is no epic showdown\\, she just shows up and Kylo takes care of business for his new lady friend he's been snapchatting with via Snopes data plan.  \\n\\nBut getting back to Luke\\, the greatest legend the galaxy has ever known... So let me get this straight\\, you can save Darth Vader\\, but you can't save your nephew? not worth trying? Darth blew up planets\\, slaughtered children\\, tortured people\\, and Luke saves him because he senses good in him... but not Ben Solo... ok sure... An older\\, wiser\\, Master Jedi\\, just gives up and adopts this nihilist attitude. Luke now feels the order of the Jedi should just be extinct and defunct? That there is no good? There is either nothingness or evil? Talk about a hopeless mentality of these filmmakers. This is not the Jedi way\\, and Luke defeated much more powerful and more experienced villians in the past and liberated the entire galaxy from tyranny. Not feeling it though in this one... it is beyond lame. \\n\\nSo we end up having a Tupac at Coachella moment\\, where Luke teleports his image across the galaxy for the final showdown. Luke never leaves his island\\, he just stays gone\\, and hidden. He is not hopeful\\, he is not optimistic\\, he just wants to be a grouchy hermit on his island and die (oh and drink if favorite blue milk\\, which now we know where that disgusting stuff comes from). There is no more hero in him. He doesn't want to pay it forward and mentor anyone\\, doesn't want to train Jedi to keep the peace. He has his final acts of remoteness and cowardice\\, and once he expands all this mental energy he gives up his life like his mother Padme\\, lost his will to live and disappears... WTF? Really Disney! REAAALLLLY???!!! \\n\\nThis is reflective of our times\\, people not knowing history\\, lore\\, mythos\\, human nature... Kathleen Kenney and Horn really blew this. Rain Johnson's career should be done\\, as the man that ruined Star Wars.  Watching this film will taint the original ones. It's is deeply troubling and incredibly sad to witness this. 10 year olds are loving the flash and the popcorn\\, while the rest of the world is face palming and shaking their heads...","true":true}
