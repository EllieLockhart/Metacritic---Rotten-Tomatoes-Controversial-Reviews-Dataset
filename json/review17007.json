Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really dont like this movie. Its very flawed and the characters from previous movies have been destroyed and killed. Rey is not a good character and Admiral Holdo is horrible.  I hoped rise of skywalker was going to be better\\nAnd its not. Have seen the Rise of Skywalker. \\nIts not good","true":true}
