Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie of the Saga. A completely disappointing  facade that hides behind sub plots that muddy the water. The action build is slow and not believable\\, and the action is boring and predictable. The force is not used enough\\, and the lightsaber battles (all two of them) are sorely lacking ingenuity\\, skill\\, and fun. The entire movie felt like an empty shell holding some secret power that would emerge at the right moment only to reveal that the shell was\\, in fact\\, empty. I am angry that this was tried to be passed off as a compelling emotional story when the only emotions I felt for sadness and anger at the destruction of what could have been a great movie.","true":true}
