Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two weeks later and I am still so angry with what they did Tor Star Wars!!! They should re edit and do some re shoots and maybe if they can reduce this pile of shit down to 50% There might still be some hope left!","true":true}
