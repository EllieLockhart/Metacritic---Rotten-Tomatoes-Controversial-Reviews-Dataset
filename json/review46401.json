Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was pretty long and boring. If your into a star wars movie that has the slowest chase scene ever\\, no light-saber duels at all and some poor use of characters (old and new)\\, then this is the movie for you!","true":true}
