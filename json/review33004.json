Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was poorly conceived. Disappointed in how they portrayed Luke\\, and especially the manner in which he left the franchise. I literally threw my hands up in disappointment and disbelief. The special effects were superb\\, but so were the transformer movies and they sucked.","true":true}
