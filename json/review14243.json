Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this movie half a star not because it was a horrible movie\\, but because Star Wars franchise has potential for so much more. This movie was funny and had some good scenes in it\\, but the bigger part of it was full of plot holes\\, disappointed expectations and a bunch of pointless scenes about social topics that have no place in Star Wars universe. (My personal problem: wasted opportunity for Admiral Ackbar.) Instead his role was taken by a pink haired lady that looks nothing like a military admiral. I'm really saddened that Star Wars has become more political and infected with SJW ideology and political correctness. I guess this is the new order that we just have to accept\\, because Star Wars under Disney is not going to change any soon.","true":true}
