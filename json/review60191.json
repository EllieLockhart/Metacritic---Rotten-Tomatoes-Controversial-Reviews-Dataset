Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Bored.  Uninteresting tropes with a muddled\\, uninspired message.  Bad writing\\, cheap tricks\\, manipulation\\, and pathetic last minute twists to try to make the mediocre story have more punch.

At best this game should be compared to a run of the mill\\, throwaway\\, summer popcorn\\, action movie.\rThe gameplay is good.  Oddly enough\\, they wanted the game to be about how violence and revenge is bad.  But the gameplay where you commit this violence is one of the best things about the game.\rThe graphics and world environment are awesome.  Cannot stress this.  It's really great.\rThe actors themselves have done a great job.  They do their very best to make the story great and I cannot fault them at all.  Superb acting.\rEverything bad about this game\\, is the writing.  If you wanted an incredible story like The Last Of Us\\, you won't find it here.\rI'm going to give this a 3\/10.  As I said above everything is great except the story.  However\\, this game following the incredible story of the first one\\, that is what people expected\\, an incredible story\\, and didn't deliver at all.  Just...amateur honestly.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
