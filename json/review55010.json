Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was politically driven\\, insulting to both men and women\\, providing an unrealistic vision of the rolls of men and women do and act like.  It took the established universal ruled and method of behavior -of- established charterers and destroyed the universe.  It was full of plot holes and inconsistent variables that are far too involved and too lengthy to write here.  The director did not fallow the story line of the previous directors and decided to just \\\"do his own thing\\\".  This has single highhandedly shown that Disney and Lucas film are no longer up to snuff with the franchise.  I am sorry\\, but this film was a B script\\, with B directing\\, but with A list funding and name recognition.  This was a bad movie and should have never been made.","true":true}
