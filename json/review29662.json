Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" obliterates the franchise's status quo - for better or for worse - and gives us a film that demands both our respect and undivided attention - from the opening crawl straight on until its final\\, poignant frame.","true":true}
