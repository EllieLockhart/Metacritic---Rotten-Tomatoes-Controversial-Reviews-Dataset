Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely a flop. So disorganized with three different plots going on. The garbage\\, throw-away answer of who Rey's parents are is a middle finger to fans who spent so much time contemplating who she is. Based on the answer given\\, she shouldn't have any jedi powers at all. Why is she so strong? Rian Johnson should not be able to have creative control over any more of these movies. He ruined this movie.","true":true}
