Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was a fun\\, entertaining movie. Brought in new ideas to a franchise\\, and also had a few fun easter eggs. Just because it is different\\, doesn't make it bad. There were times some of the comedy relief was not needed\\, but the movie kept you entertained throughout. Those who say it was too different\\, also complained Force Awakens was too similar. ","true":true}
