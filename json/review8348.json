Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like a Harry Potter movie. Overloaded\\, boring\\, and incomplete. A lot happening\\, yet nothing happening\\, and it's mostly boring till the end. Didn't like any new character. Didn't like the new locations. Didn't like the old characters.\\nNo payoff from Force Awakens. Some great moments with Rey and Kylo\\, but not so much with Luke and Rey or with Luke and Leia.\\nThe animated series is better. The comics are better. This was a let down.\\nCan't deliver at this low level after we've had space epics like Thor Ragnarok\\, Guardians of the Galaxy\\, and Star Trek Beyond that are better defined and better developed.","true":true}
