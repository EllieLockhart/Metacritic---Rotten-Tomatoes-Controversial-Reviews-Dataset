Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"thar wusint a lite saber fight and i wanted 1 and now im sad also i thoghut the pengwins were funy cuz thay made me laugh when thay looked at chewbocka and sad cuz he ate it and i thohugt that it was blood and it scareed me when thay died i got 15\/20 on my test in spelling today and i think that is good but i liked the move","true":true}
