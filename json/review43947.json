{"101487":188821,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was ok the first time I saw it. But I like to see it at least twice before I leave a review. After watching it a couple more times\\, I think the Last Jedi has a few good things about it\\, but a lot of flaws. Overall\\, I feel it was a very disappointing movie. First the good points\\, Special Effects\\, cinematography and Music are on par with all the other star wars movie\\, which is good. The bad: Story line was unaspiring (slowest chase scene ever)\\, sub story (side adventure) was pointless\\, character development was poor and inconsistent. The story arc of the previous movie seemed disconnected. These are just a few of the many things I find faulty about this movie. I could go on\\, but I'd end up writing a 10 page essay. I hope the next one is better.","true":true}
