Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some am zing moments and it was an overall enjoyable movie.  and I'm truly good with a director taking the story in an unexpected direction. However\\, the story felt as if Johnson wanted to ignore some of the main questions we walked away from Epi VII with (mainly the backstory of some very central characters.) and from that standpoint I was pretty dissapointed. Also as far as Story goes\\, I'm all for suspension of belief when I go into a movie about laser swords and space battles\\, but some of the editing just made the story feel uneven and rushed at times and sluggish at other times.\\nYoda took some time to get used to visually\\, (why can't they get the puppet right??) but I loved his role in the story.  \\nAll that being said\\, I liked it\\, I'll see it again\\, and I look forward to seeing how they land this ship in two years. In the meantime\\, a stand alone story about Han Solo sounds like fun.","true":true}
