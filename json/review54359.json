Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no problems with the changes made to what many consider Star Wars cannon. My problem was with the poor character development and pacing of the film.  For example\\, new character Rose could have been completely replaced with DJ the code breaker (Del Toro's character) which would have set up the phase tech the rebels were using to escape on the pods and saved the entire casino\/alien horse subplot.  This subplot felt too rushed to be worthwhile and instead would have given the DJ character time to build up for a more exciting heist type feeling as they try to shut down the tracker and make his betrayal later feel like... actual betrayal.  His charter was cool and unique but his motivations were sketchy to say the least.  Help them escape prison\\, infiltrate the first order ship\\, and just to turn around and betray them. Why was he so willing to help in the first place? It didn't make logical sense.  Also\\, what was the point of Rey going down the black hole and touching the black wall?  What did that accomplish?  I can guess\\, but it felt like they were trying to touch on the scene where Luck meets Vader in the swamp\\, but not nearly as clear or impactful.  Another problem I had was after the struggle between the lightsaber and it explodes\\, it opens up on Kylo waking up and the General just saying \\\"oh yeah\\, she stole a ship and bolted.\\\" Kind of like\\, \\\"yeah\\, we saw that she was making a break for it and was like\\, meh...\\\" Then\\, she just appears back on the Falcon?  Way to choppy and lazy.","true":true}
