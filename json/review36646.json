Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is full of plot holes\\, the whole thing about using hyperspace as a weapon invalidates all space battles that have ever happened in the whole franchise\\, first scene of this very movie could have been resolved by sending 1 ship to hyperspace\\, didnt need to waste all those lives with the bombers\\, if that was a possibility\\, why no one have used it before? They could have destroyed the death star this way.\\nThere are just so many points that makes it an incoherent story\\, it breaks continuity\\, writer needs to remember it is part of a saga with well stabilished characters and set of rules.\\nAlso the whole film is a big social commentary propaganda\\, I go to the movies for entertainment and not to be lectured about feminism and bad captalism.","true":true}
