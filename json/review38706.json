Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writer ruined this franchise. My wife is one of the few cool chicks who loves Star Wars. She fell asleep for half of the movie. And that was 6 pm on a Friday night. It seemed like a bunch of 12 year olds came up with the plot. Terrible writing masked by cool effects. Then they advertise as the \u201cbest Star Wars movie yet\u201d. Who are they kidding?","true":true}
