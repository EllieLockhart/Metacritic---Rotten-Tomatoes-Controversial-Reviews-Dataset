Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went for the effects and the visuals - and it didn't disappoint. I didn't go for the story\\, the writing or the addition of any compelling characters - and I got what I expected. If you want to see the best special effects that money can buy on a huge and grand scale\\, by all means go. If a shiny object with less substance annoys you\\, perhaps wait until its On Demand.","true":true}
