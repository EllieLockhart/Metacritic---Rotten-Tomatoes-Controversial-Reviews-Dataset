Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overlong and uninvolving. Relieved when it finished.  Screening was full\\, but atmosphere was totally flat at the end.  No buzz at all.  BIG misfire.  SAVE YOUR CASH AND AVOID!  Carrie Fisher as Mary Poppins FFS?!","true":true}
