Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think Rian and J.J. had a bet to see who could trash Star Wars the most. I did not think it was possible to make a worse Star Wars movie than TFA but here it is. This movie completely dishonors Luke Skywalker in the most shameful way possible. If I were Mark Hamill I would have thrown the script over that cliff instead of that lightsaber and walked off the set. And seriously Mary Poppins in space? Really? The audience reactions were more entertaining than this P.O.S. film. People were groaning\\, murmuring\\, and shaking their heads in disbelief to what we were all seeing. Seriously it's like the executives at Disney HATE George Lucas and they just set fire to everything he built and are pissing on it to put it out the flames.","true":true}
