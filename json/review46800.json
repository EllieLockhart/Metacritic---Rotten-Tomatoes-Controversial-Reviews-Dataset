Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"well its good oc. but id like to point a few things\\n\\n- I like hoe the portray Kylo and poe in this movie\\n- i like the ren rey fight with the praetorian guard scene\\n- holdo is now one of my fav char\\n- i dont really like finn and rose plot\\n- i need more story about rey\\n\\nanyway i love star wars saga and id watch all film related to it.","true":true}
