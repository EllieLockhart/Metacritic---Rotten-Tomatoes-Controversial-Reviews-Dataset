Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst movie in the franchise. Yes\\, even worse than episodes I- II. Campy\\, bad plotline\\, character incongruency\\, forced nostalgia- these are just some of the issues with the latest movie. Admittedly\\, I loved Rogue One and didn't mind the Force Awakens and had assumed an upward trend in Star Wars. I was wrong. The last half hour was so comically bad and corny that I was audibly groaning in the movie theater. Something I've never done.","true":true}
