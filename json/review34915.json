Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is a middle finger to the audience. When I was walking out the cinema I remember thinking did the director and writer even see the previous film or any other star wars film. All through the film it was constantly preaching political messages getting in the way of the story\\, although the George Lucas films did have this at times\\, but it was very subtle. It basically treats the audience like they are idiots.  So many poor characters written badly to be honest I feel sorry for the actors in the film because I feel they were made to look like fools. Once again they ripped off the original trilogy episodes 5 and 6\\, so extra marks for originality (sarcasm). I feel I could go on much longer put trying to keep this short so I will simply say this worst stars film EVER\\, yes\\, worse than Phantom Menace. In fact watching how poor this film is it makes me appreciate the episodes 1-6 even more and I will not be going to see episode 9 unless drastic change in 'Disney Star Wars'.","true":true}
