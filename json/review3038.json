Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad plot\\, all the excitement from the Force Awakens are down to nothing in this installment. Disney gave me a feeling that they are using this installment as a platform to build more story line for the Star Wars franchise. The humor element just does not work in this installment especially the prank call in the beginning. However there are some good scenes like Rey in the Black Cave\\, the ultimate darkness is actually reflecting the desire of your inner-self. Nevertheless I will still support Star Wars and hopefully they improve that on the next installment.","true":true}
