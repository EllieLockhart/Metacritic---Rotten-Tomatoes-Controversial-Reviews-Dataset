Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, a great movie and a great Star Wars film. Maybe slightly too much humor in some scenes; could have dialed it back a little to propel the narrative forward. Some levity = good\\, too much = distracting. Still\\, Rian Johnson did a great job and this answered many questions\\, added new ones\\, and disregarded stories that didn't really matter in the end. Bring on Episode IX!","true":true}
