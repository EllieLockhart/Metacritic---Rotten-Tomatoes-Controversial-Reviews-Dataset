Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's Star Wars\\, but not by much. Better to rename this Star Chase\\, Star Theories\\, or Star Debates.  The most heroic moments of this film are ruined by ill timed humor and contradictory philosophy. The fatalism of the Force has reached a whole new level.  The films central story is punctuated by a 20 minute vignette that carries absolutely no weight to the franchise or even the film itself.","true":true}
