Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want you to know that I am a liberal\\, progressive\\, socialist and I hate this film!  It ruins the STAR WARS franchise by completely mishandling the character of Luke Skywalker.  Luke Skywalker would not have tried to kill Han and Leia's child in his sleep.  Luke Skywalker is my childhood hero (as far as movies go).  He wouldn't even have been on that island!  He would have been right next to his sister and Han who would have all never given up!\\n\\nThis film is a failure and a disappointment and it is important for you to know that the reason for my hatred is not sexism.  I have always welcomed women and minorities in movies.  Have a nice day!","true":true}
