{"101487":180810,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film\\, at best\\, is a bizarre disappointment; at worst\\, it is an abysmal failure.  There are actually too many things to critique that I don't know where to start.  May be the fact that Finn and Rose's subplot is a pointless\\, half-baked\\, P.C. waste of time that has neither substance nor consequence; or maybe the fact that all the men are losers: Luke\\, a cantankerous recluse\\, Po\\, an impertinent fool who needs to learn a \\\"tough lesson\\,\\\" Finn\\, who cannot even succeed at dying for others.  Ben Solo had some good moments thanks to Adam Driver's excellent acting\\, but his flip-flop conflict was a bit drawn out.\\n\\nThis movie also felt very preachy. Plutocracy is bad\\, arm dealers are the greedy 1% . . . sure\\, but why is this part of a Star Wars movie! Save it for a college classroom!  Not to mention the final message of Rose: We really win by loving one another instead of fighting our enemies.  What a false dichotomy!  This movie is called Star WARS . . it could have been called Star RETREATS.  The one offensive was in the opening film . . . an attack for which Po is harshly rebuked by Leia.  Every other engagement is called off\\, abandoned\\, or taken up by a force phantom.\\n\\nSpeaking of force phantoms\\, what an ending: Don't worry everyone\\, Luke didn't die! Yay!  . . . (30 seconds later) . . . oh . . . wait . . . he died\\, nevermind. Well\\, at least he didn't die fighting! That would have gone against our message.  Luke died . . . I died\\, when I saw him being suckled by the Loch Ness monster.\\n\\nAll the mysteries and loose ends came to nothing: Rey's parents are nobodies\\, Snoke dies and it never explains his backstory or how he seduced Ben Solo\\, the knights of Ren are passed over\\, etc.  \\n\\nI could go on\\, but what is the point! Critics who praised this movie not only do not know Star Wars\\, they do not know good film-making! It is depressing enough that they want to distance this saga from the Skywalker family.  But more than this\\, The Last Jedi is not a well-made film.  The plot\\, the character arcs\\, the dialogue . . . little of it is on point.  \\\"Help us JJ Abrams . . . you're our only hope!\\\"","true":true}
