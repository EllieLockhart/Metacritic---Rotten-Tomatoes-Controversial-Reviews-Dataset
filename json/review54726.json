Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I sat through this film. I wasn't bored and I didn't leave. But when it ended I felt an increasing sense of disillusionment. Why all the jokey stuff? Humour between the characters has always been there in SW\\, but it felt this was slapstick to the camera. The code breaker arc seemed pointless\\, the power politics on the cruiser contrived. Many of the characters\\, new and old\\, didn't feel believable. The entire Snokes scene was such a rip of the Luke-Vader-Emperor scene that I cringed. It's hard to summarise what the core problem was but overall I felt that the actors were 'playing at star wars' instead of really being their characters. I've read a lot of tosh claiming that people like me didn't like it because of the powerful female characters. Oh come on! I have two daughters. I am DELIGHTED to see strong female lead characters. This film ended the SW love affair for me and I don't expect I will see the next one. It ended\\, not with a bang but a whimper.","true":true}
