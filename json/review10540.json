Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great tone\\, spectacular visually and the plot was not too bad!  I'd question some of the character motivations but that is minor for a movie like this.  Plus it gets back to more philosophical questions.  Enjoyed it a lot.","true":true}
