Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't know where to begin. It took a while to sink in\\, and I'm still processing what it was that I sat through today. It wasn't a Star Wars movie. I suppose the overarching thing was that I didn't feel like I was in the Star Wars universe that I am used to. I mean\\, there was a scene in this movie with people walking around in TUXEDO's for crying out loud. The villains were either buffoons or emo. They certainly weren't a real threat to anything. I could honestly go on and on and on. Not to be overly dramatic\\, but I feel like Star Wars was ruined for me today. The history and lore destroyed.  I might as well have sat through an Avengers movie.","true":true}
