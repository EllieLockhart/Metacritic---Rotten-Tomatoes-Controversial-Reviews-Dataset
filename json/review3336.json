Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being an avid Star Wars fan I had tickets for 3 showings in the first 36 hours of release - starting off with The Force Awakens + TLJ double bill. As midnight approached and post TFA we were beyond excited. The Star Wars music hits\\, the crawl sets the scene and into the first scene we go. Brilliant so far then the Hux \/ Poe banter was a bit weird being so early in the movie but ok we carry on\\, not a big problem. First scene over and I'm loving it\\, cut to Luke and Rey here we go . . . . and as Luke throws the lightsaber away I was distraught. No\\, please don't do this Disney\\, don't make a mockery of what Lucas established all them years ago. Unfortunately it went from bad to worse.\\nFloating space Leia is stupid and an insult to any form of intelligence.\\nWhy can't the First Order catch up with the Mon Cal ship? Can't they do a mini-hyperspace jump? Again\\, stupid.\\nWhat REALLY was the point of the Rose and Finn story\\, it seems so latched on its incredible. It was pointless in the end.\\nDJ's character is just Flloyd from True Romance in space and why was he such a secret\\, awful storytelling also did him no justice.\\nHow did BB-8 end up in an AT-ST. That can run. And peels like an Orange.\\nHow can we cut between the Rey story where she appears to be on an island training for days keep interacting with Kylo whose story is taking place over hours!?!?! WTF!! Have we all gone dumb?\\nThe Mary Poppins street urchins where more cringe-worthy of anything from the Prequels.\\nHow many times did Disney try to jedi mind trick us with \\\"forget the past\\, look to the future.\\\"\\nSnoke was in the end pointless\\, lol\\, he's so powerful but fell for that death from Kylo (Adam Driver was very good to be fair it was just the bland story).\\nPhasma again wasted and obviously just there to sell cool looking toys.\\nRey is after all a nobody.\\nThe cow creature boobs were too much!\\nAdam Drivers boobs were far too much!!\\nI could go on and on\\, its just diabolical.\\n\\nWhere has peoples critical thinking gone? It just goes to show the so called critics these days are afraid of the powerhouses such as Disney.\\nUnbelievable! \\n93%!!! 8\/10 bwahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!\\nFingers crossed JJ has the skill to craft his own movie from this but I doubt it.\\nShambles.","true":true}
