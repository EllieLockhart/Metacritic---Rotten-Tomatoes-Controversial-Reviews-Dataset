Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie wasn't perfect but it was still fantastic. Definitely the top movie outside of the original trilogy\\, probably better than Return of the Jedi\\, maybe even better than Star Wars or Empire. Plot was interesting\\, the fight scenes were top notch\\, and the acting was phenomenal.","true":true}
