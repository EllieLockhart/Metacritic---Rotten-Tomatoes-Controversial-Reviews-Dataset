Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is honestly one of the worst star wars ever made. I still think Phantom Menace was the worst\\, just because the hype for a new star wars movie after 15 years of hiatus led to extremely high expectations\\, and the let down of Phantom Menace was unforgettable\\, unforgivable\\, and ultimately what cost Lucas his franchise. The Last Jedi was probably the 2nd worst in my opinion. The dialogue is horrid\\, and it makes good actors struggle\\, and bad actors unbearable to watch. There were a few laughable moments\\, but mostly I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of it all! Rian Johnson and the rest should be sh*t canned\\, just like this movie.","true":true}
