Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel that people are often compelled to respond when they don't like something\\, I was compelled to respond because I loved something. This movie gave me everything I wanted in a Star Wars installment and more. I have found many of the complaints filed to be\\, in my opinion\\, unfounded. This was an epic tale that took place seamlessly across multiple planets and locations. It was\\, for the Star Wars universe\\, a truly original and thoughtful story that paid homage to the past while wrestling with its relevance. I feel like the force has been defined in the best and most wondrous way . The emotional journey wrapped me up and pulled me through this epic tale. I will be seeing it again... and again. It takes a lot for a movie to make me so reflective in my own life\\, this will go down as one of my favorite stories of all time. The symbols\\, the characters\\, and the mounting uncertainty; I feel like the Star Wars universe is in great hands and moving toward something even greater.","true":true}
