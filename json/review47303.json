Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a train wreck of a movie. I am truly disappointed with TLJ. I am from the original generation of SW fans. I understand that SW cannot always revolve around Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia. I know the generation gap needs to be bridged and new characters must be introduced. I admire the new generation of heroes\\, Rey\\, Finn and Poe. Even amongst criticism\\, I enjoyed TFA and considered it to be a great opportunity to introduce new characters and storylines. However\\, after watching TLJ\\, I'm beginning to have second thoughts. Prior to TLJ\\, I had no idea who Rian Johnson was. Well\\, I do now! If this person has anything to do with future SW projects you can count me out. He has effectively ruined the legacy of Luke Skywalker and quite possibly the entire franchise.","true":true}
