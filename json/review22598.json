Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LFL is paying people to boost this RT rating.  DON'T BE FOOLED.  The Last Jedi is a poorly written film.  Yes\\, the FX are great as usual\\, but the story is stupid and doesn't follow the previous movie at all.  And Luke Skywalker's character is totally trashed--turned into a deadbeat loser instead of the hero we all know and love.  People hate this movie for good reason.  AVOID.","true":true}
