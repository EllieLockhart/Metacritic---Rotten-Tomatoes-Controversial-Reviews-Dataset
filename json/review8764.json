Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Force Awakens ended with all these wonderful questions that kept Star Wars fans eagerly waiting for answers. The answers we got were underwhelming or not answered at all. Who\/where Snoke came from? How he even became the leader of the remnants of the Empire. Knights or Ren? And then there is Luke who goes to kill Ben in his sleep? The same guy that found a glimmer of light in Vader? \\\"I can't bring him back.\\\" and Leia ... \\\"My son is gone\\\". Very contradictory for those characters. It feels like this movie goes out of its way to do the opposite of what you would think just to keep people guessing\\, and the result really leaves me unhopeful for future movies and not interested in the new Characters. Kylo could have been great\\, but he is now a main villain that doesn't really strike any fear in me. Ray was also potentially great ... now though\\, STILL an untrained Force User with no backstory to speak of to explain why she's able to show the power she does. I feel really bad for Mark Hamill.","true":true}
