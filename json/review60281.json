We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"THIS GAME IS A MASTERPIECE\\, I mean i don\u2019t know what to say really\\, the game is as close to perfect in my eyes\\, the story arc and just character development is A1\\, mainly because at the start of the game i wanted to see Abby get killed just as much as the next guy\\, but i never would of thought but by the end i felt sorry for her\\, she lost her dad to Joel\\, that is enough reason to go after him\\, let alone him being the reason the vaccine will never be created. She lost all of her friends\\, she lost everything\\, except for Lev. Surely thats worse than death. I also think the end of Ellie\u2019s story was heartbreaking but perfect\\, there\u2019s still hope for her imo\\, she learned that at times you gotta learn to not let your emotions get the best of you\\, to me and the end she\u2019s going back to Jackson to possibly fix her relationship with Tommy\\, Dina etc. but thats me thinking positively\\, we\u2019ll see if they do a part III. Also the gameplay is **** great\\, that **** is brutal and i love it\\, graphics are obviously incredible\\, cant wait for multiplayer\\, whenever that comes out. Overall its literally a perfect sequel\\, not quite as good at the original\\, but its so damn close.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
