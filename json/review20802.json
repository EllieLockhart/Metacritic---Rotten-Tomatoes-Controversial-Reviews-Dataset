Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to really like this but my god.....I never thought I would say it but there is a Star Wars movie worse than The Phantom Menace. Disney has basically just crapped all over the originals and the prequels with this movie. No wonder Mark Hamill looked so depressed in every interview. They totally destroyed Luke in this film. The Mouse must have been giving away sheckles like they were candy in order for RT and all the critics to say this movie is sooooo good. What a joke. Never wasting a dime on anything SW related again\\, it really did die a long time ago.","true":true}
