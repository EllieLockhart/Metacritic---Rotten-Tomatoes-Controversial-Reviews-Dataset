Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In top 5 of worse films. Plot holes the size of a dreadnought. The poor acting and the plot could possibly be forgivable if this movie didn't also suffer from the unforgivable sin: it was boring. I kept looking at the time wondering how much longer we had to go.","true":true}
