Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've already seen it. Loved it! Nice bridge of the old story line to new possible story lines. Loved the growth of Adam Driver emerging as Kylo Ren. Loved the dynamic between Rey and Kylo. Liked everything about it. Loved the sub story line between Finn and Rose - the message was great.","true":true}
