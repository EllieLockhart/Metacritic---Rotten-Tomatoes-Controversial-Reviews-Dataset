Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was given a solid layup by JJ Abrams in the previous film just to intentionally brick the shot and kill off everything people loved about Star Wars in addition to relegating the newly added character to 40 minutes of inconsequential fetch questing and virtue signaling.  Not looking forward to the next one and anyone who accuses \\\"haters\\\" of being racist\/misogynistic should be ashamed all the way up to the point they plunk down $18.99 for a \\\"Porg Plushie\\\" at their local Disney Store.","true":true}
