Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disappointment through and through.  No questions answered\\, no secrets revealed\\, just a poorly conceived \\\"plot\\\" centering around Emo Vader and Angry Girl and their ability Force Flirt from light years away.\\n\\nNo spoilers here\\, but\\, seriously? Space is a vacuum. Ugh.\\n\\nI've seen better film on teeth.","true":true}
