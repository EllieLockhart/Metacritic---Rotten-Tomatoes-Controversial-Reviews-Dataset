Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From a middle-aged Star Wars fanboy...please ignore those other middle-aged fanboys whose hearts are broken because Luke is portrayed as a human being with flaws. No\\, Luke is not the new Yoda\\, Snoke is not the new Emperor\\, the Force is more than a biological quirk\\, and Porgs are not the new Ewoks. The world is a dynamic place\\, and life takes surprising twists and turns. This movie reflects that reality\\, and tells a compelling story at the same time. Reading the reviews from people who were 'let down' by this movie are the same type of people who were let down by The Beatles when they released Sgt Peppers. The good news is that those people can return to their mom's basement and enjoy The Empire Strikes Back ad nauseam over the holidays. The rest of us will go see this amazing production again\\, and discover more reasons why this is exactly the story that was needed to re-energize this franchise.","true":true}
