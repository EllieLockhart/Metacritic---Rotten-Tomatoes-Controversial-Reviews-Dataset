Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a shame. they made a mockery of star wars. Luke as the comic relief? what the hell? first star wars movie I wanted to get my money back. it's a slap in the face to all true starwars fans. want my money back. ","true":true}
