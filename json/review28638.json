Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros\\nGood special effects \\nCons\\nBad writing and plot holes galore. This movie only works because it assumes both sides are stupid. The first order doesn't fire on ships when told to in the opening scene. They don't cut off the escape route of the rebellion by firing upon the ship with all the life forms .. no they fire on\\nAn empty base\\n\\nA music score that is unremarkable. You won't be humming any of this\\n\\nUnderwhelming characters. Rey can do anything without training. Finn is surprised there is a tracker but doesn't remember this even though he remember mopping the place? Poe get torn down for making the right decisions?  The movie renders  technological terrors mute by weaponzing lightspeed; what's the point of Death Star\\, starkiller bases or dreadnuaghts when you can add ftl to an asteroid and really don't care if someone destroys it.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor\\, don't pay to see this. Wait until\\nIt comes to a streaming platform","true":true}
