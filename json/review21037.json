Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was pretty worried going into this move\\, honestly\\, because episode seven\\, as much as I genuinely enjoyed it\\, was just a re-hashing of episode four. But VIII managed to defy my expectations and genuinely be enjoyable. I was far anyway from being invested in Kylo at the end of episode VII but this film gave he and Luke a depth and complication I was not expecting but thoroughly enjoyed and am invested in seeing how their mistakes pan out. Rey was a breath of fresh air\\, as she was also given so much more depth than in VII. All the characters were especially\\, Finn\\, Poe and Rose and it was wonderful to see a galaxy that is far more inlcusive. Things never happen the same way twice\\, and I think that's a lesson everyone needs to take to heart both from this movie and about this movie.","true":true}
