Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible attempt at making a Star Wars film as a whole. The director actually made it seem like he hated everything Star Wars was about before on a personal level and purposely sought out to make a movie that insulted all of the previous installments of the franchise. Save your money on this one. It's not even worth Redbox honestly.","true":true}
