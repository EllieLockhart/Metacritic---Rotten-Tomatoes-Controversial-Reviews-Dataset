Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was awesome\u203c\ufe0f I know some people hate it cause of the direction but I enjoyed it and have been a Star Wars fan since I was 7 I\u2019m glad Ryan the director didn\u2019t just make us assume was was going to happen but surprised us. Can\u2019t wait for the next one\u2728","true":true}
