{"101487":118746,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-10","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even though I have already posted a review of the movie\\, some of the hypocritical\\, tone-deaf arguments on this site against The Last Jedi have gotten out of hand and reveal a blatant double-standard in the criticisms being leveled against the film.  Someone reading these reviews with little or no knowledge of the Star Wars movies would walk away believing that the prior films were air-tight masterworks of storytelling\\, tone\\, and world-building.  Perfect masterpieces that never contradicted themselves or left the viewer with any questions.  While I love the Star Wars cinematic universe\\, I am not going to blindly put the prior films on a pedestal and judge the new one with a higher or different standard than the others.   I realize that this a review site and not really the place for this sort of thing but far too many people are using this medium as a vehicle for their own personal vendetta rather than rationally reviewing the movie.   If you didn't like it\\, that's fine.  I completely respect that.  What I don't respect are baseless claims\\, poor arguments and unjust comparisons.  My original review is at the end.\\n\\nBAD ARGUMENT #1 - \\\"The movie didn't give me any information or backstory about X\\,Y\\, Z (Kylo Ren's fall to the dark side\\, Knights of Ren\\, Snoke\\, First Order\\, New Republic\\, etc.)\\nThe lore of Star Wars\\, like it or not\\, has long been a combination of the what is presented in the movies and information from \\\"outside\\\" sources.  Books\\, guides\\, comics\\, games\\, etc.   If you love the lore\\, you can go deeper by exploring things presented outside the movies.   \\n\\nLet me ask you a few questions.  Using ONLY the original movies can you explain the following:\\n\\n-What was the Jedi Order like?\\n\\n-Who were the Sith?  (This word is never even mentioned in the original movies)\\n\\n-What was the Emperor's name?\\n\\n-What was the  Republic prior to the Empire like?\\n\\n-How big was the Empire?  (doesn't seem very big if you just go by the movies)\\n\\n-What could a fully trained Jedi Master do?\\n\\n-Who was that red-haired lady that shows up all of a sudden in Return of the Jedi and seems to be the leader of the Rebellion?  (No background\\, no name at all in the movie)\\n\\n-How did Luke become so capable as a force user between Empire and Return of the Jedi?\\n\\n-How did he build his own lightsaber?\\n\\nThis list could go on and on but the point is clear.   Are you really going to claim that The Last Jedi made some egregious error by not spelling everything out for us or revealing every little detail about people\\, groups\\, or concepts presented in the movie (especially the SECOND movie of a three part trilogy)?    If you are upset\\, you can do what we did with the original trilogy.   Either use your imagination\\, look for information outside the movie or...just wait.    Think about it this way\\, if someone was wanting to understand what the Jedi Order was like or who the Emperor really was\\, and they never went outside the movies for any information\\, they had to wait 16 years for that knowledge.\\n\\nBAD ARGUMENT #2 - \\\"The Last Jedi contradicted everything that came before and ruined the continuity of Star Wars\\\"\\n\\nOne question...how?   Please explain how it contradicted anything that happened before.  And if you have a reason\\, please explain how this is a problem unique to The Last Jedi in the Star Wars films.  If you want to talk continuity problems\\, look no further than the original trilogy versus the prequels.   Sometimes\\, the pieces just don't fit the way they are supposed to.   Some examples:\\n\\n-Obi-Wan's description of Anakin to Luke in A New Hope versus the \\\"reality\\\" that we saw presented in the prequels\\n\\n-Luke having the name \\\"Skywalker\\\" even though he was supposed to be kept hidden \\n\\n-Lea\\, in Return of the Jedi\\, remembering her \\\"real\\\" mother versus what we saw in the prequels\\n\\n-The Jedi seeming \\\"legendary\\\" or something from a far earlier time even though the events of the prequels took place about 19-20 years before.  (Obi-Wan must have aged badly as well when you look at those time frames)\\n\\nAgain\\, the list could go on.   In what way does the Last Jedi contradict or create continuity problems?  If your answer is \\\"weaponized hyperspace\\\" then please see BAD AGRUMENTS #1.  Sometimes how things work in Star Wars is revealed outside the movies or much later.   Whatever the case may be\\, it is completely tone-deaf to hold The Last Jedi to some \\\"higher\\\" critical review than the previous films.\\n\\nI would contend that the Last Jedi does a better job at preserving story continuity than the previous installments and connects the ideas and concepts presented in the prequels in a more logical way.  Luke's discussion and analysis with Rey about the pride and arrogance of the Jedi Order and the rise of Darth Sidious retroactively makes the prequels far more interesting than what they were before.  \\n\\nThe movie even gives us some nuanced thematic imagery that connects with the prequels but cleverly adds different layers of meaning.   There is a scene toward the end that shows Kylo Ren marching into the Rebel base with a contingent of stormtroopers that recalls the sequence in Revenge of the Sith were Anakin was marching into the Jedi Temple.   However\\, whereas Anakin was a newly created pawn of Palpatine\\, Kylo Ren has just killed his puppet-master and walks in as his own \\\"master\\\".   He accomplished what his grandfather never did.  He finished what he started  as he said he wanted to do in the \\\"Force Awakens\\\".\\n\\nSpeaking of the Force Awakens.  Many people are complaining that The Last Jedi fails to follow through with all of the mystery boxes presented in the previous movie.   Two things:  See BAD ARGUMENT #1 and\/or accept the fact that some of the reveals (such as Rey's lineage) just wasn't the answer you wanted.   The movie didn't fail to give some answers it just answered them in a way that you didn't like.\\n\\nIn fact\\, I would contend that there is a tighter continuity between the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi than there are between the movies of the Original Trilogy.  In the Force Awakens\\, Maz Kanata literally tells Rey that her parents are not coming back\\, that she should know this.  Basically hinting to the audience the truth that is revealed about her parents in the Last Jedi.\\n\\nHan tells Rey and Finn that\\, after Kylo destroyed Luke's academy\\, Luke walked away from everything.   The audience should have expected to see the broken Luke that was hinted at in The Force Awakens.  \\n\\nWhere are the continuity problems?  How did The Last Jedi change anything that was established in The Force Awakens?\\n\\nCompare this with the original trilogy.  Did Lucas really plan for Leia to be Luke's sister from the beginning?  Based on the movies\\, this doesn't seem likely.  Vader to Leia in \\\"A New Hope\\\":  \\\"You are part of the rebel alliance and a trait...wait a minute...I am getting a feeling about you\\\"  Please.  The infamous kiss in Empire?  The reveal that Leia was Luke's sister causes more continuity issues than anything presented in The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi.  \\n\\nBAD ARGUMENT #3 - \\\"Men Bad\\, Women Good\\\"\\n\\nI have already addressed this in my earlier review but I will repost what I said here:\\n\\n\\\" I would like to offer a rebuttal against some of the criticisms suggesting that the Last Jedi was merely a feminist hit piece against  masculinity. Although\\, I understand how someone can try to make that claim\\,  bear in mind that \\, toward the end of movie\\, Leia when asked for guidance by the surviving resistance points to Poe and says \\\"follow him\\\".  I don't believe that this was an attack on masculinity but a lesson on wisdom versus recklessness and what it takes to be a competent leader.  Remember that in Empire Strikes Back\\, Yoda had the same lesson for Luke (\\\"You are reckless\\\").  He wasn't attacking Luke's masculinity but his immaturity.   This lesson\\, whether it comes from a female character or a little green puppet\\, is a timeless one.  \\nNot only that\\, but for all of the people crying \\\"Feminist Propaganda\\\"\\, let's not forget that is a male character that saves Rey from Snoke and it is a male character that saves EVERYONE at the end.  The whole \\\"feminist propaganda\\\"\\, \\\"men are worthless in this movie\\\" arguments are overblown and vastly overstated.\\n\\nPlease bear in mind that the female characters are not perfect either.  Rey\\, while accused of being a Mary Sue with no character flaws\\, screws up in a big way by not heeding Luke's advice and recklessly flying off like he did in Empire.\\n\\nPurple-hair lady also screws up by not letting Poe know about her plan and a lot of lives are lost.  Stop with the Feminist propaganda arguments...they are getting old and tired.\\n\\nBAD ARGUMENT #4 - \\\"Not MY Luke\\\"\\, \\\"Luke would NEVER do X\\, Y\\, Z\\\"\\n\\nLet's face facts.  It was never your Luke.  It was never my Luke.  The character of Luke Skywalker is what the writers have determined him to be.  You can like it or not\\, that's fine but the character doesn't belong to you or to me.  \\n\\nHere is what I wrote in my previous review:\\n\\\"Let's talk about Luke since this seems to be one of the main reasons that people are disliking the movie.  As I said above\\, initially\\, I was right there with everyone.  I thought they utterly screwed up his character and I was pissed.  So pissed in fact\\, that I made account on review sites\\, trashed the move and signed a dumb petition.  But I was wrong.  Think about it this way..  Who hasn't contemplated what they would do if they could go back in time and kill Hitler before he rose to power.  That's the dilemma that Luke was facing.   It's not\\, as some jokingly suggest\\, that he sensed a little bit of darkness in Ben and decided to go full-on murder spree. Sure\\, this is the man who sacrificed everything to save his father.  This is also the man who\\, for the duration of the OT trusted his instincts (They \\\"served him well\\\").  In that moment\\, he saw what Kylo would become.  A tyrant that would undo everything that he and his friends fought and lost so much for.  Someone that could plunge the galaxy into a new dictatorship\\, killing millions and bringing darkness.  For one second\\, his instincts told him to strike him down.  But you know what?  This is a wiser Luke\\, still human and flawed but someone who now knows that following \\\"feelings\\\" isn't always the best course of action.  You need wisdom and patience.  He might have thought about it for one second but that second passes.  Is this really out of character or does it show a very nuanced character growth?  For me\\, after thinking it through\\, it shows the latter.\\n\\nSome people had a problem with Luke not showing up in person to defend the resistance against the First Order.  First\\, I don't think he could\\, his X-wing seemed to be beyond repair at the point but\\, more importantly\\, what he did reflected the wisdom of a Jedi Master.   If he showed up\\, one of two things would have happened.  He would have either killed Kylo Ren robbing him of any redemption or he would have been struck down\\, robbing the resistance of any remaining hope that they had.  By projecting himself\\, across the galaxy\\, he not only showed himself to be the most powerful force user that we have ever seen\\, he also became something more than a man. He became a symbol and a legendary hero.  Is that really a bad way to end Luke's journey?\\\"\\n\\n#5 RANDOM BAD ARGUMENTS IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER\\n\\n\\\"My best friend is dead and I don't care\\\"\\n\\nSome people are upset that The Last Jedi doesn't spell out for the audience Luke's reaction to Han Solo's death. However\\,  I think this is a perfect example of the old cliche \\\"less is more\\\".   Did the movie really need to spell this out for you?  Everything we needed to see occurred when Luke was in the cockpit of the Falcon\\, running his hand over the instruments and holding Han's dice.  Honestly\\, what more do you want?  15 minutes of Luke breaking down and recalling all of the good times?  The scene was subtle\\, nuanced and\\, because of its quality\\, carried more far more emotional weight.\\n\\n\\\"Animals Good\\, Forget the Slave Kids\\\"\\n\\nWhile I am not a fan of the Canto Bight sequence (I thought it was too long and not very interesting)\\, this particular argument is a bit baffling to me.   What did you expect Finn and Rose to do?  Take the kids into a war-zone where there was a high probability of them becoming space-dust?  Thanks rescuers!\\n\\n\\\"Is Fuel Really A Thing Now?\\\"\\n\\nIn a New Hope\\, prior to the Death Star assault\\, you literally saw X-Wings getting fueled up. So\\, yes\\, fuel (whatever it is) is a thing in the Star Wars universe that ships use.\\n\\n\\\"Nothing the Resistance did in Force Awakens matters in The Last Jedi\\\"\\n\\nSee BAD ARGUMENT #1.  Also\\, did you feel the same way at the start of Empire?  It seemed the rebels won at the end of a New Hope but that wasn't the case.  The First Order\\, Like the Empire is much larger than we thought.   Plus\\, it literally says in the first line of opening crawl that the \\\"First Order Reigns\\\".  So\\, yeah\\, they were a bigger organization than the Starkiller base.\\n\\n\\\"What...we have BOOK BURNING Now?\\\"\\n\\nRey has the books.  They were not burned and we see them being stowed away in the Falcon at the end.  Did you see Luke's reaction when Yoda burned the tree?  Yoda\\, again\\, was teaching him a lesson.  He knew the books were safely away.\\n\\n\\\"Force Ghosts can use affect the world...what?\\\"\\n\\nSee BAD AGRUMENT #1.  I don't know...maybe this is a thing that can be done by a Jedi Master\\, in the most sacred place on the world where the Jedi Order began? Do you think that maybe the location they were at had anything to do with Yoda being able to manifest this ability?  I don't think this causes any problems or plot-holes.\\n\\n\\\"But\\, but...Luke left a map! If he didn't want to be found then what the hell?\\\"\\n\\nWrong.  They found the map that he was using to find the planet with the first Jedi temple.  They found the thing Luke was looking for.  It never states anywhere that he specifically left the map for people to find him.   No plot-hole or continuity issue here.\\n\\n\\\"This movie is for kids\\, not for thinking people\\\"\\n\\nMaybe you just weren't paying any attention.  Maybe you were just too hung up on your assumptions and preconceived notions to follow the themes and nuances.  Admittedly\\, I was the first time I watched it.  \\n\\n\\\"Disney\/Rian Johnson are INTENTIONALLY ruining Star Wars. They Hate it!\\\"\\n\\nWhile I am no Disney apologist\\, let's think this through.   Disney spent BILLIONS on the purchase of the franchise plus the millions of dollars spent in making the movies PLUS creating a Star Wars themed section of their park JUST to maniacally and purposefully tear it all down with the release of Last Jedi.  Because\\, yeah\\, that makes sense.\\n\\n\\\"Mark Hamill got paid off to change his mind about the Luke storyline\\\"\\n\\n...or he just realized that it was a compelling and interesting direction after he saw the big picture. I don't know...like he said in interviews.   I guess anyone who likes the movie (critics\\, Hamill\\, reviewers) are part of some vast conspiracy and are Disney paid shills.\\n\\n\\\"Lea flying through space was dumb\\\" \\n\\nI didn't like that scene either.\\n\\nThere is much more that could be said.  I will not take the time to address all the SUBJECTIVE arguments that are being put forward.  (Is Rey a Mary Sue\\, Is Kylo Ren a compelling villain\\, etc. etc.) Some things worked for some people\\, some things didn't but I don't think they are strong enough to push this movie into the \\\"rotten\\\" territory of the review range.   I will just close with what I wrote in my previous review:\\n\\n\\\"This movie\\, while having some problems with tone and pacing\\, doesn't deserve the level of vitriol being thrown against it.  Admittedly\\, I understand.  For awhile I was right there with everyone who is posting negative reviews.  I even created an account and rated it low.  Like Mark Hamill\\, I initially fundamentally disagreed with the direction that took Luke's character.  But then I saw it again and like Hamill\\, I appreciated the nuance and development that was expressed.  It took a second viewing to understand what this movie did right and what it was trying to do.  This comes from a life long Star Wars fan.  I feel bad that I initially trashed it.  Watch it again and your perception may change. As I said\\, I disagree with some of the pacing and storyline decisions (purple hair\\, Canto Bight\\, some politicizing and Rose saving Finn I am looking at you) but this movie actually does a lot of things right and cleans the slate for the Star Wars universe to go in any direction.  We don't have a Vader clone in Kylo Ren\\, we don't have a carbon copy Palaptine.  We have a Skywalker that is a supreme commander and lowly woman from a backwater planet with no special lineage as the one standing against someone from a powerful bloodline. We have probably the best pilot we have seen in a Star Wars movie in Poe Dameron who is not an Antilles\/Solo copy\\, who goes from brash hothead to capable leader.  We have an immensely outgunned resistance in a small \\\"ark\\\" trying to carry the light of hope.  Sure\\, there were issues.  There are always issues in Star Wars movies and anyone that says otherwise is looking through rose-colored glasses. This was the most nuanced and deep Star Wars movie that has been released and\\, when the dust settles and tempers calm\\, may go down as being on par with Empire in the future.\\\"","true":true}
