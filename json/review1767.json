Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I was sure I would not just like\\, but love this movie. So I was surprised to find myself shaking my head and groaning whilst watching this movie.\\n\\nThe visuals are on par with what I expected\\, but the writing is just poor. At one point the main villain says he wants to kill the past\\, and that seems to be director Rian Johnsons vision too. If you share the same vision as the bad guy in real life\\, that usually don't lead to good things\\, as evidenced by this movie.\\n\\nHe killed everything I love about Star Wars\\, and in this reviewers eyes\\, he's the bad guy.","true":true}
