Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things that define this move: Infantile humor\\, plot holes\\, illustrating men are all hot-headed idiots while women are flawless and amazeballs. Superman Leia\\, wasted potential (Luke\\, Snoke\\, Admiral Ackbar\\, Leia)\\, No need to really train as a Jedi if you are the female lead\\, you can be super-powered in only three lessons. Useless side-missions to insert\/highlight diversity character\\, BB-8 to the rescue (the Chicken Walker First Order AT-ST scene is horrible) over and over\\, and on\\, and on\\, and on.\\n\\nEven though several of the actors did a great job\\, the special effects\\, the new vehicles and technology was very cool. and pacing of some of the battles was great\\, it could not make up for the flaws from the first paragraph.\\n\\nDisney - Stop writing scripts based on checking boxes and start trying to write great stories.","true":true}
