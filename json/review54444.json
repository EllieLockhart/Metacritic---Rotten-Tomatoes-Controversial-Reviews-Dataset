Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll join the chorus of voices asking where the 92% positive critic score comes from.  This movie is aimed toward the children's and teen market - I'm happy to say it was met with a resounding 'meh' by my 12 year old.  Disjointed and derivative\\, often pointless plot lines\\, and characters inserted with the clear objective of introducing a new line of figurines.  Clumsy and transparent attempts at pushing a social agenda added a further distraction. I suffered through the full length of this overly long movie only because I'd accompanied a minor.  Turns out he wanted to leave early too.","true":true}
