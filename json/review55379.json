Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie!! forget all of the fan theory's you have read and watch this with an open mind. \\n\\nQuoting what Luke says In the Trailer \\n\\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\"\\n\\nYou could also take a quote from the Marvel Movie Doctor Strange when Mordo says\\n\\\"Forget Everything you think you know.\\\"\\n\\n It Is different from the original trilogy\\, which makes it great! Johnson does a great job of keeping Star Wars fun. Many people were worried that this movie would copy Empire. Although it is Similar in some sense\\, the story is overall original. This film takes points from all three of the original movies. Although like Empire\\, there is a incredibly shocking event that caught me really off guard. Luke Skywalkers return is epic and he does an amazing job. The Porgs are fun little creatures that have nothing to do with the story\\, but add a little bit of humor to the show.\\nRey\\, Finn\\, and all the other returning characters are great as well.\\nI've talked to many people that have seen this movie. Not one person I have talked too disliked the movie. With that being said\\, is made to excited the younger generation about Star Wars. It is definitely worth seeing in Theaters. Watching it in 3D was Awesome!! \\nWatch it with an open mind and you will enjoy it.","true":true}
