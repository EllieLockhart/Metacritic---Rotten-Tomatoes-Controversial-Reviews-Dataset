Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was an epic\\, emotional film with serious depth\\, excellent acting\\, good humor\\, great action and was visually stunning. Some of Rian Johnson's shots & scenes were nearly perfect and breathtaking.\\n\\nThere were several points throughout the movie where I gasped\\, or held my breath and even shed a tear. Mark Hamill deserves an Oscar Nomination period!  The take away for this is \\\"Hope from Hopelessness.\\\"\\n\\nLoved it in every measure\\, behind ESB\\, ANH\\, & Rogue One for me\\, slightly ahead of ROTJ.  I will be seeing it again soon!","true":true}
