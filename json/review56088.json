Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"some really bad scenes which ruin the immersion\\, one scene with Leila was awful. some force poor seem a bit over the top now. no significant character development and an investment in plot lines I don't really care for. to put this into perspective I liked the prequels.","true":true}
