Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as if Disney held a grudge against Lucas for holding out as long as he did and decided to kill everything that made Star Wars great and make a ton of money doing it. The message in the movie was literally killing the past and letting go of it. It was a spit in the face of the fans.","true":true}
