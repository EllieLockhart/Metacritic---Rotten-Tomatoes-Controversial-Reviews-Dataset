Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though there were definitely risks taken in this film sure to polarize some fans\\, I believe the move expanded on the universe in a meaningful way and helped pave the way for future star wars stories. Where I felt The Force Awakens was largely a retelling of A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi felt original enough\\, yet had enough hidden lore to please the fans of the expanded lore. Most of the polarizing views you see are from people expecting this movie to be a retelling of Empire Strikes Back. For me however\\, I am ecstatic that it wasn't.  \\n\\nSome moments were a bit drug out and there were cheesy moments as all star wars films have\\, but overall the film has quickly ascended to be one of my favorite star wars movies.","true":true}
