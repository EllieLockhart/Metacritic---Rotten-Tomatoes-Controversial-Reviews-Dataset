Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Funny\\,  familiar but different\\,  and every time you think you are done it keeps going.  All the supposed fans that don't like it\\,  WTF?  Guess what\\, the biggest problem with Star Wars these days is all the people who think they know what a Star Wars movie should be or that they would know if Star Wars was done\\\"right\\\".  Get over yourself.  Every single one of these movies\\, yes even the prequels\\, has something I like.  I can sit there and watch every single one of them.  Some I like better\\, to be sure.   But to say you are a fan and to then constantly complain about how they never get it right is high arrogance.","true":true}
