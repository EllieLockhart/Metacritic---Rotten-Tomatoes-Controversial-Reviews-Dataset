Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm here to bring the audience score for this movie up because honestly most of the hate this movie is getting is totally unwarranted. I saw The Last Jedi and it's definitely worth the watch. This film is super funny\\, intense\\, and action-packed from start to finish. It took everything I knew previously about Star Wars and threw it out\\, and unlike some people I don't see that as a bad thing. The acting was superb and the visuals were stunning. There were so many unexpected moments I'm still comprehending them as I write this. It's a film that takes bold risks\\, and I can see why some people don't like it but I think it's a step in the right direction to keep this franchise fresh and alive. I think this movie is great bravo Rian Johnson I can't wait to see how JJ wraps this up in 2019!","true":true}
