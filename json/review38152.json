Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The theme of learning from ones failures\\, and rising above them\\, persists throughout the whole film. It's a mythic tale about being true to yourself and a cautionary tale about living in the past. Our hero's come out of this movie knowing that there is hope\\, and that selflessness is stronger than anything. It's also one of the strongest entry's in the Star Wars cannon on a visual level. The fandoms dialogue around this movie truly cloud its merits\\, which is a shame\\, but understandable considering everyone personal expectations built up for their favorite characters beforehand.","true":true}
