Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is the First Order \/ Empire.  Massive disappointment and mismanagement of franchise with forced subplots to sell movies in Asia and sell new stuffed animals in stores.  This movie was unfocused\\, sloppy\\, and utterly disregards plot leads from Episode VII.  It was downright disrespectful of the Star Wars saga and established characters; not to mention less-than-candid in their tokenism (I don't know how else to describe what I saw).    \\n\\nIt's a damn shame and I hope J.J. Abrams can redeem this in Episode IX.","true":true}
