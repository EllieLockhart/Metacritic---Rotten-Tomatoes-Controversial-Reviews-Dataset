Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a star wars fan since i was very young. This movie was a sick abomination and shows that the director has way too much power. I had no problem when Disney took over\\, but I had a problem with this movie. I have read all the new canon books\\, played the new games\\, and read most of the comics\\, and i constantly stay updated on the lore and canon. I saw this movie on Thursday night\\, and I am still sick to my stomach about it. The director is trying to make his own mark for some reason\\, by stomping our favorite hero into the ground like he was just some simple character. Luke Skywalker was supposed to be the most powerful Jedi ever\\, now we will never get to see that thanks to Rian. Hopefully JJ Abrams can finish what Rian ruined\\, Rian deserves to never look at another Star Wars movie again\\, let alone direct one. (and for the people who say star wars fans dont like the new movies\\, i saw force awakens 6 times and rogue one 7 or 8 times.) I know a bad star wars movie when i see one. Luke Skywalker deserved better than this. Even Mark Hamill agrees. This one will hurt for awhile.","true":true}
