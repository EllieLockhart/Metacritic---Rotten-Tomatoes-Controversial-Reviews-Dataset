Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible way to end Luke's story. For 40 years I've waited to see Jedi Master Luke Skywalker kick some Sith ass. And all we get is a hologram distraction and a puff of smoke as he concentrated himself to death. Don't get me started on the waste of Leia. Oh *now* she decided to use the Force? Not to save someone or do something noble\\, but just to save her own ass? And Holdo couldn't just hit auto-pilot? Or hell\\, get 3PO to man the ship? Or an R2 unit? The casino run was a complete waste of space\\, and OMG what a waste of Benecio's talent. And Snoke? He can whip Rey's ass around the room like a rag doll\\, can connect Kylo and Rey's through Force Skype\\, but can't tell that Kylo is bullshitting him? Ugh. At least I can't just blame George Lucas for ruining Star Wars now. Thanks\\, Mickey.","true":true}
