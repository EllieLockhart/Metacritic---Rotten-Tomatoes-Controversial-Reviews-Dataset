Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man I really wanted this to improve on the last film\\, but it just tanked everything they set up. Some of the scenes were something like that of an acid dream. Why certain scenes played out the way they did just baffles me. The motivation for a LOT of the characters was just lacking. Some of the themes that they set up in the movie\\, i.e. the fact that there's more to the light side and dark side of the force; and they just drop it. By the end of the film all we are left with is the rebels are still rebels and Kylo is still evil\\, great.","true":true}
