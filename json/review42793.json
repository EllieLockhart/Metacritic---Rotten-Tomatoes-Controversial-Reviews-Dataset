Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was made for the hard core fans.  Gritty\\, sometimes funny with suspense and action.  Deeper dive into characters.  But the most astonishing thing I walked away with was\\, that while this was movie #2 in what  typically is a 3 movie segment\\, this movie left you in no doubt that they would not be able to wrap up everything in one more movie release.  I'm thinking it may be a never ending story now.","true":true}
