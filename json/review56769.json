Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new main characters are soulless and nonsensical\\, acquiring skills they shouldn't have out of nowhere and beating in fights characters who are supposed to have way better training and preparation than them just because \\\"they are the good guys and they must win\\\" destroying all the focus on training provided in the first 6 movies and that's bad enough but they managed to tear apart old characters such as Luke\\, Leia and han... oh my god Luke... look how they massacred my boy... \\nAn aspect of the movie that gets progressively old (Besides the never ending puns that would make a 4 year old cringe) is the excessive use of plot twists apparently used to make an unpredictable movie as a result of the director's confusion between the words unpredictable and good. A consequence of this idiotic goal of being unpredictable at any cost we get characters build up as absolutely crucial to the story like rey's parents and snook but end up being irrelevant to the plot and remain unexplained and unidimensional giving the audience a general sense of improvisation and lack of direction. \\nI'm not giving it half a star because of the movie itself being absolute crap because it's not\\, if you isolate the movie as an individual piece you can enjoy it (if you ignore the irrelevant characters and plot holes) specially considering the great visuals but sadly it's part of a franchise of movies and it's not all about the shinny fireworks for an audience that's not completely composed of childs and people who are watching Star Wars for the first time. So if you are a person who has watched the first 6 movies\\, Shares the idea of continuity and is not impressed only with good visuals you will see that episode 7 and 8 are not aligned with the Star Wars general essence and has serious plot holes\\, irrelevant characters and incoherences. \\n\\nIf you are a kid or you have never watched Star Wars before and you just wanna hang out and kill some time\\, go watch it\\, you got  nothing to loose except some money but I warn you that you are not gonna find your favorite movie today! \\nIf you actually like Star Wars\\, hardcore fan or casual\\, you go watch it anyways\\, If you can download it even better\\, it's Star Wars after all... apparently... but keep in mind that this movie will basically break all the rules and character development the previous 6 movies set up and that might kinda ruin a beloved franchise for you. \\nWarning: the puns and plot twists might drive you to suicide. Xoxo \\nPD: Mickey if you read this please make director Rian Johnson go away! He is not good for the franchise and that means it's not good for your pockets.","true":true}
