Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From start to finish a failure\\, written by someone who clearly hasn't seen all of the Starwars movie. The movie is filled with bland half fleshed characters and lead by Rey who is poorly written as ever in this nihilistic failure of a film. Mark Hamill's acting was the only redeeming quality this movie had. Unfortunately they completely mishandled Luke Skywalker (making him a coward) and did not give him a single action scene. This movie goes out of it's way to be actively insulting to it's own fan base\\, by far the worst entry in all of Starwars and generally one of the worst films I've ever seen.","true":true}
