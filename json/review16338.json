Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not understanding the vitriol many \u201cfans\u201d have expressed about this movie. I thought Rian Johnson breathed new life into the franchise. I thought \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d was exciting\\, funny and sexy. It will be interesting to see how J..J. Abrams concludes the trilogy.","true":true}
