Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is terrible. The following will contain spoilers so beware. \\n\\n\\n\\nFirst they just lifted a handful of elements from both empire and Jedi to create a weak story strung together with Mary Poppins Leia\\, a super strong and smart\\, yet weak and dumb Snoke that gets killed easier than Sean Bean in about anything. Benicio Del Toro shows up because Disney thinks he should be in every space franchise. The plot moves slower than molasses in Alaska in January. It also jumps around so much\\, so very much. The Jedi training was so weak and dumb. At least Empire gave us a rocky like training montage. IMDb and tomatoes rating it highly is shocking. It belongs with the prequels\\, quietly tucked away on a vga in the attic nevertheless to Be seen again.","true":true}
