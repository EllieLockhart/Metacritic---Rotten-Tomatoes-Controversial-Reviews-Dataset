Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally made and account so I could tell people how terribly disappointing this movie is. This movie is like your first serious relationship. You think that it's true love\\, that it's \\\"the one\\,\\\" and that it will never end. Over time\\, things slowly change. A new haircut\\, new clothes\\, new group of friends\\, etc. The changes are slow\\, incremental. Each change is only slight enough that you notice it\\, but the familiarity is still there. You have your fights\\, things are said\\, mistakes are made (killing Han)\\, but you are committed and you stick with it. Then\\, one day\\, you're in the middle of your routine and you realize that the relationship is over. Your significant other has changed so much that they are unrecognizable. That's what's happened here. On that note if you want a movie that is so \\\"extra \\\"\\nFor no reason look no further. It's an obvious attempt to change everyone's opinion what Star wars should be yet everyone realizes this is not a good movie although you want to love it deep down you leave disappointed","true":true}
