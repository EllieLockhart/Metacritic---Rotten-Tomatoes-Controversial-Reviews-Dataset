Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some people here want to use the original movies as a lens to judge the current ones. The original were the best\\, but these are also well told stories. These movies served as a means for me to introduce my wife to Star Wars. That they stand on their own without a need to know the previous movies while at the same time paying homage to the originals speaks to how good these movies are. If you liked 7 you\u2019ll like 8. It\u2019s like Empire to a New Hope. Dark but will an ever present hope. Ignore the sourpuss fan boy posts here and go enjoy a good movie. ","true":true}
