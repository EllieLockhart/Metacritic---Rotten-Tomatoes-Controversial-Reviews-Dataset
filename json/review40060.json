Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my least favorite Star Wars movie\\, and that includes the prequels. The good: it's texturally very nice. It looks and sounds great. The bad: the plot abandons common sense and continuity for the sake of being subversive. Since a lot of the beats don't make much sense\\, it's very effective at taking you by surprise\\, but it's not a satisfying viewing experience. Even the coolest moments in theory (like the big character death\\, the slick looking throne-room fight scene\\, and the lightspeed ram) are robbed of their coolness by the nonsensical writing. P.S. while that aforementioned fight is one of the best shot in the series\\, it's actually one of the worst choreographed. Slow it down a bit and it honestly looks fucking ridiculous\\, and I don't just mean the disappearing knife.","true":true}
