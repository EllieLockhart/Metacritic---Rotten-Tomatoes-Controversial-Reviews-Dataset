Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's obvious that Rian Johnson was in way over his head here and significant damage has been done to the franchise.  The movie is visually quite good but the writing\/plot is beyond bad.  Johnson should have hired a professional writing team.","true":true}
