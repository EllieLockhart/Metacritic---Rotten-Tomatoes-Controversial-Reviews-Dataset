Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without stating the obvious qualms that most people have about this movie\\, I'll just say that I didn't like it when it came out and my opinion hasn't changed much since. Yes\\, I'm an avid Star Wars fan and yes\\, I even liked the prequels. Regarding the prequels\\, that's simply because they are just Star Wars to me and also because of the nostalgia factor (I got into Star Wars after seeing TPM in the theatre when I was 16\\, sorry not sorry don't care). I loved The Force Awakens and didn't give a shit about it being too similar to A New Hope because it was simply a blast to watch and it FELT like Star Wars. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that I never feel like watching it. I just get bored and I don't care about anything that's going on. I suppose I look forward to the \\\"Rey\/Ren Imperial Guard or whoever they were\\\" duel and the \\\"Luke\/Ren\\\" fight that doesn't really happen. But even those scenes\\, along with the rest of the film just leave me feeling underwhelmed and still hoping for something else to happen. It's not a smart\\, bold\\, innovative and new direction in my book. We're not talking about a Stanley Kubrick film here\\, we're talking about a Star Wars movie. A Star Wars movie that definitely subverted my expectations in terms of wanting to watch the damn thing over and over again\\, just because it's Star Wars. With this one\\, I just don't care to watch it.","true":true}
