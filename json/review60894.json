Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"After having seen through the 20-ish hours of the game I am very disappointed by it.\r\rStarting off with the positive points:\r\r+ The soundtrack & audio; Gustavo Santaolalla pulls off another very emotional and fitting accoustic background which often returns with the guitar being played\\,\r\r+ The graphics; these are absolutely stunning\\, few games are on par with this and they can really get you into the setting of the game\\,\r\rNow off to why this game is just a 4 in my own opinion\r\r- The story; obviously this is where a lot of people nope out at the game\\, and I completely understand that\\, for some the sendoff Joel gets is a literal spit in the face (Yes\\, I mean that scene).\rThe character of Abby is being forced down your throat making her look like a good girl in comparison to Ellie. The absolute zero care I have towards Abby's friends... Was I supposed to feel something towards them when they died\\, like sadness and regret? I sure didn't with the exception of Owen who felt somewhat human. A lot of the events and actions that happen are so ridiculously far fetched it removes all parts of feeling somewhat realistic (who sends a pregnant woman out in the field? and don't come saying they got to pull their weight\\, as she's a trained doctor or medic she could surely take care of people in the WLF homebase without being put in the frontline). The relationship between Dina and Ellie was so angsty and insipid I mean\\, they are both 19 years olds who have gone through so much\\, do you really believe they have the time and know how to act like modern day 16 year olds who got into a first relationship.\r\r- The mechanics; pretty much the same as the last game and not very innovative\r\rAll in all a game that has not lived up to it's expectations which was hard from the start compared to the first part but nonetheless did badly.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
