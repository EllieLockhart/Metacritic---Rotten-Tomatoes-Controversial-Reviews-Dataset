Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a great movie. I'm so glad that I spent hour and hours in line when I was a kid to see the original eleven times\\, enabeling me to watch the franchise eventually turn into this. The special effects\\, that acting\\, that overwhelmingly well thought out story arc. My goodness\\, is there anything to complain about with this movie? It's a non-stop wonderful experience that I am so glad that I was able to have. This genre has in no way been overly watered down by the corproate movie machine that spits out contrite and rediculous garbage for the massses to shove down their gullet like so much fast food.\\n\\nAmazing. Everything I just said\\, was wrong. \\n\\nIf anyone had any humanity left in their soul they would take this franchise out behind the woodshed and mercifully put it out of our misery. All things need to perish so that their existence is relevant. I think this great story should have ended quite a while ago.","true":true}
