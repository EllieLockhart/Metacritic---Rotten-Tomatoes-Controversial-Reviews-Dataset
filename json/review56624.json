Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes some ambitious leaps in Act 1 of the movie. It's great. Unfortunately Act 2 is basically filler content\\, and serves almost zero purpose in driving the story anywhere. Coming into Act 3 you actually realize that every thing this movie had set up for you was just really redundant and not worth the payoff of sitting through 2.5 hrs. I'm not even talking about the ending here\\, just where we end up and how we got there is...annoying.","true":true}
