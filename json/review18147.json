Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was fantastic. My only quibble was that it was a bit long\\, especially in the middle.  But that pales in comparison with the emotional resonance and the performances\\, especially Mark Hamill's.  Can't wait for Episode IX!","true":true}
