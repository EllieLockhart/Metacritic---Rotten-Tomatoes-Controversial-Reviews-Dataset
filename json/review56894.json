Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were so many bad decisions made in the making of this movie. There's no need to list them all as other reviewers have done a pretty good job already.  I get the idea the director was going for\\, and I didn't like it.  A very strong dislike.  I liked the actors and the whole \\\"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\\\" because I love everything Star Wars... except the plot\\, and in how some characters were portrayed. This movie is Jar Jar Binks. yeah..","true":true}
