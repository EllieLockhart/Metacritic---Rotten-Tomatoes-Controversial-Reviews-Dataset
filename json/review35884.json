Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the first time a Star Wars movie has been genuinely surprising since the original trilogy. While it runs a bit too long\\, the pacing stutters\\, and some subplots could have been shortened more than a bit\\, Rian Johnson still delivers not only a really great Star Wars movie\\, but a good\\, fun movie in general. The returning characters from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" are still great (and there's more Poe this time! A lot more Poe! Thank God!)\\, the original trilogy characters are fun to see\\, and most of the new characters (besides Benicio Del Toro's......wait\\, I don't think they ever said his name?) are charming and fit well within the world. Also\\, the new \\\"cute and cuddly merchandise\\\" additions\\, The Porgs\\, are the best things to come out of the Star Wars universe in a long time and I would like them in every Disney movie from here on out please and thank you.","true":true}
