Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Turns out the Star Wars we all love and know is gone.\\nYou can tell it was all just to get disneys moneys worth out of the franchise. It was also used heavily as a political tool to push left wing ideaology; for example\\, every single strong\\, leader in this movie is female and every weak character\\, every villain is a man. They shove it right in your face and sure it made money in the cinemas thats because its star wars\\, but who's going to buy the toys? The books? The movie off itunes? No one.","true":true}
