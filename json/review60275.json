The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The story and the visuals were absolutely amazing! I'm sick and tired of everything labeling the game as \\\"Naughty Dog's Downfall\\\" all because of Joel being killed by Abby.\r\rHis death was going to come whether we'd like it to or not. He was a bad person\\, he did bad things. There were people coming after him and he knew that. That's why he already knew Abby had some sort of business with him.\r\rI'm tired of everyone just assuming because Joel is dead\\, this game is horrible. Characters we love die all the time. Maybe I just have a better understanding of why Joel was killed\\, or maybe it's because I've played Danganronpa before and I can understand a death that had a bunch of controversies and different opinions on whether that character should have died or not. Or maybe Danganronpa just taught me how to not be a little **** when a main character dies.\r\rThere was character growth with Abby when Yara and Lev became apart of the story. She grew as a person and wanted to do nothing but protect those kids. She became like Joel in a way and I think that just really shows how she is as a person.\r\rSome people are complaining about how Ellie wouldn't do what she did\\, but that's the thing about grieving. It can change you as a person. I've lost my mother-in-law almost two years ago (July 10th) and I'm not the same person I was two years ago. She was like a mother to me\\, and believe me- I would never actually harm a person. I don't like the idea of killing\\, but if I were in Ellie shoes- I would absolutely go after my parent's killers. It would change me as a person and I know this.\r\rIt really shows the true nature of grieving and the true nature of revenge. Nothing good can come out of revenge\\, and that was the message they were trying to place in the story.\r\rAlso\\, Abby's \\\"backstory\\\" wasn't there for a literal backstory. It was there to try and show you what kind of person her father was before he was murdered by Joel. That's the only reason on why it was there. To show her process through grieving too and to show why Ellie and Abby were so similar but so different at the same time.\r\rThe plot holes are there\\, I'd admit that- but I think they might have done that on purpose. There's already a discussion about making a part three\\, so maybe they left those questions unanswered so they're able to answer them later down the road. You never know- Naughty Dog might even post a DLC even though they said they wouldn't. They've done things they said they were going to do before.\r\rAll I'm saying is you can't hate or love this game until you give it a try and actually play it. Naughty Dog literally stated you'll either love it or hate it and that there's no in between. So go ahead and just get the game and play through it yourself. Give yourself the chance to experience it and create your own opinion.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
