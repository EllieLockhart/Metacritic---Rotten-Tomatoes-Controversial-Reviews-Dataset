Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No story progression...want to know all of your burning questions about the force awakens well they all get thrown in the trash and utterly forgotten or scrapped. Who is Snoke who cares he is dead ...kylo's obsession with his grandfather gone...Luke the bravest Jedi who risked his life because he saw good in his father all of a sudden trying to kill his sisters only son because he senses darkness in him????? Bullshit...you destroyed his charactor bad\\, bad\\, bad storytelling. Kylo is now the supreme leader and its him vs Ray ...not really interested.  30 years and that's how they send off Skywalker\\, a coward who gave into fear and created kylo ren.","true":true}
