Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most original and daring entry in this 40 year old series since Empire. While certainly not perfect\\, The Last Jedi manages to upend expectations and move the series forward in new and exciting ways\\, without rehashing the same old cycles of storytelling that have haunted recent episodes. There is an incredible amount of character story happening in this film that did not go the way so many people thought it would go. It was a blast of fresh air that helps to ignite new interest in the series.\\n\\nIn my opinion The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since Empire.","true":true}
