Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One was MUCH better. There is some action but the mood was dark and somber\\, the pace was slow and it was shot so dark that in 3D\\, where most theaters don't properly turn up the brightness\\, I couldn't see half the movie. Very disappointed. If it wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, I probably would have given it one more star just for scope and some fun action scenes\\, but the direction just seemed amateurish\\, some scenes and lines were just corny. I think critics liked the seriousness and drama like they always do\\, but the FUN that is part of the Star Wars legacy is missing.","true":true}
