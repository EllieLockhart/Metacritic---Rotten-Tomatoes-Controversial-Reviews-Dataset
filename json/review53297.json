Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Considering all the hype for the movie\\, thanks to the excellent ending of the previous installment and the incredible marketing campaign filled with great trailers\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not as good as it could've been. What initially seemed like it would be a masterpiece\\, ended up being close. Really close. It's somewhat uneven\\, with a lot of great action and suspense but weird moments as well. It's a risky movie\\, and most of the risks are successful\\, even though some are highly debatable\\, specially considering the fact that this movie is supposed to start the time when the new cast takes over the old one. Luke Skywalker was amazing in this movie\\, and while I initially disagreed with some of the choices Rian Johnson made\\, now I see what he tried to do\\, and how well he did actually accomplished it. The scope of this movie is new for Star Wars\\, because everyone who is relevant to the story gets a great amount of character development. The idea and the way that that idea is executed make this the first time the franchise has reached pure complexity. But if you're looking for solid entertainment\\, this will do just as well. It's a shame I can't give the movie a five-star rating. I wish I could\\, but some scenes in Canto Bight shouldn't have been in the movie\\, in my opinion. And the actual ending scene it's misplaced and should have been a post-credits scene\\, because what happened before it had already given a sense of conclusion.","true":true}
