Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"terrible movie - really destroyed a life long love. I do get that they were brave and trying to do something different but they missed the mark by so so far. I cant believe anyone actually signed this off and thought it was a good idea. The RT critics summary that the movie honours the saga's legacy is the opposite of the reality\\, it actually takes a massive dump on the whole thing. The prequels were bad movies\\, but they were star wars movies at least. It amazes me how out of touch the studio must be with those who are their products consumers. If you are new to star wars and havent seen the originals you may like this film\\, if you are like me a veteran of the originals do yourself a favour and avoid.","true":true}
