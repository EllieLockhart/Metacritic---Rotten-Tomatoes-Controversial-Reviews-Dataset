Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing story lines and a complete blunder of wonderful opportunity.  Quit making some of the most iconic (and my favorite) movie characters into sad losers and complete failures!!  These new characters are NOT interesting and do NOT spark any emotion.","true":true}
