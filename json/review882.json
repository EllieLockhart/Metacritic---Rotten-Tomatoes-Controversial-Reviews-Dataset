Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredible addition to the Star Wars franchise that delivers thematically in every front. In a movie obsessed with romanticization of the past\\, The Last Jedi offers a simple message: nothing is as you remember it\\, but that should not taint what it taught you\\, nor the inspiration it gave you to create a world better than any that coul have been dreamt up by those who came before you. \\n\\nIn addition to having some of the most visually stunning moments ever committed to the Star Wars series\\, it offers up some of the most thought provoking moments yet. I won't pretend that this film is going to resonate pleasurably with everyone\\, but it is a film made FOR everyone. A muted score\\, a lot of action\\, and an intervention in a lore that is often excused of its complexity as a result of affection\\, I welcome The Last Jedi...and whatever we become afterwards.","true":true}
