Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily of if the greatest Star Wars movies of all time! Saw it with the press at an early screening on Monday at Walt Disney studios. Such a great movie with a very emotional story. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so engaged into a Star Wars movie as much as this one had me hooked from beginning to end. ","true":true}
