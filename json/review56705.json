Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most disappointed I have ever been after seeing a movie. I will never see this again\\, nor do I care to see any other Disney Star Wars movie\\, and I liked Episode 7 and Rogue One. I did not follow any super-fan conspiracy theories about the characters from Episode 7. I went in with an open mind. And boy\\, did this movie suck. When it finally\\, mercifully ended\\, my face was buried in my hands. No tears of joy\\, I was just shocked by what a terrible movie it was\\, let alone a star wars movie. This is just a terrible movie\\, plain and simple. For sure\\, It has great sound effects\\, stirring music\\, and wonderful visuals. The actors are great within their roles\\, and some of the locations are interesting. But the plot is so full of holes\\, meaningless characters\\, terrible jokes and blatant marketing fodder that it is difficult to get behind anything in this story. The pacing is frustrating. The character development\\, or lack thereof is disappointing. The disregard for backstories\\, and previously established subplots and lore is frustrating. The outright dismissal of certain characters and what they supposedly meant to the story is insulting and undermines every Star Wars movie that came before it. The whole thing feels hollow and meaningless. Episode 7 wasn't perfect\\, but it was a good start that created a decent set-up for what could have been a very interesting and entertaining trilogy. Instead\\, we got this giant middle finger that tells us everything we thought we knew was meaningless and unimportant to Disney's new grand vision of Star Wars. Hollow thrill rides made specifically to shake as much money out of our pockets as possible before we can realize we have been duped. This is a hot-mess that should have never left the editing floor. I honestly found this movie more frustrating than the prequels. Do yourself a favor\\, and bum the dvd off your little brother in a year\\, see the disappointment for free\\, if ever.","true":true}
