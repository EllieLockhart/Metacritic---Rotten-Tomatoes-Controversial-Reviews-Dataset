Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the original trilogy and also enjoyed Rogue One. I even appreciate some elements of the prequel trilogy. While I generally disliked The Force Awakens\\, I hoped that its follow-up movie\\, The Last Jedi\\, would redeem it somewhat. Unfortunately my hope was in vain. The Last Jedi is full of plot holes\\, discontinuities from previous movies\\, and all-in-all just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. There's a lot of hate going around for those that don't like this movie\\, like we have an agenda to hate everything new or something\\, but if anyone has an agenda I would say it's the writers and producers of this film that have hijacked a wonderful film saga and cheapened it into a collection of poor writing\\, lame humor and force-fed social commentary.","true":true}
