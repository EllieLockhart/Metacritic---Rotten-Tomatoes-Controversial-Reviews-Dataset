Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are expecting more of the same Star wars you will not like this movie.  Last Jedi takes the star wars tropes and turns them on their head and gives fan not what they want\\, but something that could turn out to be far more rewarding in the end.  If you are expecting fan service like TFA\\, this is not it.  Go in with an open mind and you should be pleased.","true":true}
