Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\, was such a disappointment. The story was extremely boring and horribly paced. Not worth viewing in my opinion\\, which as a huge star was fan is a disappointment.","true":true}
