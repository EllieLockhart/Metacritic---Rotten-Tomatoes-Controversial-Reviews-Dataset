Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having watched this movie I was left very disappointed. The writing was poor\\, a lot of the themes and story elements that where laid down in the force awakens where completely thrown out the door by Johnson. Both Force Awakens and TLJ treated long cherished characters in the SW mythos like garbage\\, and to be honest they new characters where poorly developed. There as been a lot of talk about sexism and racism is the reason for these poor reviews\\, and that's just not true for the vast majority of the people give this film a poor review. The character of Finn (a Black Man) is not shown in a favourable light and as for Rose Tico she is such a poorly realised character.  I really could write an essay about it\\, but I don't have the time or inclination to do this. If you are a longtime star wars fan and you want to watch it\\, watch it\\, just be prepared to be disappointed.","true":true}
