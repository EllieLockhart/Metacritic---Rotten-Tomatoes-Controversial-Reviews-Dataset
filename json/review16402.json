Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sad that this is Carrie Fisher's last Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson kicks fandom in the face with his mishandling of the greatest Jedi in the galaxy far far away by not understanding Luke Skywalker. At times the movie seemed so silly that I thought they let Lord and Miller\\, whom they fired from the Han Solo movie jump in and direct this slapstick comedy.  Don't get me started on the being able to use the Force to \\\"Facetime\\\" sort of a \\\"ForceFaceTime\\\" if you will. I felt betrayed by the whole movie. Rian Johnson threw away the good will of the Fandom with this horrible movie. I don't want to even see Nine now\\, I cannot see how JJ Abrams can salvage Star Wars after this","true":true}
