Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost perfect. Definitely had some bad parts\\, like the Finn and Rose storyline\\, and i wish Kylo or Rey fully committed to going to the other side\\, this would be something we haven\u2019t really seen in a SW film. But this movie puts me on an emotional ride like no other one\\, and Adam Driver\u2019s acting is superb! I love the theme of failure and not giving the audience what they want. I\\, got one\\, didn\u2019t feel like they betrayed Luke\u2019s character\\, just made him evolved in a believable way. 3rd favorite Star Wars movie! ","true":true}
