Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made a rotten tomatoes account just so I could tell people to not go to this movie.  The character Rose was unbearable and made no sense to the plot other than trying to force a love triangle.  The only good actors in the entire film were Mark H. And Benicio.  Save your money and good memories of star wars and do not go to this movie. Go if you like seeing lame jokes and watching 2 hours of filler in a 3 hour movie.","true":true}
