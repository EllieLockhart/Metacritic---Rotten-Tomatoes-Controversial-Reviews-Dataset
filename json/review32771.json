Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was a fantastic turn for the series. As many disliked the movie I truly loved it. Many will agree that maybe there was a little too much at the end\\, however we don't just watch Star Wars because it's just another Science Fiction movie\\, but because for most of us Star Wars has been most a part of our childhoods for years and I believe as not a paid critic\\, but just another movie viewer that this is a great add on the the Star Wars story.","true":true}
