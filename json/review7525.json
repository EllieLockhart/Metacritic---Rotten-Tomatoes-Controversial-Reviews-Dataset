Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone has already complained about Luke I\u2019m sure but even Mark Hamill stated it was a different character. It is simply amazing how many plot holes were in this story and how characters on both sides didn\u2019t have an arc! They both end up on the same level at the end of the film! Way to make us excited and curious about episode 9 Disney! ","true":true}
