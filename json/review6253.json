Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, If your intention here was to shock and annoy traditional star wars fans and kill off the franchise\\, you have succeeded spectacularly. Laden with unecessary social themes\\, particularly feminism that screw up the story. Having been a life long fan\\, I now have zero interest in future movies. Epic fail! But worst still\\, it looks to me like a combination of clever marketing\\, franchise momentum\\, falsely (and ludicrously) positive professional reviews\\, and the curiousity factor are taking this shit heap to high box office takings. All of my fan friends hate this movie\\, most of the reviews from users and fans are low. I'm certain that the next movie will be a giant flop when people digest LTJ and process the reality of Rian Johson has done. Maybe then\\, one day\\, a director with actual talent and am understanding of star wars will reboot the sequel trilogy and give the fans the movie they deserve\\, till then\\,  RIP star wars!","true":true}
