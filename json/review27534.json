Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall it was great. Many theories didn't come to fruition but it didn't kill the movie for me. it was fun. The only disappointments were the lack of a strong Luke Skywalker and Leia's flight...Otherwise it was a great addition to the franchise and I can't wait to see how JJ Abrams finishes the trilogy.
