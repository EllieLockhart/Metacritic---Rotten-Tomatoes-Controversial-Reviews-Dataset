Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched the Last Jedi... well star wars is definitely a Disney movie. (Yes I know they've been owned by Disney for awhile)The movie was okay\\, 6.5 out if ten\\, slightly higher then the Force awakens\\, but still. I don't know what that was\\, but that wasn't a Star Wars. Side note\\, Rogue One has been the best of the three\\, and the only one that made me feel like I am watching. Good star wars.","true":true}
