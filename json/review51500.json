Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete disgrace. Mark Hamill was right to say the script was wrong for Luke. Disney has disrespected the Star Wars legacy by bringing politics into the movie. Disney had two goals with this movie: 1. Instill more females into Star wars in power positions 2. Make money.  The lack of strong and inspiring male leadership is incredibly disheartening to see but only makes sense when you look at the man directing this abomination.","true":true}
