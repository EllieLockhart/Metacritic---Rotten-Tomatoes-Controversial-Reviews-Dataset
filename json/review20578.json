Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never left a review for a movie before but I feel so compelled by just how absolutely horrible The Last Jedi was.  It is an insult to the franchise and if this is a sign of where it's headed\\, I'm even more concerned.","true":true}
