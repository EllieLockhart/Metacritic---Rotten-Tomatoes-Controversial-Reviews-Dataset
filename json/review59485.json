Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I had never played the Last of Us but had heard good things about that game\\, so I didn't want to miss out on this one. Presumably there were a lot of folks like me who were expecting a similar experience. What we get instead is a hodgepodge game with no sense of direction and an overriding theme all the time - revenge! Both the protagonists on this game are so driven by the sense of revenge that it just gets tedious after a while playing this game. The only thing that kept me going was the urge to explore the world. Boy does the story and narrative make it hard to do that. All said\\, this game is definitely not a 10\/10 as IGN's Jonathon Dornbush rated it. But it's not the worst either. The initial few hours are enjoyable\\, but once you start playing as Abby that's when things get bad. To me\\, RDR2 remains the gold standard when it comes to telling a story in a game. You could actually connect with the characters and that made the game so much more enjoyable. This game\\, not so much. So yeah\\, Naughty Dog\\, if you are reading this review\\, take this as feedback. It's not a bad game\\, it's just not the \\\"masterpiece\\\" IGN claims it is and which is probably what a lot of users were expecting too.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
