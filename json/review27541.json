Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall not a bad movie - if it wasn\u2019t a Star Wars movie. But it is a Star Wars movie and one that left me saddened and unsatisfied. I get where they were going with this film. But they step over or completely destroy good plot lines established in force awakens to get there. Bad move Disney. I\u2019m officially no longer excited about episode 9. I\u2019m not even taking my kids to see this movie because I fear they would be bored by it. Again\\, not a bad movie overall\\, but no payoff from force awakens setup\\, and it leaves you with no desire to see episode 9. :(","true":true}
