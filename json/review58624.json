Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I didn't like the weird pacing. The constant \\\"3 weeks earlier\\, 3 months earlier\\, 5 years back\\, and so on\\\". It was editted very poorly making the main story (about Ellie) feel off.The second part (about Abby) was useless\\, I couldn't make a connection with someone who killed Ellie\\, the main character of the best game ever made (TLOU) and Joel probably an even better character. It again comes down to pacing. Adding 12 hours of Abby after stuff gets interesting with Ellie really demotivated me. I had to start over again with a character I did not want to know.The Last of Us 1 had a story that didn't care about ethics and morals. It was about Joel loving Ellie. Going into fight or flight after not being allowed to say goodbye\\, nor getting payed for his deeds instead getting left out to die.Turning this on his head and focussing 1000% on morals and ethics in TLOU2 made it feel like the writers for the game missed the mark of the 1st one.TLOU1\\, 9\/10TLOU2:Good graphics and details (Naughty dog being Naughty dog\\, gg).Good gameplay but it gets a little repetetive after 20+ hours and a shame that all the zombies were the same as the first game accept for 2 new\\, rather uninspired additions. But good enemy AI overall.Not a story I personally connected to.Total: 4\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
