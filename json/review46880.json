Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We loved it!!! It could have had fewer porgs and cute animals\\, that is true; but the film has not only beautiful visuals\\, but also a great heart. It does not feel like a repetition\\, remake or copy\\, although it pays hommage to the original films in many ways. I loved Leia and her (finally!!) extended role in it\\, and Luke was just simply wonderful as an old grumpy hermit. I personally absolutely enjoyed the Rey and Kylo storyline and cannot wait to see more of the new unstable Supreme Leader. My new favourite Star Wars film!!","true":true}
