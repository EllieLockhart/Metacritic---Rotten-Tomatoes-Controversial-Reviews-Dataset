Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor storytelling altogether\\, amazing that they could have done so much but couldn't even put a coherent plot together.\\n\\nPlot holes all over the place\\, terribly written and terribly placed humour\\, every character fails (which would be fine if it had a satisfying payoff\\, but it doesn't)\\, the force awakens was completely ignored (might as well not have happened......zero story progress because everything at the start is the same at the end.\\n\\nIts nothing to do with having pre-made expectations and being disappointed\\, its everything to do with a bad story. Nothing wrong with different\\, but different does not equal good automatically.\\n\\nLeaves no set-up for the last of this atrocious planned trilogy\\, just no interest in what happens next.\\n\\nBesides some nice visuals and some nice acting here and there (and good intentions don't make a good plot)\\, very disappointing. Its a cash-grab by Disney\\, defended by those throwing money at them before even seeing the films.","true":true}
