Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The script is really only a bit above adequate in this film. Humor attempt was awkward\\, ill placed and political sub themes were so flipping annoying. It's like a virus in films we can't get rid of now. What bothered me most was Luke looking like he'd been hitting the bottle a bit too much atop his retreat. There was one scene I loved where Luke got excited to see R2 and it was great watching him again. Then he sunk into this deep voice that drove me nuts - yeah\\, he was old but old Ben still looked sober at least. I think most people agree you CAN follow up a great film with a great film (Empire Strikes Back) but it clearly didn't happen here. Who approves these final cuts of the film is what I want to know and why would they do this after such a great film like the Force Awakens?","true":true}
