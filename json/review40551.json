Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst film I've ever seen. If you enjoyed this film\\, it means you had terrible parents and there is no hope for you","true":true}
