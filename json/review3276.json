Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a fan for 12 years now\\, but this film made me hate STAR WARS. It has become so predictable and fill with plotholes & POLITICAL message its sad. I juste dont understand how its possible to miss the mark this badly.. Sad to see you go starwars farewell","true":true}
