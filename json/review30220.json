Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it today with my kids.  I'm giving it 1.5 stars only because the action and the space battles were awesome as always... but the story is simply meh.  So many things that didn't make sense or left unexplained.  Some points it felt like Batman vs Superman again.  Characters being killed off Game of Thrones style.  Catering to the Asian movie market.  It felt like Disney is pushing this for the younger generations to build a future cash cow and no longer cares about us 40+ year old farts.  Not going to waste my time or money on the next one.   It's been a fun ride RIP Star Wars 1977-2017","true":true}
