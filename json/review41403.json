Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an incoherent mess! No consistent plot not only between the episodes but within the movie itself. Side plots that go nowhere\\, feminism run amok\\, social justice. This movie has bad storytelling period.  The characters don't change or grow. They are static - Rey is a Mary Sue.  Horrible\\, horrible\\, horrible.","true":true}
