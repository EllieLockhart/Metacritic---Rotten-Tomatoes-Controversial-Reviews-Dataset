Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last time I went back to the theater to re-watch a Star Wars movie was in 1980.  I was 8 years old\\, and didn't see the first Star Wars in theaters\\, but I did happen to catch Empire Strikes back twice.   I ended up watching the remakes again.\\n\\nStar Wars - The Last Jedi is a movie I will go back and see again in the next few days.  Just seeing Carrie Fisher's last performance is worth the price of admission.   What I got is so much more.   The force was explained in simple Yoda like terms yet again\\, but it feels as mysterious as ever.   Unlike The Force Awakens\\, I didn't have a sense at any point of what would happen next.   TFA introduced some great characters\\, and explained what happened after RotJ\\, but it didn't add much to the Star Wars universe.  Even Rogue One added something to the back story.   TLJ pushes the franchise forward\\, and it does so with absolute disregard what the die hard SW nerds cares.  I love it for that.\\n\\nThe scenes are meticulous\\, the landscapes are beautiful\\, just as any Star Wars movie.   The characters and story are what make this such a great movie.   I left feeling emotional.   I left feeling hope.   Even though Carrie Fisher won't be gracing us again with her tough but caring presence\\, there is hope that I may be able to watch Star Wars for the next few decades and still have the chance to leave the theater feeling like I escaped into a world of adventure\\, darkness\\, light and most of all\\, hope.   I couldn't ask anything more of a Star Wars movie.  Now\\, let's see if Episode 9 can live up to the standard TLJ just set.","true":true}
