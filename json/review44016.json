Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Time will show this movie fits in to cannon as well as the originals. In 20 yrs nobody will be obsessed with who Rey's parents were or any of the other things people thought would be in the movie. Loved it!!!","true":true}
