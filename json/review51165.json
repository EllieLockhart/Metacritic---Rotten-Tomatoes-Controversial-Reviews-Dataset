Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely insulting to the franchise. If i go into all the things i hate about it i will be writing over 5 paragraphs and this movie doesn't deserve that kind of dedication from me.  Instead i will state what i enjoyed.....The performances of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver\\, and how their characters interacted\\, That is literally it. Everything else about this movie is absolutely terrible","true":true}
