Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The actual rating for this movie is under %27 here is why: Rotten Tomatoes does not count scores under one half star and Disney carries so much weight that reviewers are afraid to speak the truth lest they ruin their relationship with the studio. This is not a pet theory\\, it's obvious. Look at the overwhelming negative reviews here and especially on youtube. check out this video where a guy actually does the math:  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CWPAbKEmd5M\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nHaving said that....\\n\\nThis movie is perhaps THE greatest cinematic catastrophe of all time. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy should never work again. God help me if I ever see either of them  in public. \\n\\nRyan & Kathleen\\,  if you are reading this\\, remember\\, it's a small world after all.","true":true}
