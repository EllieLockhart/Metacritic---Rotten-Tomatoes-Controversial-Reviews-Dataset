Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally\\, I thought the film was very good. Good and bad points\\, but the worst part of any Star Wars film is the fan base. These people need to realise it's not 1977 any more\\, and storylines\/characters change. Because of immature neckbeards lashing out with unrealistic low rating\\, this currently has a lower user score than The Phantom Menace\\, SERIOUSLY????\\n\\nAnyway\\, it's easier to give pros and cons.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Cinematography was amazing\\, notably the kamikaze hyperspace jump\\, the battle in Snoke's throne room and Luke's showdown with Kylo\\n- Kylo's character development\\, fortunately the studios didn't bow down to the petulant audience criticising his character in TFA whilst he was still in early development. Adam Driver has done a brilliant job.\\n- Moving things forward. Yes\\, people die. Yes\\, storylines change. Get over it. The characters that died needed to\\, the story and progression has moved on\\, with several openings for Episode IX (like Rey's parents\\, wait until the next film you morons!)\\n\\nCons:\\n- Snoke has no back story at all. After the age of Vader\\, Snoke has risen as an all-powerful leader of The First Order\\, but when?? How??\\n- The casino planet bit\\, mostly unnecessary and a bit drawn out\\, also the whole Maz recommending a hacker (why contact Maz?) then them apparently getting the wrong one and the right one disappearing forever wasn't great.\\n- Luke and the milking thing. Nobody wants to see that.\\n- Space Leia. Everything about this scene\\, basically.","true":true}
