Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it on Sunday. Hate to admit it\\, but it was imho the worst Star Wars film to date. So many issues with this movie. Not going to bother to list them all.  Would highly recommend waiting to watch it.","true":true}
