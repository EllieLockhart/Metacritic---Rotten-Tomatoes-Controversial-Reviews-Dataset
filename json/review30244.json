Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw the last Jedi 72 hours ago-- It was incredible! there has never been a Star Wars movie like this one that's for sure-- someone said in this movie you laugh so as not to cry and I think that's spot on\\, things happen in this movie that will wind older fans-- and fans of the video games are probably going to be inclined to reject the humour as incongruent to the Star Wars they thought they knew-- but Star Wars doesn't belong to them\\, it belongs to everyone and we want to bring new young fans into our world -- movies are different from their video games\\, and franchises that have existed for this long risk getting stale\\, and Star Wars is too precious to go stale for the sake of nostalgia","true":true}
