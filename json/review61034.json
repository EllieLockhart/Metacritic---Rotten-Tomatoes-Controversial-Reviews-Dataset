Characters make dumb and laughable decisions throughout. The game relies heavily on shock value but not the kind that makes you feel emotional it is shock value that leaves you wondering what the developers and writers were thinking when they constructed this narrative. The ending is a joke and makes no sense. Over all very disappointed with the final product. If you must play this game because you are a huge fan of the original just wait for a sale or buy it used. Not worth $60 and has no replay value at all.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
