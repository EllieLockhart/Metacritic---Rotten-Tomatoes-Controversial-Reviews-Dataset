Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie in the Star Wars saga\\, even against episodes I and II it comes out as the weaker one. Full of plot holes and cheap and unsatisfying solutions. It feels like a cartoon\\, but it is a very bad one. Full of bad and unnecessary jokes all throughout the movie. Johnson even spliced tacky jokes at the middle of the utmost serious and important scenes. The movies is aesthetically very pleasing but I believe that is it's only truly strong point. CGI is excellent except in the Leia scene. Luke's behavior is Disney and Rian pissing in everything Lucas and Lucasfilm had accomplished and everything the fans wanted and needed. Truly the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced with Star Wars\\, and yes\\, I am very much aware of the prequels.","true":true}
