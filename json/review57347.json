Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is truly a roller coaster of emotions and settings\\, but I think it pulled off both quite well. There were some scenes that people less versed in the canon might scoff at (Leia's force pull)\\, but I feel like these points are pretty well explained in this and other movies in the series.\\n\\nThere is a hectic nature to this film\\, and that definitely sets it apart from other star wars main timeline films (rogue one is similar feeling)\\, but I don't think that's a bad thing since the storyline made sense and was cohesive. Despite traversing several planets and settings in space\\, it didn't seem that whirlwind to me. In fact\\, I would say that the amount of scenery and locations in this movie is pretty similar to Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nThe biggest gripe I had with this film are the answers to the big questions coming into this film from The Force Awakens. Who is Snoke and what's his story? Who are Rey's parents? Those two questions received pretty depressing answers in this film. One of them wasn't answered (and probably won't be\\, which is disappointing but it is the same resolution we had with another up and coming fan-favorite sith in the prequels)\\, but the other question actually was answered in this film. That answer about Rey's parents could be viewed as an extreme let down. I'm inclined to say \\\"wait and see\\\" what happens in the next movie\\, but I don't really feel the need to know any more. Given the closing scene of the movie\\, I feel this answer is the final answer on the subject.\\n\\nSo those expecting answers for those two questions will probably be disappointed\\, but a depressing answer is still an answer.\\n\\nAll in all\\, I will watch this movie many more times in my life\\, surely.","true":true}
