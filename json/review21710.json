Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a quick note on this film. I'm not primarily a Star Wars fan although I do enjoy the story of the Star Wars saga. When I first read and heard fan reviews of the film I thought that it must be a piece of crap and avoided it. It took 2 years\\, but I finally watched it so when I see The Rise of Skywalker I will have the complete story. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. \\nYes\\, some of the scenes were a bit campy and cheesy\\, but the action\\, heart and Star Wars atmosphere were all there\\, and it felt like a strong middle entry for the final trilogy. Aside from die hard Star Wars fans (which haven't liked any Star Wars film since The Return of the Jedi)\\, I don't see the negativity from audiences. I don't understand it. The movie was action packed\\, with excellent visuals\\, typically amazing music score and the typical campy Star Wars comedy that made The Last Jedi a fun experience. I'm actually excited to see how the saga ends. This film was excellent.","true":true}
