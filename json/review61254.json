Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Unlike all the whiny idiots here\\, I will give this game a fair review.  Get over yourself\\, Joel fanboys.  Killing has consequences\\, and he paid for his mistakes in a brutal\\, unforgiving way.  Such is the world of The Last of Us I and II.  The game is very good.  I didn\u2019t agree with all aspects of the story\\, but I can appreciate it all the same.  On a technical level the game is 10 out of 10.  Stunning. The only knocks that bring it to an 8 for me are the Seraphine storyline which I found drug on WAY too long.  In general\\, the 3rd act is just way too long.  And the violence.  Oh\\, yes\\, the violence.  I don\u2019t actually mind it too much because it does fit the narrative for the most part. But I did find some spots where the game was just ghoulishly violent for the sake of it\\, not that it fit the story well at that point.  And for that I will knock a point off.  But all in all\\, Naughty Dog\u2019s \u201cvery good\u201d game is still better than almost any other studio\u2019s best efforts.  They are just that good and TLOU2 is no exception.  It\u2019s a very good game that fails to quite live up to the sublime first installment\\, but that doesn\u2019t make the game a 4 like so many other idiots here are rating.  Grow up\\, people.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
