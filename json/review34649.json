Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography in this film is epic\\, compare it to the other films in the franchise it stands out as just beautiful. The narrative is clear and the characters start showing development especially Rey and Po. The fight scenes are to die for\\, the film as a whole is just brilliant.","true":true}
