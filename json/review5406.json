Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite high expectations and inexplicably glowing critic reviews\\, The Last Jedi is a visually stunning yet ultimately hollow and pointless film. With shockingly poor and sometimes nonsensical writing\\, countless miscues\\, and marginal character development\\, it squanders the opportunity to be a powerful bridge between the original trilogy and the new adventures to come. While The Force Awakens is highly derivative\\, it's fun and nostalgic - but more importantly\\, it launches an interesting and compelling new cast of characters and stories to explore. It sets the stage for them to develop\\, and stokes anticipation about where they will go next. Sadly\\, they go nowhere. With Luke's toss of his lightsaber\\, Rian Johnson throws out virtually every element of story\\, mystery and goodwill engendered by TFA. The Last Jedi\\, with its many pointless subplots\\, utterly squanders the potential of Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, Snoke\\, Finn and Poe with shallow\\, lazy writing and little to no character development - or any discernible story arc or gravity to their actions. But most grievously\\, Leia and Luke's stories are so utterly absurd\\, against established character and ultimately disappointing\\, it manages to both fail to advance the new trilogy and wholly insult the original source material. Without a doubt\\, for new stories to be told\\, the old stories must be brought to a satisfying conclusion - and old characters must leave the franchise. The Last Jedi accomplishes neither - and utterly fails to develop its new heroes and villains\\, and tell a compelling story that inspires viewers to care what happens next.","true":true}
