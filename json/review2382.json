Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Audience reviews are mostly useless. Adding this one mostly to offset the stupidity reflected by the current 55% audience score while Justice League's is 79%.  \\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi is the most emotionally wrenching of all Star Wars tod ate. As we all should have guessed\\, it's gorgeous and the animals cute beyond reason. What moved me most are the characters\\, their bravery\\, and their willingness to give everything for what they think is right. \\n\\nIf you want to be pissed for stupid\\, made-up reasons that say more about you than the movie\\, go ahead and read people complaining about rubber chickens and Mary Poppins and nod your head. If you're a fan of Star Wars\\, watch the movie and have a great time.","true":true}
