The atmosphere is dripping with amazing attention to detail. I mean from exploring abandoned cities and towns to sneaking your way through the woods and traveling across from seashore to seashore etc. There are many more different locations to explore but with caution. The controls are pretty well polished and easy to grasp aside from a few hiccups. The sound design is almost perfect. Those dang clickers. There are not enough enemy varieties IMO. Only the regular infected and the clickers are present with a new type of enemy which are forgettable and annoying at best. The characters are very boring and one sided. I mean I didn't get attached to a single character like in the previous game. The character building and progression was all over the place. I mean by the time you start liking a character then the game introduces new characters as story fillers. The presentation was not as impactful as in the original. I was never on the edge of my seat. Now the story..... well the story was completely bad. Now this is my review and opinion. Apart from time jumps which were very poorly done and out of place. I think they ruined the pace of the game. There was a certain plot point in which was the driving force behind the whole game direction. They tried something balsy but failed. I found myself annoyed and mad playing the game and by the time I finished\\, I literally didn't have that feeling of not wanting the game to end. I was glad when the game ended. Towards the end I felt the game was dragging and went on too long. In closing\\, I didnt enjoy this game as much as the first one. The graphics were amazing and the controls were easy to grasp but the story\\, presentation and characters were all letdowns for me. Also there were not enough enemy variety.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
