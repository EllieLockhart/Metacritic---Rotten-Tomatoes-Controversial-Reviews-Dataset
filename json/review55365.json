Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Don\u2019t understand the bad reviews at all other than people are nostalgic for the original movies because they were part of their childhoods. I watched all of the Star Wars as an adult and I can say that this movie was as great as the rest of them. ","true":true}
