Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you hate this movie you clearly don\u2019t really appreciate the original trilogy and probably have you understanding of Star Wars warped by the prequels over explaining everything.
