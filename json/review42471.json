Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment. We had waited two years to see Mark Hamil shine again in his role as Luke Skywalker. Instead\\, they had him cast as a bumbling fool.  They wasted our time showing characters we don't care about running around a casino looking for a code breaker that they never met. The dark side is now led by a whiny little kid. There are so many other upsetting things. You had an opportunity to make a great movie and you threw it away.","true":true}
