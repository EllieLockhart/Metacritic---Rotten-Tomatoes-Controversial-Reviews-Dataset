Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't hate this movie in any capacity\\, though I was thoroughly disappointed with the final product. As a critic\\, I found the film to be too long\\, convoluted\\, and extremely inconsistent. The film was not paced well\\, and featured some very mind boggling scenes that are incomprehensible. As a Star Wars fan I was let down by the character arcs and little plot progression. All that being said\\, there is still some fun to be had with this film\\, though you may feel puzzled and angry over creative decisions that seem down right lazy\\, weak\\, and confusing. At least some of the fight scenes and action are artistically beautiful\\, though still make no sense. Music is good\\, CGI is a step up from The Force Awakens\\, and the characters are fun but have little to no motivations that we as a viewer are aware of\\, except for vague motivations that try to get the story to continue to wherever Disney is planning to take the Franchise. 2\/5 because it's still a Star Wars film and I loved some elements and scenes\\, but can't discuss them without spoiling key plot points. Overall this review had been all over the place with my reactions and feelings over Episode VII\\, but still has more consistency than the film itself.","true":true}
