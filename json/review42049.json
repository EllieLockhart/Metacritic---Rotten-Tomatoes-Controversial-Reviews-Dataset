Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes the main characters feel like the Marvel superheroes. You have no emotion towards them because they never bleed\\, get hurt\\, tired\\, etc. They just got the super powers and you know nothing will happen to them. They really need to change from super hero movie formula to the Marvel tv shows on Netflix. More down to earth\\, gritty\\, real life story telling. What we have here is a bunch of stuff visually great with terrible story plots.\\n\\nToo much crazy CGI fighting scenes where stuff would never happen. We don't need a movie that incorporates fast and furious bullshit action. That stuff kills the movie. Just like they ruined star trek beyond\\, they have ruined the last jedi.\\n\\nI long for simpler times when they just had a good story and good acting. Many sub plots and stories that add nothing to the story and detract from it as a big waste of time. Too many comedic\/humor moments thrown in to the movie\\, makes it seem less serious and more of a joke since the storytelling was bad.","true":true}
