{"101487":134059,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched Star wars through the years as a huge fan of the saga. What I got with last Jedi was an unfocused story with mediocre acting. I'm giving it a star for some great action sequences but the jokey nature of the story just undermines the weight it could have had. I am trying to keep this spoiler free but the two person adventure in the middle of the story has zero purpose except to maybe tick off a box for the international market. See it on a matinee for the big screen spectacle but keep your expectations on the story low and you may enjoy it. What a waste Disney.","true":true}
