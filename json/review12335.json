Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I  am still shocked at  what a terrible movie this was.  After I saw so many bad reviews on it\\,  my  father just told me  to go and see the film for my self.  Most of the things about the movie was   dread ful.... the plot was very thin\\,  almost non existent...  it was apt as though random events happened in the    movie for the sake   of happening.  None of the characters arcs changed at the end\\,  especially Rey and Finn.  Rey was supposed to  be trained by Luke\\, and all he did was make her sit on  a rock and \\\"reach  out\\\".  The humour was   bad\\,  a very  forced\\, Disney type of humour that  was through out most of the film\\n\\nI  went three times to see it\\, the first time in a bigger cinema\\, and the last two times in an independent cinema in Peckham.... and those last two times were to try  and see the film with a more open mind and try  to see it from    the perspective of the good reviews... all three times I thought  the same about the film and each time got worse","true":true}
