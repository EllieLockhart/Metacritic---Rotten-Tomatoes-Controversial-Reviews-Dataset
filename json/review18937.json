Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a visual masterpiece\\, but the storyline is awful. Mark Hamill puts forth his best performance\\, but he's the only one. If a movie is a sequel shouldn't it at least try to collaborate with the previous film? The lack of character development and political agendas are way too obvious for what is supposed to be a fun\\, kid friendly film.","true":true}
