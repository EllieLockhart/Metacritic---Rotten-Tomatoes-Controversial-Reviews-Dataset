Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t be fooled by the current 56% average viewer review. This movie rocks and you won\u2019t be disappointed. If you are\\, well find something else to watch and nitpick. Funny\\, touching and lots to cheer about. Unexpected twists made this movie so much more fun to watch. I have no idea where the conclusion will go and that\u2019s a good thing. ","true":true}
