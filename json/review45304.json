Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter crap. Whiny Luke Skywalker\\, purple haired Jill Stein in space\\, pointless anti-capitalist diversions\\, bizarre and nonsensical character behavior\\, just general crap writing. 90% of the cartoons I've watched in the last 20 years were better than this movie.","true":true}
