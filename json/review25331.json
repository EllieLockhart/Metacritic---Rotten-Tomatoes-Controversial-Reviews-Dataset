Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No independent and self-respecting film critic can honestly recommend this latest addition to the Star Wars story.  It's poorly written\\, acted and edited.  The so-called \\\"surprising twists\\\" were merely poor choices made for convenience sake.  Make no mistake that this is bad movie and if it was not part of the Star Wars story\\, it would have died a just death after the first week of showings.  I think that one of the last scenes in this terrible movie properly reflects just how badly it's written when the last vestiges of the rebel alliance is trapped and for 10-15 minutes of the movie they continue to say there's no way out except through the giant opening and door (question:  why would there ever need to be such a giant door?).  But then at the last minute...\\\"oh wait a minute\\, there is another way out of here\\\".  Yeah....that was some brilliant writing.","true":true}
