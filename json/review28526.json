Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably close to the worse Star Wars movie ever made. Story made no sense\\, jokes were terrible and Rey\u2019s parents reveal was a waste. Honestly could not wait for this movie to end. That\u2019s $13 I\u2019ll never get back.","true":true}
