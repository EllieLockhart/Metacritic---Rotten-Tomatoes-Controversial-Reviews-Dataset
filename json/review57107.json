Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terribly made movie that was careless in storytelling and took risks and made jokes just for the wow factor. This director and its team of writers have seriously set back Star Wars and heres hopping JJ can get some experienced writers to get this trilogy back on track. A laughing Yoda burning the Jedi history ?  R2D2 who prefers to stay off most of the time.  A portrayal of Luke Skywalker thats hideous and of course he has die. We dont want any original trilogy fans being happy hes back in action even with a new cast of characters.  And just stupid jokes everywhere.  And whats up with the \\\" I am stupid \\\" character descriptions in the beginning.  That alone just about killed the movie experience for me.  Please Disney get Rian Johnson as far away from Star Wars as you can if you actually want to make money.  This movie is terrible.  And let me conclude with get your political progressive ideas out of entertainment.  Yes we notice EVERY leader EVERY major character etc is a WOMAN.  This doesnt make good entertainment having this forced down your throat every movie and tv show.  Entertainment is suppose to be entertaing and make you money. Please understand this concept.","true":true}
