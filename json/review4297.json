Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Call me crazy I just didn't get it... a lot going on\\, had some super cool parts but the rest of the time I was just thinking to myself \\\"am I the only one not really enjoying this movie?\\\".","true":true}
