Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage! Rian Johnson you are a fu***ng asshole! You just destroyed the beloved legacy characters to do 'something different'\\, which in this case amounts to promoting Kathleen Kennedy's negative feminism agenda at the expense of what could and should have been a brilliant movie. Look at Rogue One - that had a female lead who worked well\\, but it was also well written\\, and didn't deride the male characters or destroy our beloved legends did it now? Same with TFA\\, which was also a good film that built on the past and worked with it. What you have done is take a giant shit on the past to try and move things forward. So what nest\\, shall we make a Rocky movie\\, where it turns out that Rocky used to be a woman\\, or he's beaten up by Adrienne after she takes a couple of tae kwon do lessons\\, because\\, you know it'\\, duh... duh... 'different!!!' Fu***ng asshole!. But you know folks\\, even putting this issue aside (which is very hard to do)\\, the film was plain terrible! Bad dialogue\\, lazy writing (e.g. Luke throwing the sabre over his shoulder (I though I was watching an advert\/parody!)\\, putting Finn and Rose in a jail cell with the exact character they're looking for\\, killing Snoke with a cheap\\, unbelievable twist that contradicts every aspect of his character up to that point\\, poor character arcs everywhere\\, Laura Dern's character waiting till almost every rebel had died before saving a handful of rebels\\, blatantly ripping of Empire Strikes Back with a AT-AT's on snow (sorry salt.... because it's duh.... duh.... different!) and on and on and on..... How did this pr*** make it through film school. A basic script writing lecture should cover the mistakes made in this pile of trash!). I've been watching movies all my life\\, never had this much anger.\\n\\nSo to sum up:\\n\\nA Terrible movie\\nB Unnecessarily  political correct\\, negative feminism bandwagon","true":true}
