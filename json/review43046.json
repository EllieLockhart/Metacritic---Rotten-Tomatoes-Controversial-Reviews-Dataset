Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very good\\, very entertaining. I\u2019m not sure I understand all the complaining about the subplots and how the stories of some of the characters ended up\\, or how certain bits of information weren\u2019t revealed in a manner that was pleasing to some. Honestly it seems like a lot of the negative reviews are from people who didn\u2019t get their way. This is what happens when you give out participation trophies. Don\u2019t listen to them\\, go see it. Aside from a couple scenes that were a bit cheesy\\, as a whole it is really fun to watch. ","true":true}
