Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. The lack of story development and jumping around hurts this one. There were some bright spots: a brief revisit of Maz\\, the code breaker (not the thrown together arc to get to him)\\, the humor at the right spots (not all of the humor was well done). In short\\, being a long time fan (the 1st trilogy was ok)\\, I am not interested in EP9. Something has been lost since the move to Disney.","true":true}
