Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As always \\, a Star Wars film has great visuals and epic star fighter battles. I theatre in disbelief and denial of this being a continuation of the storyline and saga. There were a few high points to the film \\, but it was completely overshadowed by Luke being completely out of his character seen in the original trilogy.overall if he was giving more interaction\\, purpose\\, and a proper ending to his legacy then I believe the film overall would have seemed a lot more balanced. I assumed it would have been obvious audiences were curious about Luke's level of power and knowledge of the force after being in exile for such a long time. It was very disappointing to not even see him to physically leave the island and actually intervene in some way shape or form. The extent of how powerful he was or wasn't will be a mystery. His departure and character development or lack there of left me feeling empty and disappointed . The rest of the film was mediocre and underwhelming at best. I really hope episode 9 somehow ties all of it together or redeems the story.","true":true}
