Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Picture a Star Wars movie written by the ultimate fanboy. Everything you think you'd want in a Star Wars movie\\, all that nwrd-knowledge of deep lore. \\n\\nNow\\, toss that trash out. Open your mind to something NEW\\, something (certified) FRESH. If you can handle that\\, you'll appreciate this incredible work of art.","true":true}
