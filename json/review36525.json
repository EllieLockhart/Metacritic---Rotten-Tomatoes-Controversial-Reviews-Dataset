Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie ended and received courtesy claps at best. Rian wrote a terrible script with great visuals and some well placed humor.  Once again\\, the critics are completely out of touch with what makes a movie great.","true":true}
