Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another solid chapter in the Star Wars saga that left me wanting more.  This movie has its problems and yet I found myself able to forgive most of them thanks to some amazing scenes and character development.  I look forward to the final instalment\\, and feel the future is bright for the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
