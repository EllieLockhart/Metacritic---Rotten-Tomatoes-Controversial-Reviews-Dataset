Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor attempt at humor was an utter disgrace to mark hamill and Carrie Fisher\\, wasted plot potential\\, wasted the knights of ren\\, wasted a good mysterious villain supreme leader snoke\\, a bland flick with no memorable twists or elements to add excitement for the 3rd installment.","true":true}
