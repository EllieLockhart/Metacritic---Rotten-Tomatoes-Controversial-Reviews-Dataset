Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, but the acting from half the crew was average which had to do somewhat with the poor writing. The comedy was forced at times\\, they just blew off so many of the fan's unanswered questions\\, and took too many liberties with the force. I can only wonder if Carrie Fisher's untimely passing had something to do with the underwhelming performance of many aspects of the movie.","true":true}
