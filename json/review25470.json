Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No respect for anything that came before nor concern for what is to come. I get that Disney is attempting to basically build a new marvel like movie machine with the Star Wars universe. Still\\, killing off everyone isn't exactly storytelling. Some of the visuals were incredible but after selling a billion buck of tickets by promising Luke Skywalker\\, why diminish him so much and then kill him off for no good reason. Because they couldn't think of anything more clever. This movie pretty much ended the saga dead in its track.","true":true}
