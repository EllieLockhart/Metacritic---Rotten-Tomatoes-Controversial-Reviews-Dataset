Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a great movie. i loved the character development how it makes you question what you thought you knew about the force. i don't love the plot of this movie but it makes up for t in character and world development. i loved the sexual tension between rey and kylo and am excited to see where that goes in the next movie. this really makes you understand what really means bringing balance to the force means\\, and i loved how it turned away from the jedi being these perfect all powerful beings we have seen in the past. excited to see what comes next.","true":true}
