Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an intense\\, emotional and absorbing experience that is never dull and unlike its predecessor it constantly subverts your expectations.\\n\\nIt is by no means a perfect film however...\\n\\nI've seen some incredibly negative reviews on this site and others\\, which\\, in my opinion\\, massively overstate the flaws in the film\\, but they are there for all to see.\\n\\nChief amongst these flaws are some very strange narrative choices.  The Force Awakens for all its problems\\, set up some great characters with endless possibilities.  I won't go into specifics\\, but The Last Jedi has laregely eschewed exploring the journeys these characters begun in The Force Awakens in favour of creating it's own admittedly intriguing\\, yet more convuluted narrative threads.   In the process\\, many of the characters story arcs we had become invested from The Force Awakens are left dangling in the air.  \\n\\nSome reviews have picked up on the inclusion of humour at various points throughout the film\\, stating that this has created an overly light tone.  I couldn't disagree more as whatever jokes there are in the film (there really aren't that many) don't detract from a decidedly dark tone that seems to have been deliberately pursued throughout.  I personally felt the humour added some much needed levity to a film that constantly puts its characters in the most bleak situations I can remember in any Star Wars film.\\n\\nAnother significant highlight of the film is Mark Hamill.  All of his and Daisy Ridleys shared scenes are electrifying and they are by a substantial margin the strongest part of The Last Jedi.  Hamill's portrayal of a broken\\,lost and guilt ridden Luke Skywalker is fascinating and proves rich narrative ground to explore.  It is an example of Rian Johnson's experimental and idiosyncratic approach to these iconic characters and themes working beautifully and makes you wish it clicked in this way more often throughout the film.\\n\\nIn spite of the above flaws\\, The Last Jedi is incredibly ambitious and because of this I admire it greatly and because of this\\, overall as a film I found it more satisfying than The Force Awakens.   The sheer complexity of the film leads me to suspect that it will reward multiple viewings (which I intend to do) and there is more than enough here to love and make you soar if you are a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
