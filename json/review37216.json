Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original Star Wars films were about victorious hope\\, that unity binds us all\\, and overcoming the evil inside yourself. Luke Skywalker is the embodiment of a character archetype that is old as storytelling itself. He rises from nothing\\, pursues knowledge and enlightenment\\, overcomes despair\\, becomes a savior\\, and through courage and determination redeems the sins of the ones who came before him. His purpose as a character and as an icon is to personify everything a human should hope to become.\\n\\nIn The Last Jedi\\, Luke Skywalker tries to murder a child in his sleep\\, then cries in a cave for a few years while the world around him crumbles\\, then gets lectured by a teenager about responsibility\\, then dies nonsensically. Knowing that\\, go look at every other plot point and twist in this movie. This film's sole purpose isn't to push things forward or build upon anything. It is reckless subversion for the sake of subversion. It is deconstruction with no meaning or purpose. It is a cynically assembled soapbox\\, made by people so arrogant and unappreciative that they would stand atop the legacy of one of film's most quintessential tales just to make an uninsightful\\, short-sighted point about \\\"leaving the past behind\\,\\\" and toss some hamfisted political notes at the captive audience. It is worse than any corporate cash-in or any moronic prequels. The Last Jedi is an articulate attack on Star Wars itself and everything it represents. These people had no idea what they were dealing with. The Last Jedi was cinematic manslaughter. \\n\\nIf you enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, you do not care about Star Wars. You don't care about the transcending timeless power of stories and myths and archetypes. You're just a dog who drools when the bell rings. Star Wars and Luke Skywalker can't be tarnished by anyone - that story was already told\\, and at most is only one fleeting incarnation of one of humanity's oldest traditions. You can't crush that\\, the The Last Jedi tried.","true":true}
