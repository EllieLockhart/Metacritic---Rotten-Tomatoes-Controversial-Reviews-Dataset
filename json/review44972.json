Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ultimately disappointing. A few enjoyable scenes and an epic finale with Luke's sacrifice. Rian Johnson's rogue directorial effort was simply off course and got lost in space. ","true":true}
