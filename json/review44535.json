Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To surmise this garbage movie\\, it's a total betrayal of Luke Skywalker's character\\, Rian Johnson tarnishes the legacy George Lucas created by reducing our beloved characters to insignificant and apathetic bystanders\\,  all previous character development from the original trilogy is cast aside and we are faced with characters doing and saying things that are the complete opposite of who they've been built up to be\\, there is a complete lack of essential context to the frankly bizarre key moments in this film\\, overall it's just a trainwreck of a story dolled up with great visuals.","true":true}
