Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is everything I feared TFA would be but was not. Whereas TFA did indeed reinvent a lot of the traditional Star Wars concepts and iconography with a modern twist\\, which is exactly what the series needed\\, TLJ actively rubbishes many of the series most stable and well thought-out concepts and plot lines in a directorial ego-trip in which Johnson feels he has the power and the right to completely change what \\\"is\\\" Star Wars. The film is over-filled with very badly judged humor\\, which will seem dated in 5 years it's so of-the-moment\\, let alone 40. There are countless plot holes and sub-plot write-offs\\, huge\\, meaningless scenes and the best elements are all almost direct copies of previous scenes (imperial walkers on a white planet\\, small good guy comically taking charge of an at-st). The death of Snoke is inexplicably easy\\, ruining a huge build up to the question of just how powerful he could be. Personally I've never felt intellectually insulted by any film more than this\\, it's a cliche to say it but the only reason I did not walk out of the cinema (something I have never even considered doing before) was to not upset my partner who had come along with me. The only way the series could be saved is if JJ Abrams sticks as much of a finger up at this in Episode IX as Johnson did to all the other films here.","true":true}
