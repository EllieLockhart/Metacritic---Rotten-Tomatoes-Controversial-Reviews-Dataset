Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overly-witty\/jokey winking-at-the-audience self-aware snarkfest determined to every 3 minutes remind you it's 2017 and not a galaxy far\\, far away\\, focus-group generated cast of perfectly diverse millennials of whom the protagonist is a flawless featureless demi-god\\, plot variously a nonsensical reboot of the originals aggressively stripped of soul and replaced with calculated nostalgia or otherwise stuffed with contrived \\\"twists\\\" like Han's stupid\\, undignified death at the hands of a Hot Topic employee\\, art style is \\\"extended CGI cut-scene\\\" that manages to feel both weightless and fake while killing the gritty 70's motifs and any sense of temporal continuity between the two trilogies\\, in general a generic 201X Hollywood Blockbuster (Snark-CGI-Nostalgia golden ratio) adapted from a 6th grader's fan fiction.
