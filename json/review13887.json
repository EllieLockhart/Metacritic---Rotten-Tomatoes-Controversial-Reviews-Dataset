Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a fan\\, you must watch it more than once to appreciate the story presented\\, and then possibly enjoy a truly great addition to the saga. Episode IX will be the icing or mold on the cake\\, JJ better come through for concluding this trilogy.","true":true}
