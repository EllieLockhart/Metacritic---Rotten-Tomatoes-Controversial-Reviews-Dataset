Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an objectively bad story with objectively nice visuals.  If it was anything but Star Wars\\, it would make nothing in the box office and be on DVD in a month.\\n\\nDisney knew it would tank\\, which is why they forced all the theaters to show it for 4 weeks.  Good luck trying that next time\\, Disney.  Could you imagine Lucasfilm having to force theaters to show \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" for 4 weeks?   That just shows you -- despite what Disney says -- they have no faith in this film and know it is crap. \\n\\nGoogle \\\"Disney L.A.
