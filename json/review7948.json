Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing cliched movie. There is very litle character development for Poe and Finn. Did anyone really care  abotu the fight scene between Finn an Phasma? The scenes of Leia  escaping and the entire casino scene both were too comical to enjoy. The character of Luke was complteley unbeleiavable. And then when they brought some life to his character they added a boring ending.  If you want some fun go back and watch The Empire Strikes Back or The Force Awakens. This movie - The Last Jedi is just purposely silly. It could have been worse. They could have resurrected Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
