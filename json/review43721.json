Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the first time I felt so emotionally connected to a Star Wars film since I was four and watching Return of the Jedi for the first time. Unlike Force Awakens this was not a direct clone of a previous installment\\, unlike the prequels this balanced practical and digitally assisted special effects very well\\, unlike Rogue One it felt like it really took place in the universe. It paid its respects to the original trilogy\\, but was still...\/new\/. I have no idea where the complaints are coming from (my only one was that Luke does that one thing in flashback that I don't think he would have done\\, but his character is still well treated). Luke was my hero as a little kid\\, and I didn't feel like this did him a disservice. Yeah\\, its not the EU\\, but we were told before Force Awakens that we wouldn't be getting the EU. TFA felt hollow and soulless\\, but this felt like such a love-letter to the original storylines. It really truely felt like a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
