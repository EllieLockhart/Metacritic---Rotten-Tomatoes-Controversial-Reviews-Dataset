Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. While critics seem to love this movie\\, a lot of fans like myself don\u2019t understand the love. Some of the issue are with the story\\, some of it with the pacing and some of it with the acting. In particular\\, the dark\\, brooding Luke\/Mark comes across more as a grumpy old guy that a tortured soul (get off my lawn\/planet). The whole trip to find the \u201ccode breaker\u201d was filler. And the humor that was inserted made the film feel like it was trying to copy the Marvel formula. I love the Marvel movies\\, but that is not the right tone to use for Star Wars. Every Star Wars fan is going to see this movie\\, but I doubt that most of them will be satisfied. ","true":true}
