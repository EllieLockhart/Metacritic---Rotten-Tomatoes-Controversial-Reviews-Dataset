Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really liked the game\\, i hated it at first because of what they did story wise\\, it was just so quick and at first i thought to myself \\\"How can Joel be so careless\\\" But after finishing the game i get it\\, he lived in Jackson for 5 years\\, he's getting older and is softening up a bit\\, still feels guilty to Ellie for what he did in the first game. Joel took Ellie her goal\/purpose in life away from her\\, she was supposed to die in that hospital for a possible vaccine and she was okay with it. I have trouble with writing out how i feel precisely about the game\\, but i really liked it\\, the story it told & the general message about the cycle of revenge and vengeance was super. I hated playing as Abby on day 1 but through the cutscenes and discovering her dad was killed by Joel\\, her interactions with her group of friends and Yara and Lev made me really like her. The graphics\\, level design\\, music are also super. seriously impressive. I liked the improved combat system with the dodging mechanic and being able to squeeze through small spaces. The upgrade animations were also super cool and i enjoyed watching those. For me this game was for sure a worthy sequel and a 10\/10. It's sad to see the hate online and the review bombing on here (i feel like 70% off those havent even played the game or even own a PS4 to begin with)\r\rI remember Neil saying the game would divide the fanbase\\, and it sure did. I really enjoyed it though and i'd like to thank everyone at Naughty Dog for making the game. I hope they are doing fine and are proud of the game besides all the undeserved hate and controversy regarding the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
