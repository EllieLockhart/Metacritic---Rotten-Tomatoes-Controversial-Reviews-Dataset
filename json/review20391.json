Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand some of the issues people had with this film\\, I have some of them myself but found them less bothersome rewatching.  It's a very well made film with amazing moments and the cast is great.  I don't buy that all of these negative reviews are legitimate\\, it's a great time at the movies.","true":true}
