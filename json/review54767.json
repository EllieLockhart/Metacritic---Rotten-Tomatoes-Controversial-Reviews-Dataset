Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It could've been so much better\\, I felt like I was waiting for something huge to happen and it just never really did. Overall I think the writing was too comedic and not enough focusing on the important details of the film. Also the scenes seemed a bit jumpy and it threw me off quite a bit. I was so excited after TFA for the next installment but Rian Johnson delivered a bit of a let down\\, and I think JJ Abrams would have met the standard much better. However I'm despite of these faults The Last Jedi did offer some good Star Wars moments filled with what we all know and love\\, but at the end of the day it just fell short in the key major moments of the story. The best part about this film was Carrie Fisher no doubt and it truly was beautiful to see what a great job they'd done with Leia and her storyline. ","true":true}
