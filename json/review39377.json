Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is just aweful: plot\\, subplots\\, and script. I cringed at least 5 times. It should be stricken from canon. if you are a fan of the originals\\, dodge this like the plague. Driver and Hamil are great. Its also a crime Billy Dee Williams isnt in here\\, but they would just diminish him\\, then kill him like Luke and Han. Howevet\\, there was a golden opportunity for him to save the casino scene. There is not a terrible performance in the bunch\\, but the cast was thrown down a sarlacc of SJW multiculturalism and poorly communicated plot chains. It will literally make you feel as if every man in the film is a weak pitiful loser that has to learn a lesson from a woman to have any worth. Rey and Finn become not victims of a sith lord\\, but of a TERRIBLE story that tries to teach misguided Disney lessons.","true":true}
