Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a fan of the first game and someone that wasn't spoiled by the leaks I can can whole heartedly say I was not disappointed. Joel's death is not some pointless attempt at shock value as everyone wants to believe. Its creates interesting\\, reoccurring themes within the story (those being revenge\\, hate and forgiveness)\\, it gives Ellie a complex character arc\\, it kicks off a brutal journey for us the player to go on and is a perfect way to continue the story beats of the first game. Also I cried like a baby so there's that too.Abby is such an intriguing character and her tie to the first game was an amazing spin on the ending of the original. To be fair\\, her segment does go on too long but stick to it. Trust me you'll understand why you have to see Abby's perspective by the end. The only way I feel I can some up my feeling towards Abby's and her segment it that I said \\\"I don't want to kill Abby!\\\" aloud durring the final fight. Having her and Ellie's perspective is honestly what makes the ending as perfect as it is in my opinion.The only other complaints towards the game that I get are that it's not what was promised in the advertising (\\\"You think I'd let you do this in your own?\\\") and the time hopping mixed with flashbacks within flashbacks is messy.That said\\, I can't deny that I enjoyed it as much if not then slightly less than the first game. Slightly.Next gen looking graphics and a stellar score don't hurt the experience either.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
