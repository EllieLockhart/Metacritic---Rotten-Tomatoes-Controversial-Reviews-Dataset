Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw it for the first time. Still processing but as of now loved the beginning\\, liked the ending but the middle is a mixed bag. A lot of the Fin and Rose stuff will be skipped when watching the future Blu-ray. Will definitely be watching it again! (after second viewing I dropped my score to 3 stars due to not getting my awesome Luke moment. I'm a little bitter about it. Luke was my favorite growing up) ","true":true}
