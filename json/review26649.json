Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ok\\, for one\\, I liked the prequel trilogy\\, that being said\\, I was born in '91.  i was only alive for the remastered releases of some of the original movies.  if you hate the prequels\\, then by all means you probably wont like this\\, but if you appreciate the prequels for their story and added value\\, then this will make a good addition.","true":true}
