I have felt anger\\, discomfort\\, excitement\\, fear\\, empathy\\, sorrow and all the while\\, enjoying every second of it.\r\rBefore I pre-ordered this game\\, I was quite concerned by what people were talking about the story. So I made the tough decision of reading the leaks and finding out what happened. Once I got that out of the way\\, I went ahead and got the game on release. I started playing it with very critical eyes. I was prepared to hate the characters and the direction. Instead\\, I was disarmed and won over\\, a couple hours in. The performances and writing was masterful. I was instantly enthralled by the world I was thrown into. I had a lot of reservations about Abbey\\, until the last 10 hours of the game. I was pleasantly surprised by how it manages to shift your opinion of a woman who you are geared up for hating. A character that from the very beginning\\, is seen as a villain. You feel like a pendulum of emotions\\, as the game grinds to it's very emotional finale. I felt my own morale compass being put into question\\, as I felt guilty for siding with one character to the next. It was the kind of inward thinking that no game has ever evoked in me. And it's because of this\\, it's an undeniable masterpiece.\r\rThis game without a doubt\\, has the most intense and exciting gameplay I've ever enjoyed. It manages to make you feel vulnerable and powerless\\, while giving you about a hundred different ways to kill enemies. When you get a killing streak\\, with near perfect flow\\, it can be the most satisfying thing. It reminds me of Hotline Miami and the brutal\\, fast paced decisions you have to make\\, while running through an arena of enemies. The crafting and looting are almost identical to the first game\\, with a bit more depth. I have to admit\\, looting is not my favourite thing to do in any game\\, but it feels necessary in this case.\r\rI've played a lot of games through out the years and this one will probably stick with me for a long time. It's easily one of the best games I've ever played and I can't wait to jump back in for a second play though. My advice is to play this game\\, knowing as little as possible about it. Ignore the haters and enjoy this game for what it is! The PS4 was made for this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
