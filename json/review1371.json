Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A ruthless desecration of the Star Wars mythology\\, and a big middle finger to everything established in The Force Awakens and the OT. It takes so much \\\"creative freedom\\\" with everything established by previous installments of the saga\\, that it may actually jeopardize the careers of every actor involved in this movie. Filled with childish frat boy slapstick humor in scenes where there shouldn't be any\\, and pointless side stories that lead the audience nowhere. \\n\\nIt is astonishing to me that Rian Johnson was allowed to make this movie with nobody there to rein in his frat boy\\, autistic 12 year old humor. Mark Hamill\\, sir\\, if you ever read this\\, thank you for giving us the best joker\\, and the best versions of Luke Skywalker in the OT.  You sir\\, (and Oscar\\, and Daisy\\, and John\\, and Adam\\, and Carrie) deserved better than this steamy pile of shit they put you guys in. May the force be with you all. Half star for the music.","true":true}
