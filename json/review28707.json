Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Put me in the camp of Haters of this movie.  It is a LONG convoluted piece of crap.  There are so many questions it doesn't answer and we probably won't ever find out.  I'm a huge star wars fan and was thoroughly disappointed in this movie.  Carrie Fisher was terrible in her last performance.  It sounded like she had marbles in her mouth when talking.  The love story between Rose and Finn was so forced and silly.  There are a couple of nice scenes.  I did like R2-D2 and Luke meeting up and I really liked the Hyperdrive Kamikaze.  Like everyone else\\, I really was looking forward to this movie.  It just didn't deliver the goods.","true":true}
