Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson completely ruined a film franchise. and whats worse is that this movie has set up a divide amongst fans. Avid supporters of this film blame their own kind for defending their right to love a franchise and refuse to acknowledge the blatant plot holes and fan disservice. No amount of defense can hide the smear this film has had on the Saga as a whole and completely ruined this sequel trilogy and its characters potential. Awful\\, would rather watch Attack of the Clones on repeat. ","true":true}
