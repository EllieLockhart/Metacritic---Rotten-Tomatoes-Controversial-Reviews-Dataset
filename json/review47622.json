Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What was this movie? There's no logic. There's no gravity in space! Everyone was basically made into a fool than character buildup. Fight me Rian\\, but this was not a Star Wars movie. More or less\\, it's kind of like a Spaceballs movie gone political. The only good thing about this movie was that it was beautifully shot. That's why I didn't look at my phone throughout the duration of the film.","true":true}
