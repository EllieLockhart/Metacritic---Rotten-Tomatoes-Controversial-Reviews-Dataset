Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad\\, really disapponted and im glad i didnt have to pay for it. At least the prequals were a star wars story. This is some guys personal movie disquised as a star wars movie. Lucas should never have sold out. I am just stunned how bad this is. Luke was turned into an imasculated bed wetting hobo. All the male characters were pushed to the background to make roon for the true female heros. I cant go on because the more i think about it the more i get disgusted","true":true}
