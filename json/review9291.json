Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. This movie is garbage. The writers disregard establish norms of hoe this universe works for cheap visuals and even cheaper jokes that are inappropriate to the scene and setting. Subversion of audience expectations for the sole sake of subversion is not good writing. ","true":true}
