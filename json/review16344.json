Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm old enough to have been a 20 year old\\, in a long line\\, waiting for the opening of the Return of the Jedi\\, and found myself being interviewed by a TV channel. So I've been invested in this saga a very long time.\\nI get that every little detail matters to a lot of people.\\nBut what matters to me more is how I feel when the end credits roll\\, and the messages and morals and bits of wisdom tucked into the story. There are certainly more things I'd have liked to see\\, especially Luke training Rey in the Force.\\nBut when all was said and done\\, I loved Luke rising to the occasion\\, and projecting himself into the battle\\, sacrificing himself so everyone could get away. He was able to pass into the Force full of Peace.\\nThen we see the youngsters telling the legend of Luke\\, and you can see that that take was going to spread and bring life to the resistance.\\nAnd that left my heart full\\, and satisfied\\, and that's what matters to me.","true":true}
