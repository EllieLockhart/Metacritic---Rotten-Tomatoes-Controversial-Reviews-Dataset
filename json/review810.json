Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent addition to the film lineup. Lucas film has built a large universe around the current canon. Fans should definitely read the new canon novels to get a better understanding and depth to this film. Many of the \\\"plot holes\\\" people are complaining about are explained\/hinted at in books.","true":true}
