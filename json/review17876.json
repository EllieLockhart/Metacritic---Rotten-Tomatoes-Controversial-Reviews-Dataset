Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has been a week now since I saw episode 8\\, and the longer I think on it\\, the more I hate this movie. The director doesn't know how to tell a story\\, and waste many of his best characters. Disney has successfully ruined the Star Wars franchise\\, thanks Mickey. ","true":true}
