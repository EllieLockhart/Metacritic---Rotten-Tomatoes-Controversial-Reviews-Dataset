Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie butchered Luke's character making him a weening old man\\, and had an almost 45min sequence the Canto Bright ''adventure'' which felt like it was brought straight out of the prequels\\nthere was no development for the over all story or the characters during that side story- adventure which felt super unnecessary and boring\\nfinally the cuts and transitions from scene to scene where very poorly written  and constructed","true":true}
