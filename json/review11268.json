Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly the movie was \\\"okay\\\". This was a fine movie but this was a terrible Star Wars movie. The number of plot holes between Episode 7 and Episode 8 was just too many to make this a well-thought out movie. Luke say \\\" I came here to die.\\\" yet he made a map and hid it. This entire movie seemed like a waste of time and money. If you want an episode 8 with good storytelling\\, plot\\, good acting and good light-saber duels\\, GO WATCH the original trilogy or EVEN the prequels. Not impressed. The majority of this movie was very poor\\, but it was a Star Wars movie. A true disappointment.","true":true}
