Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An odd addition to the Star Wars saga\\, ostensibly a good movie with interesting plot points and impressive visuals spoiled by some unfortunate choices with direction\\, writing and off-beat humour. In any other series this would be a smash-hit movie\\, but as a Star Wars film it feels a little off.","true":true}
