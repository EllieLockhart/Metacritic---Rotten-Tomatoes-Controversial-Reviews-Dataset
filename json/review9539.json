Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good enough to see the obligatory one time just to feed your curiosity of seeing a new Star Wars movie. Lacks action\\, an interesting plot\\, and any new additions of a great story to the Star Wars universe. Sad!","true":true}
