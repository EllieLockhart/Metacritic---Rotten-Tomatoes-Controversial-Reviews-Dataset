Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a simple showcase of modern special effects. That's it. This movie is like a collection of Youtube Fan made short films. There is ZERO Star Wars substance here. Every question that you hoped would be answered is instead causally dismissed. Each character that you were eager to see developed were simply abandoned. There is no evidence of cohesion\\, or conscious thought given to the Star Wars universe\\, it's lore\\, or what has been built. Instead it is Star Wars only in name\\, and clearly it should NOT be permitted to use even that. ","true":true}
