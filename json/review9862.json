Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the Star Wars Universe stunning visuals and a submerging amount of alien life and creatures this Star Wars should be praised for its originality and ability to dive into the depths of the force and it's mysteries. Although I agree they could have not killed off some important characters well such as Star Wars that's been happeneing since Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace the fans who hate on this film just thought they knew exactly how it would play out and when it didn't go the way they wanted they all hated on it but does that really make it bad or just not what the fan boys wanted ? The movie has stunning twists that shocked even me with great action acting and dialogue it is a little long for a theater sitting but at home it'll be amazing ! Go see this one with an open mind it's in my Top three Star Wars films of all time !","true":true}
