{"101487":178635,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reviews are very mixed for this film\\, and I can understand why. If someone watches this film without watching or loving any other Star Wars film or the characters they may like it. But if\\, like me\\, you grew up with these films and have engaged with watching the characters' journey's over the years and spent time wondering what those characters journey's will be after Return Of The Jedi\\, you will be bitterly disappointed by this movie.\\nSpoilers ahead: the biggest gut punch that I can't get over is they have totally destroyed Luke Skywalker's character! Not only have they killed him off\\, but the Luke of George Lucas' films would never have done what Disney's concoction of Luke did here. He basically tries to murder his sister's son because he sensed some dark side in him\\, then when the son beat him in a fight Luke abandoned his friends and family and gave up on everything\\, cutting himself off from the force!\\nThis is the Luke who\\, in the original trilogy\\, never gave up and gave everything to save his father who was the evil Darth Vader! Even Mark Hamill in interviews was bitter about how they've written his character and argued with the director about it telling him they've got him completely wrong. I may have given it more stars but this character assassination is unforgivable.\\nLots of other problems\\, the other original characters are hardly in the movie\\, Chewbacca\\, R2D2 & CP30 are in it for about 10 seconds each. If you watch wanting to see them don't bother. They've even got the force wrong. Princess Leia gets blown into space then\\, by the force\\, is able to breathe and fly through space! That literally makes no sense and doesn't relate to any way the force can by used in any other SW movie.\\nShe then knocks on the outside door of a spaceship which someone opens and pulls her in\\, but they don't get sucked out into the vacuum of space. The physics are wrong. Not only would they get sucked out but in SW Episode 3\\, that very thing happens. So it's not consistent with the physics in the SW universe.\\nTalking of physics\\, they manage to drop bombs in space where there's no gravity. Again that isn't possible. Disney have tried some damage control by explaining the bombs were magnetic\\, but in that case they would have stuck to the ship they were coming out of!\\nAlso the main \\\"Jedi\\\" Rey has no character progression at all\\, no training from Luke\\, and no trials of any kind. Again this is the writers not understanding the SW universe where every Jedi has gone through trials and training\\, they're not just born with all the powers with perfect skill like Rey was. Luke & Anakin faced many trials over their time to test their character\\, and they both made mistakes. Anakin fell where Luke didn't.\\nRey was just born with all the Jedi powers\\, can fly any ship and use a lightsaber with no training. It doesn't make any sense. It's like the writers have never seen another SW film.\\nThere are other bad things with it too much to go into here. The only good thing about it is the action scenes are quite cool to watch. But not enough to give it more than regrettably one star. I say regrettably as I'm a life-long SW fan\\, loved all George's SW movies with their consistency\\, character progression and plot archs\\, but Disney are just ruining them now.","true":true}
