Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a right way to subvert expectations and there's a wrong way to subvert expectations. So many things just didn't make sense to me. The convenience of things\\, the bizarre choices made... I think it's safe to say that I was not transported into this universe at all - too many jarring things. Surprising twists... I mean just ONE example\\, if you could just kamikaze a starship into an entire fleet of enemies\\, why haven't they been doing this for the past thousand years in space battles? \\n\\nThe Force Awakens left me satisfied but this just completely threw me off the Star Wars franchise... I mean just look at what Mark Hamill has to say. It just sucks because I love Star Wars dearly. I find it bizarre that the tomatometer vs the audience score is so drastically different. But aye - trust the real critics yeah?","true":true}
