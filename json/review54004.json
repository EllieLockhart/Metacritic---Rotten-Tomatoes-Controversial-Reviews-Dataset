Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe the title refers to old school fans. We are the last Jedi. I get that Disney wants a universe after skywalker saga\\, but they could have given us a much better ending for our beloved characters and still kept their future agenda. Most likely the last Star Wars movie I will ever go to see on opening weekend and just wait to rent it one day on BluRay. I can\u2019t stress enough\\, don\u2019t waste your money and don\u2019t support this crap that has become the Star Wars universe. I agree that these movies are making the prequels look like masterpieces. Why is Darth Maul the only legitimate lightsaber fight we\u2019ve ever had? Hire the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon crew to give us some damn saber battles! ","true":true}
