Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent addition to the Star Wars franchise. Not predictable\\, and takes characters to a place where many didn't realize they needed to be taken in order to tell a more compelling story.","true":true}
