Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much like Obi-Wan\\, I feel betrayed. Admittedly it's my fault that I fell hook and line for the marketing and hype machine this time around\\, but this was not the Star Wars you were looking for. Thats not to say it's not an entertaining shiny spectacle\\, it certainly is\\, and if you come in with no expectations wanting just a good popcorn flick with plenty of humor peppered throughout like it's a Marvel movie then you'll love it. But for the fan who has consumed countless hours of previous franchise content\\, read the articles leading up to it\\, followed the news\\, and the marketing your likely to walk out with very mixed feelings. Previously set plot points resolve unsatisfactorily\\, convenient things happen along the way that contradict past films\\, unnecessary side plots that bog the pacing down\\, new characters in significant roles that were neither memorable or criticism\\, and the core storyline most came for\\, does not get nearly the attention it deserves considering the shear level of marketing attributed to it. And once again the villains aside from Kylo (who was much improved this go around) are rather one dimensional\\, glossed over and pushed to the background\\, despite being a good part of the marketing\\, toy push. On the upside the two legacy leads get more air time this go around\\, but still not as much as most will like. From the technical side of things\\, the effects\\, design\\, and sound are as to be expected by the franchise and the film settles in to its own aesthetic while maintaining much of what came before. Overall it's just an ok movie. Not great\\, not awful\\, but thoroughly disappointing. Saw it in IMAX 3D on a giant screen (not lie max as some call it) and the 3D seemed to be subpar\\, no aspect ratio shifting\\, additional footage on top or bottom\\, or visible uptick in quality as expected by a film shot with imax cameras. Save the extra ten bucks and see it in an RDX\/XD\/Dolby theather. ","true":true}
