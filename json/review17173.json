Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked the movie at first - from an entertainment point of view. It was pleasant to watch.  BUT - I went home and started thinking about it. The more I thought\\, the more I had to admit that the writers of the story line are absolute idiots! They have destroyed the Star Wars franchise\\, or rather\\, they have turned it into a joke. Seriously\\, how hard is it to write a coherent story line? I know that the books wandered off the mark as well\\, but how hard would it have been to manage the franchise even as you authorized books to be written. Anyway\\, I have to admit\\, THE ONLY WAY I COULD ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE (which I did) WAS BECAUSE I LONG AGO GAVE UP CARING ABOUT STAR WARS BEING ANYTHING WORTHY TO ADMIRE.","true":true}
