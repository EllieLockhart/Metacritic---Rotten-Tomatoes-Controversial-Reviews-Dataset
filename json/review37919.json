Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second best Star Wars movie ever made (You know what the best is). It may tie Rouge One for second place. I won't know until my second viewing. Great stories\\, huge surprises\\, and mush sadness.","true":true}
