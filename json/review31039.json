Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So good. Kylo Ren is one of the most interesting characters in all the films. The movies excel when they deal with the new characters. They stumble slightly when forcing nostalgia down your throat\\, but luckily they are moving more away from that. Go see it!","true":true}
