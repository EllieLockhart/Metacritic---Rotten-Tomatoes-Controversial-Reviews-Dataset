Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing the Last Jedi\\, I think I understand somewhat how people felt when The Phantom Menace was released. However\\, this is altogether different. Interviews with the cast from months back now finally make sense\\, especially how Mark Hamill's fundamentally disagree with everything about his character.\\nSpoilers now:\\nEvery single plot line in this story for the main characters lead to absolutely nothing of consequence except for Luke and Rey's\\, which is an absolute shame. Literally nothing would change in this movie if Finn wasn't present. -everything that the previous movie set up\\, well that's gone too.\\nVisually the movie looked fantastic\\, but visuals do not hold a movie together. Sorry director Rian Johnson\\, your handling of this beloved content was without any sense of respect. I'm not sure if he had a deep seeded distaste for Star Wars and its fans\\, but he certainly alienated all of the fans of the series. The worst part is\\, that with releasing this film Disney may have killed the Star Wars dream. So much good effort was put into this film\\, everything other than the writing and direction which were personally insulting. \\\"Forget everything that's happened before\\,\\\" really? The audience really needs to be told to forget everything that previously happened in Star Wars and not feel bad that it is being disrespected? So strange because the audience is buying the product precisely because of \\\"everything that's happened before\\\".","true":true}
