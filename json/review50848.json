Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold film\\, which dares to question the wisdom and rhythm of the entire saga thus far.  Even with familliar characters and tried familiar situations\\, we're taken far off course from the expected. We're in uncharted waters in the Star Wars universe for the first time\\, probably\\, since Return of the Jedi\\, which I find truly exciting.","true":true}
