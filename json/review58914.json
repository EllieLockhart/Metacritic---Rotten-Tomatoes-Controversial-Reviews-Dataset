Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is the only reason this game gets a rating higher than 1. There is no character development for the new characters and the ending is horrible. You play as Abby for ten hours which is way too long and Joel gets tortured to death in the first two hours of the game. The plot is a generic revenge is bad lesson. The game should not be as long as 20 hours\\, the first game wasn\u2019t near as long and it was perfect. ND tries to make you feel sympathy for Abby by revealing the surgeon from the first game as her father but it fails miserably. After you are done traveling 12 hours as Ellie to find Abby in Santa Barbara you don\u2019t even kill her\\, that would have been the perfect moment for a choice. When Ellie arrives back at the farm every one has left which makes the entire story pointless. They could have made the game so much better if they made Tommy die and Joel travels with Ellie for vengeance. At the end they confront Tommy\u2019s killer and the killer shoots at Ellie but Joel jumps in front of Ellie takes the bullet and shoots the killer. Joel\u2019s last dying breath would be I\u2019m sorry and Ellie would say I forgive you\\, (this is referencing the hospital). When Ellie arrives in Jackson everyone there is infected and Ellie has to kill everybody she once called family.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
