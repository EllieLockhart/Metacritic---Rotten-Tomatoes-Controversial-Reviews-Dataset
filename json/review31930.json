Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler free review. This Star Wars movie was different but definitely inspired by the original trilogy. There are certain events and reactions of the characters might be disappointing. This movie wrap up. Some questions that were left from force awakens and might in fact leave more questions to be answered. This really annoyed a lot of viewers which felt that it left plot holes. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with what people are saying but I do understand where they\u2019re coming from. As long as you don\u2019t walk into the movie thinking that all of your questions and you will be OK","true":true}
