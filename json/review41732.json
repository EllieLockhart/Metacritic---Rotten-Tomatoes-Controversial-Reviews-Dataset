Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't as terrible as others are saying\\, sure you have strong opinions on how terrible it is.  It was funny\\, it was thrilling.  It was a rollercoaster of emotion.  Sure there were a few problems\\, but the storyline was amazing!","true":true}
