Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WORST STAR WARS EVER!!! Yes I put that in all caps to make my point as strongly as possible. This movie has been criticized from start to finish and for good reason. If you think anything about this movie is staying true to Star Wars lore and characterization you are seriously mistaken. This seems like a movie for people who have never seen a Star Wars movie before. Only it isn't. It needs to fit within the established universe and it clearly does not. How this movie got made is beyond me.","true":true}
