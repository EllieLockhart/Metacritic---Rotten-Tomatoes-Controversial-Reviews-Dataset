Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was probably the most intense Star Wars film I've ever seen. Definitely an improvement over TFA. Lots of action-packed scenes and surprises. Was surprised to see Leia actually use the force for possibly the only time. Snoke and Phasma shouldn't have been killed off this early as they had so much potential. Overall\\, though\\, I loved it and should really make Episode IX interesting. Oh\\, and the porgs were just too adorable :P","true":true}
