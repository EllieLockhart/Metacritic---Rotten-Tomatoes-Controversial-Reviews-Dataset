Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I though this movie explained a lot of things that happened in \\\"A New Hope\\\". The actors did a very nice job at bringing out the good and bad in both the good and bad sides. It really showed a side of Star Wars that you have never seen before\\, and added a moment of reality check to an overall unrealistic saga. The film brought out different emotions\\, and really showed how everyone can be right and wrong at different times. This movie really made you feel as if you are a bystander watching the action from above. As I look back at everything that happened in the film\\, I realize how many Easter eggs and clues they hit within the film. Make sure to look out for those within the film\\, and I would suggest this for anyone who really enjoys a good movie\\, good explanations\\, and great emotions and actors.","true":true}
