Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film particularly does not have a \\\"correct rating\\\". People say you either love it or hate it\\, however for me it withholds both elements which balance it out for me to just say it is a good movie. When I first saw this movie I was a little disappointed however I left feeling shocked and a feeling I hadn't really felt after watching any other movie in theaters. This movie is unique\\, has its really high highs but also pretty low lows. The biggest complaint I have is the subplot that takes up too much screen time and is a very painful segment of the movie. However\\, looking at this movie as a whole\\, I enjoyed it and am at peace with it.","true":true}
