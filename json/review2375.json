Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A two and a half hour movie where nothing of significance happens. It may be fun for the younger generation but I suspect most older fans will be rather put out. I am reminded of a line from Superman II \\\"Superman didn't even do anything!\\\"","true":true}
