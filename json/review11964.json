Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huh\\, what did I just see?  This movie feels like Disney is digging into the franchise.  I just re watched the force awakens and was excited for this one but left the theater disappointed after watching The Last Jedi.\\n\\nIt just had that Disney touch to it. We all knew it would happen. The Rebels play out like a corporate HR ad.  \\n\\nIt's just so \\\"Everybody is a winner\\\" vibe that makes it feel like trash.   Meh!","true":true}
