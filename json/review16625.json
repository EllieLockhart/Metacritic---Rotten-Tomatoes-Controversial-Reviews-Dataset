Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible to say the least. I feel the hate for this movie comes from the people that already had in their minds the way they wanted to story to go. They hated The Force Awakens for being unoriginal\\, now they hate The Last Jedi for taking the series in an unexpected direction. Rian took a risk\\, a risk he had to take. I love the direction he chose to take Luke. I love the performances that Rian was able to draw from the actors. I'm excited to see what he does with his own trilogy\\, and I am very excited to see how JJ finishes off the sequel trilogy. This might not be the star wars movie some people wanted\\, but to those going in with an open mind you are in for a treat.","true":true}
