Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time seeing it I hated it because of the way it handled some characters and 3D distracted me from being able to follow the movie but after 2nd viewing in 2D\\, I love the movie\\, I'm over everything I disagreed with. I ugre everyone to see it again if they didn't like it. Only the Casino scene seems pointless and boring.","true":true}
