Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cool special effects but ruined through horrible writing and huge plot holes that are not consistent with the Star Wars universe.  Movie is too long with subplots that literally have NO effect on the story whatsoever and drag a bad story down even more.  It's almost like watching 2 bad movies at the same time\\, topped of with crazy disrespectful treatment of beloved characters for good measure.  And i truly truly wanted to love this movie so bad.  Very disappointing.","true":true}
