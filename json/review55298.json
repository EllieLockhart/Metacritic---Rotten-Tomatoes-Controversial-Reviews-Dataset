Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lets put it this way : \\nThe visuals \\, the cinematography and the sound was fucking great. \\nthe rest ? utter shit. the luke story totally  totally ignores the actual luke character we known for 3 movies\\, books \\, and a few games. rey is essentially more powerful then anikin or sidious ever have been WITHOUT TRAINING ! she literally is like. let put it this way\\, she didnt know about the force like days ago. and now can split mountains and have visions and shit right a fucking way. \\nthe force got totally made up on the fly. like it makes no sense. but fuck it . \\nteleportation is teleportaion . fuck it. \\nah . and snoke just does. that epic fucking badass dark force user\\, who was all the epic mystery. just dies. he has 10 min of screen time. \\noh yeah. the first few slapstick homour scenes ? pretty much force awakens. \\nbut after that its gets to the point where its just cringy as fuck. \\nalso fuck the casino part. its dumb. pointless. like phasma. and other shit in this movie. half of the movie is irrelevant to the actual plot and characters. \\nalso rey and kylo swap motivations and characters so much in this movie it gives you brain damg. \\n\\nall in all. i walked out after snokes death . said fuck you movie and left. the 1 and a half stars for the visuals and sound.","true":true}
