Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually striking and it's great to see Luke return to the new trilogy. However the amount if issues in this movie outweighed the pros I just mentioned. This film was a mess\\, not a lot of the decisions made sense\\, pacing was bad\\, useless new characters\\, unfit humor\\, and nothing was accomplished in the end. These are just to name a few.","true":true}
