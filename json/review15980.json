Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made a Rotten Tomatoes account to give my two cents on this disaster of a movie. I'll start with what I enjoyed. It was visually stunning ....beautiful movie. Porgs are 99% more likeable than Jar Jar Binks and every Ewok ever. What makes this movie terrible is that Rey is a Mary Sue to the max ....please google the meaning of Mary Sue ...(spoiler its not an anti feminist term and it applies to all genders\/sex). Rey displays powers and abilities fully unearned. I knew Luke was going to die at some point and that it was necessary but what Rian Johnson did to Luke's character and the way he died was the biggest slap in the face to the entire franchise and its fans. Mark Hamill expressed this several times\\, he's since back tracked under what I assume is pressure from the 4th Reich (Disney). I really feel bad for J.J. Abrams and wish him the best of luck in dealing with the raging dumpster fire that is the current state of the Star Wars Universe. Rian Johnson ...please don't ruin any more Star Wars movies.","true":true}
