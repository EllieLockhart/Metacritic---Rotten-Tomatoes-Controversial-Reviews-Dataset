Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not my luke skywalker.  these people couldnt have survived in my house growing up let alone a galactic empire hell bent on domination.  stop drinking the fluoride riddled water and the soy based milk.  stop being brain washed by the universities that hire professors who have been indoctrinated into this poor them mentality which only weakens the people who most need inspiration and a swift kick in the ass instead of a poor you better luck next time.  may the universe have mercy on your poor souls.   On the bright side this ;movie will usher in a new generation of jobs like the pecker checker  attendant in public restrooms so we can figure out what gender you are and give you a tag to hang on your stall.","true":true}
