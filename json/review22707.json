Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like the Episode VII\\, this is another \\\"remake\\\" of The Return of The Jedi mixed with some of The Empire Strikes Back. This movie is bad\\, slow\\, with characters that are totally unnecessary for the movie\\, nonsense scenes\\, absurd dialogues\\, and a long list of nonsense things that have ruined this legendary saga even more than with Episode VII. Congratulations Disney\\, you bunch of incompetents.","true":true}
