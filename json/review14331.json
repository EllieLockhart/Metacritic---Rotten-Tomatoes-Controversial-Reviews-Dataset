Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with the original trilogy\\, was disappointed with the prequels\\, but am baffled by the new trilogy.  Arguably\\, Abrams inaugurated the new series with a \\\"shank\\\" into left field by unimaginatively rehashing Episode IV\\, pining for \\\"A New Hope\\\" instead of a new story.  Rian Johnson\\, perhaps intentionally or not\\, \\\"tossed over his shoulder\\\" like a discarded lightsaber\\, the plot elements and everything else Abrams had set up\\, along with\\, either accidentally or otherwise\\, sacred notions of Star Wars lore and legend.  The resulting milieu reduces the best hope of the Galaxy and archtypical Good Hero - an inspiration and hope in the real world for a generation - into a disillusioned grumpy space-hermit who drinks unpasteurized blue milk from a lounging alien giraffe\\, and scowls rather than mentors.  \\n\\nJohnson takes us on a pointless circular sojourn with the story's too-many main protagonists in which there is no growth and no consequences.  For something that's supposed to be new\\, there's a tired feel that ends up exhausting the audience as well.  Why are all the old protagonists and heros still fighting the same battles in the same ships against the same star destroyers thirty years later?  \\n\\nDespite so many plot elements being essentially the same\\, what came across as jarringly different was the degree of racial and gender diversity in the Star Wars universe.  While expressing such sentiments in this regard is highly unpopular today\\, I do so because this element\\, in my opinion\\, was so distracting it took me out of the movie and made me question the essential believability of the story (despite being sci-fi).  I expect most of the Empire (First Order) to be older white men with English accents.  When they're not\\, I notice it. When the Republic (Resistance?) is a rainbow of races with all of the top military ranks from leader to admiral to general to third and fourth in command all women as well\\, it again simply takes me out of the story.  This may be hailed as \\\"progress\\\" by Disney or Kathleen Kennedy\\, but long time fans will see this as a \\\"disturbance in the force\\\" and rebel against the brand - not because we're sexist or racist - but because the sudden shift in the composition of the universe strikes us as unbelievable and \\\"forced\\\".  And the one thing people want to do is to believe in Star Wars.  \\n\\nUltimately\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" badly misfired its blaster for a host of reasons\\, instead of relying on the elegance and chivalry of a laser sword\\, I mean lightsaber. Basic\\, relatable story-telling is the main reason in addition to replacing men with warrior-women.  The result is a 2-dimensional\\, unrealistic feeling universe that fails to inspire its older\\, core audience.","true":true}
