Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as if the people who wrote and directed this movie never saw a Star Wars movie\\, including the Force Awakens.  Just a truly awful movie.  Pretty much kills the franchise - in the future I'm pretty sure people will consider the 'Star Wars' movies to just be the first six (the prequels might have been 'meh' - but this was awful and ignores things like continuity\\, plot\\, logic\\, and tone.  I'd give it zero stars if that were possible. Half a star is because the music was Star Wars-esque.","true":true}
