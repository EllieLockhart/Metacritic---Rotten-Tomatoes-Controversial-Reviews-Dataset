Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hear this movie gets better upon a second viewing\\, and I haven't done that yet. But my initial reaction was one of indifference. I enjoyed the acting\\, some of the action sequences were thrilling\\, the cinematography was wonderful. But Johnson's script was sorely lacking.\\n\\nI didn't mind some of the major decisions regarding Luke\\, Rey's parentage\\, etc. My biggest issue with the script was the lack of context and the lack of world building. A lot of the issues stem from The Force Awakens. What is the First Order? What was the New Republic\\, and why did it matter? Who is Snoke? What is the Resistance resisting if there's a New Republic? This movie lacked vital exposition. Because of that\\, it came off like a Fast and the Furious or Transformers movie. It's flashy\\, with cool action sequences and lots of style. But there's zero emotional weight\\, because you don't know why anything matters. That's the real issue with this script.\\n\\nIf Abrams is able to do some world building to answer these questions in episode IX\\, it'll make all the difference. If that happens\\, my opinion of this film would change retroactively. As of right now\\, it's just okay.","true":true}
