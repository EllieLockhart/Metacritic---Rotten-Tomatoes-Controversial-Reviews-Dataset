{"101487":175591,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-04","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi might as well be called \\\"Revenge of the Feminist Agenda.\\\"\\nThat's because throughout TLJ the men are given short-shrift in many glaring ways.\u00a0\\nInstead of letting men be heroes and leaders they are generally treated as: 1) reckless kids (like Poe) that need their 'mommy' to protect them from themselves (also Rose saving Finn from a suicidal run)\\, 2) the source of all evil and conflict (Ren\/Snoke\/Codebreaker) because of their unbound desire to control everything 3) jaded and unheroic (Luke)\\, and require women to remind them of their duty and ideals (but only insofar as they are kept on a tight leash - aka Poe and Finn - so as not to do too much damage) 4) cold\\, harsh\\, purely functional and as sterile as the structures they create (i.e the First Order ships and bases)\\, so much so that the even require women to conform to that by hiding their essential qualities to fit in and get be part of their world (Captain Phasma)\\, and 5) pathetic losers who need women to humanize them\\, and if they can't\\, they are clearly lost causes so who needs them (Rey and Kylo teaming up to fight Snokes guards\\, though she fails to redeem him\\, hence affirming he is truly beyond hope).\\nThis is the essence of the movie. The other essence is 'yeah let's blow stuff up and turn every bit of canon on its head cause the actors playing the old guys won't be around much longer anyways. Besides any hint of traditional heroism among a \\\"band of brothers\\\" fighting and dying for a real cause is not cool in the brave\\, new Feminist\\, dingbat world we want to shove down everyone's throat.'\u00a0\\nThat pretty much explains the movie and why I think so many are miffed at it. Luke is not Luke. He's a self-loathing\\, miserable old codger whose ideals have been crushed. He's broken\\, and utterly defeated in ways his daddy could not have hoped for in even at his most evil. \\nIn short\\, Luke (played brilliantly by Mark Hamil\\, in arguably the best performance by ANY actor in the Star Wars Universe) is like the ideology he once held up so high but now has decided to trash. Like him\\, the Jedi have become old\\, depressing and irrelevant. They no longer fit into the 'universe\\,' and might as well be tossed out on to a remote island where they can simply die or fade away.\\nThat's also the problem. Hamil's wonderful performance as this version of Luke so VERY DEPRESSING\\, you almost want to pull a Jedi Mind Trick on him to get him out of this funk..or run him through with a light saber yourself! \\nTo top it off\\, just when you think the old\\, idealistic Luke has finally found a shred of hope and has come to save the day...he doesn't. Then he ingloriously\\, even unsympathetically\\, just fades away into nothing; leaving the viewer to wonder if there is ANY real hope left for the 20 or so survivors of a once-powerful fleet\\, who almost laughingly still call themselves ' The Resistance.'\\nThat's the real joke here. Normally the audience would feel inspired and determined; ready to cheer on the Rebels and say 'yeah push on\\, fight on.' But because of how decimated they are\\, it's almost comical to believe that this tiny group could do any more than run away\\, like a guy who got his ass handed to him after a bar fight!\u00a0\\nRemember\\, NO ONE came to help them in their hour of need. They barely get away from a re-energized First Order at the end (with Ren now firmly in charge). There is no 'fleet' to run too\\, either\\, as Luke and Leia were able too at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. Indeed there is quite literally NOTHING but a few guys on a tiny ship zipping away.\\nMaybe director Rian Johnson didn't intend for this ending to be so VERY DARK but it is. He's burned down the house\\, ripped out the foundations and took out the key pillars. And from this we are supposed to ... what? Be 'inspired?' There is NOTHING LEFT to be inspired about! It's a slaughter\\, a mess\\, a hopeless mess.\u00a0\\nEven Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\\, left the audience with hope\\, regardless of whether we knew about the events of a New Hope or not. After all\\, at the end of that movie there is still a credible and organized 'resistance' around which others can rally\\, and to legitimately carry on the fight even as the main characters (and most of the rebels) have been killed.\\nYou don't get that at all at the end of TLJ. Instead you get the sense there is NOTHING LEFT to base any hope on at all. The \\\"new\\\" Empire of the First Order has won. Ren is 'emperor' in all but name\\, with Hux as his now-humbled minion and chief suck up (played with apparent glee\\, bordering on almost comic delight\\, by the wonderful Domhnall Gleeson).\\nThis is the other essence of the movie; utter hopelessness and despair. Sure\\, it might be 'real life' in that we all get crushed and experience defeat. But even in the darkest places a man or woman may find themselves\\, most will still find enough hope or reason to carry on; if only because living is better than dying (attractive (and tragic) as it may seem to some\\, at times).\\nThis NOT\\, however\\, why a guy goes to see a Star Wars movie. He goes to have his hopes restored. He goes to watch the good guys save the day. He goes to have his ideals affirmed. He goes to see the underdog\\, with a good heart\\, triumph over the selfish\u00a0guy with a bad one. In effect the guy going to a Star Wars movie goes to see the mean school bully (finally) get his comeuppance at the hands of the 'nerd' who only wanted to be left alone in peace but is now forced to become a hero.\\nRian Johnson didn't give us that. Unlike Ren\\, he didn't just want the past to 'die\\,' or 'kill it\\,' he put a stake right through it; so thoroughly in fact that it's almost impossible to see how it can rise again...or even if it should?\\nEither way it's understandable people might hate him and even this movie for it. Is it a good movie? YES. But it is NOT the movie we\\, the fans\\, wanted.\u00a0\\nThat's the final essence of TLJ and its biggest secret\\, which is only revealed at the end. The fact is\\, this is not a \\\"Star Wars\\\" move; heck\\, it's barely a 'movie' at all. What it is is the cinematic equivalent of cataclysmic volcanic eruption; one that has almost completely buried the past and left a vast\\, empty\\, almost uninhabitable landscape in its wake. \\nMaybe \\\"life\\\" can still find a way to grow upon the barren landscape it has left behind. Or maybe it can't; that's the one great question this movie leaves unanswered.\\nStill if anyone can find a way to bring this series to a fulfilling conclusion it is JJ Abrams\\, who is preparing to direct Episode IX. To paraphrase Princess Leia 'this our most desperate hour. You're our only hope.'\\nWe'll see!","true":true}
