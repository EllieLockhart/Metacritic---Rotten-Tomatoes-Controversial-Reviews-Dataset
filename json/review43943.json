Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was great!  Lifetime fan of the series\\, read much of the now defunct EU.  There were some choices I didn't agree with totally\\, but I think Johnson did a terrific job of setting up the series for future installments.  Will see it again over the holidays for sure.\\nI think the best thing about this movie is that it isn't a re-tread of past episodes.  After TFA basically re-created ANH\\, I have to admit I was a little worried this would be a re-tread of TSB.  Thankfully\\, it wasn't!","true":true}
