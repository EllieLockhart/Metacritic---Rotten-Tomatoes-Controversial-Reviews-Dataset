Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This sequel in the third trilogy was very well made. The characters and places invoke strong imagery that enhances the film. However\\, it is best to see this movie after you have seen all of the previous Star Wars movies.","true":true}
