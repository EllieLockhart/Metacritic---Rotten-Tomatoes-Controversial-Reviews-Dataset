Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Beautiful symbolism and imagery\\, interesting storylines and theme. I like that they explore elements and dive deeper into the world of star wars\\, building upon the force awakens and developing the characters. Lots of good messages from the story too about hope and self-worth. Like everyone else after TFA I was trying to figure out who Rey was related to but after initially being surprised by the direction chosen for Rey's backstory I actually prefer it. What a great message that you don't have to be related to someone famous or important for you to be powerful yourself\\, to have worth\\, to matter. A bold innovative take on the star wars universe that remains true to its core themes of hope and redemption.","true":true}
