Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. You no longer need to be trained in the Jedi ways or how to use the force\\, simply turn on a light saber and you already qualify as a Jedi master. Princess Leia is able to survive deep space with no oxygen and flys like supergirl. I was hoping Disney would expand on the original story line and  leads us down an interesting creative path. Instead\\, they have about 16 rebels left and a stable boy who is probably already a Jedi grand master.","true":true}
