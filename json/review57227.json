Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie destroyed the legacy or Luke Skywalker and seemingly made up new rules for the force whenever it deemed it necessary to move the plot forward (Liea scene). The movie is bad in my opinion because it seems scared to commit to anything. Rey could be good or bad\\, leia could be dead or alive\\, luke lived or no wait maybe he should die. It trying to be radical is just cheap drama and bad writing. BUT there is one redeemer KYLO REN. Man did that actor kill it\\, and the writing was finally on point. He committed\\, he IS BAD. He might be conflicted emotional young man\\, but that comes out in all the ways it should in a powerful character who WANTS to be the villain. I LOVED every scene with his character. But thats all I loved. This being said it wont stop us all from seeing the next one\\, so\\, carry on Disney\\, carry on.","true":true}
