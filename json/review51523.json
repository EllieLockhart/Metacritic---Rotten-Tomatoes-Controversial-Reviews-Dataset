Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete mess of a movie. It cuts ties with every burning question you had from episode 7 with no consequences. Takes Star Wars in a ridiculous and over-gaudy direction\\, while simultaneous leaving you right where you started.... what a disappointment.","true":true}
