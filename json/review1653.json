Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie it fails on following fundamental plot guidelines for building suspense and interest towards a climax.  As a Star Wars store it fails horribly at ignoring the cliffhangers from the previous movie\\, and for having the characters things against their character and against Star Wars canon.  After being a Star Wars fan my entire life\\, episode 8 is causing me to lose interest in the characters\\, the force and the plot.","true":true}
