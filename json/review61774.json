New gameplay mechanics that creates new ways of approaching the game. Game starts at a slow phase but then it gets much more faster and smoother. Environment details are incredible just as interaction with them. Cutscenes are the best what we could have ever seen and I am almost losing sight if this is still a game or real life cutscenes. As before the music made by Gustavo Santoalalla is just emotional and fits perfectly. Enemies are smart\\, well not as smart as on E3 in 2018 but a really good one. There is no multiplayer in the launch of the game but they say it will be there soon.  Ofcourse the bigger problem is the story. More specificly the way it is delivered. I do not see a problem with the decisions and the story how it was made. Bigger problem is how it was written. It almost seems like a huge pile of mess laying on each other. Just as everyone I am not a big fan playing as the second main character (we all know what she has done) but I must say that it was much more cinematic and funnier experience then playing as Ellie(because playing as Ellie you play in bigger environments). The problem is that they want to make us sympathize us with this character but they do a **** work with that. Also I do not see a problem with the characters and the way they were written. Just the way the game presents them and the way how the developers wants you to see them. Like for instance the charachter that looks exactly the same way like directer Neil Druckmann looks like. This character is the way how I imagine a person that when you would saw them you would burn them to crisps if you would have the chance but the developers for some reason wants you to see him in a good light. Why? I do not know. No one knows. And the same goes for a lot of characters. The last thing is the ending and oh my god I have never seen so long ending since the RDR2 but you know what is the difference? In RDR2 the ending is 4 times longer but is much more satisfying than this. Over all I do not think this game deserves this reviews. For me it is solid 8\\,5\/10 but because of the reviews I choose 9 instead of 8.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
