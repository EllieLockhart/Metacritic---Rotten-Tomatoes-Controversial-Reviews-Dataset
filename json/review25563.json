Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a bad movie as far as bad movies go. As for my expectations of this film\\, i was greatly dissapointed by the end credits. it abruptly shut the door on the previous story and it sabotaged the luke skywalker character. in the force awakend i was extremely interested in these new characters. in the last jedi they could have died and would have been cool. I just did not care. this movie did not sell itself well enough.","true":true}
