Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a fan of Star Wars for over 20 years. This movie wrecked the entire idea of what Star Wars is. Iconic leads in the story aretotally out of character. Misplaced \\\"jokes\\\"\\, unfinished storylines\\, non sensical character deaths. This movie not only told a poor continuation but it disrespected everything presented in the originals and destroyed the storyline from the force awakens. I will never recommend or watch this movie again. Life long fans will be severely disappointed.","true":true}
