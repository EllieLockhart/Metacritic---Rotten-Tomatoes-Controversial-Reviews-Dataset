Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"todo es demaciado fantasioso se que es una pelicula de StarWars pero es que ya no les importa si tiene sentido la pelicula solo quieren vender el nombre como si no hubiera ma\u00f1ana\\, como Rey adquiere habilidades como si estuviera en la Matrix y le cargaran un programa para ser Maestro Jedi no les importa nada a los escritores ni directores ni mucho menos a esa productora.","true":false}
