Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I ended up really liking it\\, I think what is putting people off is some more complex and negative story lines going on here.  It's also a bit long\\, but saying that I'm hoping for a directors version that adds a few explanations... I thought it had a really good mix of action along with more thoughtful elements.","true":true}
