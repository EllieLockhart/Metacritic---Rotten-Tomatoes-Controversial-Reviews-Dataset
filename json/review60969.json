There are several moments in the story that simply do not pass the common sense test of human interaction.1. When Joel is killed his death is because he told a stranger his name after helping them. This is the same Joel who knew that he was a wanted man based on the actions he took in the hospital in the previous game. Our paranoid Joel was now either foolish or naive something not fitting with all his actions up to that point. This stranger(Abby) then killed him as she was hunting him. 2. Playing as Abby: Shortly after Joel meets his untimely end you play a stretch as her which doesn\u2019t make much sense\\, you don\u2019t want to identify with her you just want to see her dead because she destroyed a character that we got to see shattered just to be built up again. 3. The ending: Ellie goes on a quest to avenge Joel and at the end when it\u2019s time to kill Abby and avenge the man who meant so much to you\\, ya just stop and let her leave. The person who took so much from you\\, that you killed so many just to get a shot at her now you let walk free. Particularly when you are drowning her\\, with all that adrenaline pumping through her veins you mean to tell me that despite every chemical in her body telling her to kill that somehow she had a moment of altruistic clarity. The crackhead at my local gas station knows that just doesn\u2019t add up.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
