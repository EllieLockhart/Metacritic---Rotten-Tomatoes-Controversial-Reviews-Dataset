Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've had a think about the direction Disney has taken the latest Star Wars movie and I wanted to see The Force Awakens several times and Rogue One many times as well - but The Last Jedi - once is enough. I've been trying to work out why\\, and I think it is because Disney has now moved this movie and the last one away from what Star Wars really is. I reckon Disney is writing the scripts to make sure they can make offshoots and side stories rather than making films as artwork - like George Lucas did. There are too many questions rather than answers after The Last Jedi and now their writing has put them in a dilemma\\, kept alive someone who is dead and killed off someone who is alive.","true":true}
