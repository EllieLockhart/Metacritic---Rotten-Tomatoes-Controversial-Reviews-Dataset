Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. RJ totally disregarded TFA. Who's Smoke\\, how did he seduce Ben\/Kylo\\, how did they meet\\, where did he come from...doesn't matter to RJ. Parentage of Rey\\, either lied to us or the most awkward way of telling us. Constantly he tried to lead us to believe something was going to happen only to change it to say haha. They weren't twist\\, just deliberate rug pulls. The humor was a snarky copy of the MCU. Star Wars used funny characters in the past to bring color\\, C3PO and Han\\, now it's one liners. Oh and Snoke's throne room looked like it's sole purpose was to be a Lego set. In fact much of the scenery looked taylored to make merchandising easier. Thanks Disney!","true":true}
