Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually we are getting spoiled with the awesome CGI.   The story however is a disappointment.  The new characters are great but the overall arc story has been bastardized by Disney's desire to keep making movies.  Luke is the key character in all of this and his likability took a hit in this movie.  This series was about the Skywalkers and now it feels like they don't care based on the character assassination.  Why not end this the way it should have been ended and then move on to new stories.  For example\\, I thought Rouge One was wonderful and it didn't cause any issues with the Skywalker saga.   This was just wrong on so many levels.","true":true}
