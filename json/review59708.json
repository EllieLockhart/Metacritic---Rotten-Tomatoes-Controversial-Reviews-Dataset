Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Where to begin\\, let's get the obvious out of the way first they killed Joel whoever came up with that suggestion in the meeting at naughty dog needs to be fired anyone who agreed needs to be fired.Then they go on and treat his death like we hadn't already played a previous game for 30+ hours or more depending on how many times you played through the first game. By making him out to be a bad guy for what he did.That's lazy writing because the reason this Abby character kills Joel is because her dad was one of the doctors that was going to kill Ellie in the first game.Naughty dog can't punish you for a choice that you had to make in the first game which everyone was in board with by the way cause eveyione fell in love with Joel and Ellie relationship and then in this game it punishes you by killing Joel. Like that is bad writing we are being punished for something we had no choice against.The game makes you sit through half the run time playing as Abby helping her friends out when you already have seen playing as Ellie that they all die anyway so why would we feel any suspense when we are going around with them we know there not going to die because we know how they die\\, there is just no reason. In to why we would feel the need to invest ourselves in her story arc.Naughty dog shows you what happens then makes you play the scenes leading up to it however these \\\"scenes go on for half the game\\\" it was such a waste of time.Also the final nail in the coffin for me was when the game forces you to beat up Ellie to near death as Abby WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO That Ellie is not the bad guy why are we being forced to play as this unlike ale terrible and horrible person.This review is all over the place and pretty much a rant so I know I've missed out a lot of things it would take forever to pick this game apart and why it was the biggest let down ever and how it has single handndley ruined and entire franchise for me I can't even play the first one anymore because naughty dog has destroyed this story so much. It pains me because I use to love these characters or at least Joel and Ellie but know ones dead and the other one destroyed I just can't with this game franchise anymore congratulations naughty dog you have killed one of your most popular franchises absolutely disgraceful.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
