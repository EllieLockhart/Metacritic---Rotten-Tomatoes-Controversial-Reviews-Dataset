Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As the film ended\\, I could only think about how empty the movie was and how hard it tried to be more than that. Everything about it\\, from the pointless plot twists to the shallowness in Rays training was disappointing. In episode 2 no one cared if the droids killed the clones or the clones killed the droids but at least the main characters and their experiences still meant something. As bad and corny as Anakin seemed\\, it was still a love story\\, and the beautiful and creative setting actually made it feel worthwhile. In this movie\\, everything in it\\, including the story and the characters felt as sterile and pointless as the clone war scenes in episode 2. The soul of the movie\\, which should be about learning the ways of force and the struggle to do good was expressed shallowly and halfheartedly. Ray once again is instantly all powerful (maybe because she is a woman?)\\, her training with Luke was a joke and whatever he did teach her sounded like a watered down version of the nature worshipping religious beliefs of Avatar. Furthermore\\, the above mentioned parts of the movie along with all the complaints Rose had about the rich people in the casino\\, the newly appointed lady general who makes apparent the foolishness of the alpha guy pilot Poe and Chewy turning vegan make this movie feel like political propaganda more than a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
