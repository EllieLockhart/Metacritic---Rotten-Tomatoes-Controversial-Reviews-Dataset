Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first 20 minutes of this movie were an insult to the franchise\\, and not much better than the prequels.  In the opening battle scene\\, before establishing any kind of flow or continuity in the story\\, they were making self-deprecating jokes.  The First Order just seems hokey and unbelievable.  How did the entire resistance fall apart so quickly?  All of the promise of compelling backstories in the Force Awakens was lost on this movie -- Snoke just dies without any kind of explanation for who he was.  There's very little detail about how Luke loses control of Kylo Ren.  Admiral Ackbar's death is almost an afterthought.  They need to stop catering so much to the 10 and under crowd.  After this one\\, I'm sorry to say\\, they may just need to just stop making these movies.","true":true}
