Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pay NO attention to the bitter\\, self important trolls who expect us to believe a half star rating is fair. Seriously?! I see every 10th reviewer on Flixster exerting their unreasonable opinion power. Not 1 or 2 or 2.5?? These idiots bring the majority of the 3-5 star reviews way down. They honestly are so angry at the world and bitter that they want us to believe that this is one of the worst films ever made??? Jerks! They value their own opinions over reasonable fairness. Keep in mind that professional movie critics give it a 95.","true":true}
