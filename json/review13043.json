{"101487":130888,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't hate this move.  But\\, there are things in this movie I hate.  I've seen this film 5 times.  3 times in less than 24 hours on opening night\/day.  It gets better after the 2nd viewing but that's only because I knew when to cringe or go to the bathroom.  3 minutes in to the 1st viewing I turned to my wife and said \\\"what the hell is this\/\\\"  Can you hear me now jokes in Star Wars!!!!  Then we get to Princess Poppins.  Without a doubt the WORST scene in ANY Star Wars movie.  This could have been done in a way that didn't make people laugh.  And that what I heard\\, laughter.  Up next\\, Maz and the union dispute.  Not needed.  Her castle\/watering hole of over 1000 years was just destroyed and in less than 48 hours she's fighting  in a union dispute?  Just dumb.  Canto Bight.  The whole Finn and Rose dialog about sticking it to the man  and riding the horse like creatures was unnecessary and stupid.  For me the biggest problem is what they did to Luke.  Sorry\\, its just not what the character would have become.  It is what it is but I don't like it.  With that said\\, there are lots of things to like about Last Jedi and I'd see it again.","true":true}
