Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"lack cohesion to the other 2 movies in the series. the story is a mess\\, the writing is horrible. this is a too lack of plot planning and character development. shows a profound lack of understanding in multi movie planning\\, the star wars universe and pacing of events. shame on you","true":true}
