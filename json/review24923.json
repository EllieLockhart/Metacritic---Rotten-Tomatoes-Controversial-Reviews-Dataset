Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My first impression of the first half of the movie was not to good. There are lots of wtf moments and cringy jokes and plot twists. The second half was a little bit  better but still left me asking \\\"why?\\\". It was really all over the place and uninteresting in some points. They didn't go into depth at all with most of the characters back stories and they really played it safe throughout the film. There were some good action scenes that I enjoyed which is why I give it a decent enough score. This is definitely not my favorite star wars and I am worried about it's future as well as my interest anymore. Disney\\,  ya fd it up.","true":true}
