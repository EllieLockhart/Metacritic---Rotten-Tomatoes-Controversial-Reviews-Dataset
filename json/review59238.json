I found myself pushing through it just to finish it. There is nothing here to keep you hooked and you don\u2019t feel attached  to the game like you would if you play the first one. I played the first game through 4 times and still play the multiplayer. I will never play Part 2 again and I am upset that they profited off me buying it.","true":true}
