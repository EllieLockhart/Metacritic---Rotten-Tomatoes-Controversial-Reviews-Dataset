Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mr Plinkett summed up the movie nicely. The prequels are terrible but harmless. This film ruins the entire original trilogy and the future trajectory.","true":true}
