Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was more like spaceballs from the beginning. For me a disgrace to the star wars saga. \\nMark Hamil did a real good job. Probs for that.\\nFor the love of star wars i give 1 star. The effects were as expected really good.\\nA big budget does not make a great movie. Maybe this movie is made for kids and not for a audience with a proper demand for seeing a good movie.\\n\\nFor me sadly the worst star wars movie so far.","true":true}
