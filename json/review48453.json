Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without giving spoilers\\, all I can say was that the movie was a let down. There was a lot of hype. But it all kind of fizzled. Half of the movie was pointless as it followed Finn and Rose try to do something that didn't really move the plot along. Luke\\, who is supposed to be a bada** doesn't really get the justice he deserves. Rey is somehow super powerful still\\, even though she had almost no training. The ending felt rushed... I mean\\, it felt like an Avengers movie\\, not Star Wars. Eh.","true":true}
