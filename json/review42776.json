Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was incredibly disappointing to me. While I admit as a stand alone film\\, it is a \\\"decent\\\" movie. We all know that this isn't a stand alone movie though. Once upon a time in a galaxy far far away\\, the jedi actually had to train to use the force\\, couldn't beat Luke Skywalker in a stick duel with 0 training\\, and the bad guys were actually renown for their on screen prowess. Those days are gone. We now have a world where anyone with a broom can use the force and the bad guys are confused\\, emo\\, and generally unappealing. This movie should have taken Rey's character andrefined it under Luke's tutelage. Make her legit under existing Star Wars lore. During this time\\, have Kylo actually develop into a villain. I'm not even going to touch on what was done to Luke... he deserved better than death from over-meditation. All in all\\, a decent movie\\, but a terrible Star Wars movie.","true":true}
