Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very uninteresting. They chickened out from perfect deaths for Leia and Finn. I don't give a crap about any of the characters. Captain Phasma was the only decent villain(quite good actually) but they only gave her like five minutes before having her die again. Where's Peter Cushing when you need him? The jokes were bad and out of place. Although there were some good moments\\, like the initial bombing run and the duel\\, The Last Jedi movie was a huge disappointment and a waste of thirteen dollars.","true":true}
