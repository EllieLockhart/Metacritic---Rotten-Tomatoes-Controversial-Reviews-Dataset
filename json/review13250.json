Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont understand this backlash for the latest installment to this franchise . Perhaps some don't accept the direction this franchise is going ?? I think that the last jedi is the movie the star ward franchise needed  in my opinion. The bold direction director johson took really surpised me in a good way the visual was amazing","true":true}
