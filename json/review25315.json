Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No idea how the fan score is lower than many Terrible movies. I am starting to think that half the reviews on here in the negative  haven't actually seen the movie and are Disney haters or something. It was very well done overall and was probably a better overall movie than the Force awakens albeit a bit more complicated and serious at times. Maybe people just didn't get the complexities? Like when millions complained about a 10 second lack of sound to movie theaters when it clearly was part of the movie. The movie does a great job setting up episode IX as well.","true":true}
