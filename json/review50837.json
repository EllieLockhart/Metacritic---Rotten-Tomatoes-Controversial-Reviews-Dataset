Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bloated\\, poorly written film. Why were the bombers so slow? There's no air-resistance in space. Why didn't any of the other captains who went down with their ships do a lightspeed kamikaze to destroy first order ships? If Rose believed you should save what you love\\, why didn't she fly into the big gun to save her rebel friends instead of needlessly sacrificing her life to leave Finn stranded and potentially injured at the feet of an invading force poised to kill them all anyways. Since when can a jedi ghost make physical contact with anything\\, and if they can\\, why doesn't Yoda just fight? Why is it so hard for the First Order to shoot one ship moving in a straight line\\, as opposed to the several it destroyed in a weaving pattern? How many heavy-handed 'moral of the story' lessons do we need shoved down our throats to make each over-long tangent to a plot mostly ripped off from episodes 5 & 6 seem relevant and meaningful? Rey narrates her vision in the dark cave for the audience. How are there still people unable to see how terrible this writing is? This movie was a sloppy mess. If it wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, it would've bombed hard. It just isn't a good movie. Time will reveal this movie as the mediocre waste of time that it is.","true":true}
