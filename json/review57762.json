Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whilst the start of the movie was very entertaining\\, with good visual effects and fantastic space scenes\\, we were soon confronted to Disney's own version of Star Wars\\, which in my opinion (and for many fans)\\, badly represents the franchise and threw away the 40 years worth of expanded universe material which surrounds it.\\n\\nThe movie was sloppy and far too long. It had a huge amount of potential but this was thrown away for new underdeveloped\\, pointless characters\\, and obvious plot holes.\\n\\nI can honestly say that this movie was disappointing.","true":true}
