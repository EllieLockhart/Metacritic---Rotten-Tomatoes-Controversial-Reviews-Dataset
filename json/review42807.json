Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was not for the fans....s ad because those are the people who invested year's learning and loving each character..above all it was a story of excitement and wonder and obvious wrong and right\\, it's not the walking dead where u have to kill a star character just to make people watch..starwars needs to back to its roots of adventure\\, romance\\,and bad guys who need be vanquished by the hero...just my opinion..may the force be with u \u263a","true":true}
