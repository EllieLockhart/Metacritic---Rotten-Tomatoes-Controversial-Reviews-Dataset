Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Good: \\n-Cinematography \\n-Adam Driver's performance\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n-Film is full of Slapstick humor & Comic Relief. Imagine if Luke's training on Dagobah had been interrupted by Gungans farting and talking about bantha poodoo. This movie does that.  \\n-Terrible CG...like prequel-era bad.\\n-Pointless subplots with poorly written characters that contribute nothing to the overall story\\n-The Casino: what were they thinking? Completely pulled us out of the star wars universe.\\n-CG nipples\\, CG multi-breasted casino goes. Seriously what were they thinking? \\n-Cute CG animals intended purely to sell merchandise. Overused\\, and so painfully obvious. Zero subtlety at any point. \\n-Added very little to the story or the character development","true":true}
