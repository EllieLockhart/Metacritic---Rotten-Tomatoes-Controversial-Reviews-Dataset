Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this chapter\\, there were some scenes\/parts that I could have done without but overall I really liked it.  \\nI wished a few more plot-lines and characters had been fleshed out more while some segments could have been reduced.\\n\\nIt'll be interesting to watch the entire trilogy and see it as a whole","true":true}
