Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It didn't feel like Starwars. It felt more like Battlestar Galactica with the plot and the comments made. The humor felt extremely forced and poorly done for 90% of the movie. Some of the moments that probably weren't meant to be funny were and what was supposed to be\\, fell flat due to the timing\\, content\\, and situations. The dialogue felt like Mass Effect Andromedia writers got a hold of it... (pretty terrible in some cases). The introduced characters were forgettable and inconsequential (to me).\\n\\nThe film is entertaining and was decent. It's beautiful and sounds fantastic. There were some awesome good sections. \\nHowever\\, I'd rank it with the prequels. This movie felt like another Rogue One filler episode with very little real development or plot growth.","true":true}
