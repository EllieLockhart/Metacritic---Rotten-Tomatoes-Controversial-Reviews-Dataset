{"101487":108600,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before the film began\\, the projectionist was having issues getting the IMAX 3D working. First\\, \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" began and was stopped then it took three times until the issue was solved and the film began. This turned out to be foreshadowing the film itself. It starts and stalls and then picks up pace again and stalls. The answers that you are hoping for are either unanswered or a let down. While the first 140 minutes drag through silly subplots (Finn and Rose's adventure) that are essentially pointless\\, the resistance running out of gas (has fuel ever been an issue in the past?)\\, and basically three days of training for Rey\\, it isn't until the last 20 minutes where the film actually gets exciting. I've seen reviews that state it's a departure and something different. Really\\, it's a film trying to do too much and not accomplishing any of the goals. There were even a few \\\"come on!\\\" moments where\\, as an audience member\\, you give up your suspension of disbelief and really feel that a \\\"serious\\\" moment is a joke (flying Leia). Benicio Del Toro's character is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks. The epic battle at the end between Luke and Ben is really the only thing one needs to take away from this film. I am looking forward to Episode IX to see how this trilogy is played out\\, but The Last Jedi\\, to me\\, doesn't due the franchise justice. The majority of the film was boring. I am perplexed at the vast difference of the critic reviews vs. the audience score. I agree with the Variety's review of this being the longest and least essential chapter in the series. It was\\, for lack of a better word\\, \\\"meh.\\\" For all of Disney's efforts to make it a kid friendly film\\, it certainly isn't due to length and lack of action. What I will say\\, is I like where the next film is headed specifically based on the last scene of the film. So\\, call \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" a placeholder with a few bits of valuable information\\, two amazing lightsaber battles\\, and the porgs. That's it.","true":true}
