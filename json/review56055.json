Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So Inconsistent and lazy writing. After seeing this film\\, you would think Rian Johnson has never ever seen a Star Wars film. I don't know where to begin. Force Awakens was brilliantly shot\\, and setup a great direction with a lot of hope and questions to be answered\\, and last Jedi Came along and just crapped all over Force Awakens. \\n\\nThe End of Force Awakens we finally get to see Luke Skywalker who was in exile. Rey finds him and hands him over the iconic historic Father's lightsaber which he hasn's seen since Cloud City when he lost his hand\\, what does he do? Tosses if over his shoulder basically saying go F youself lol.  That's not Luke Skywalker. yeah\\, he lost Ben to the darkside\\, but Ben seems more conflicted than Vader was\\, and Luke was able to bring Vader back into the light...  Luke wouldn't give up.\\n\\nAlso\\, why even bother. Luke doenst need to get in his x-wing\\, he can just be lazy and force project himself and TAA-DAA!  ALL SET!  I jJUST SAVED THE DAY!\\n\\nWe got people flying in space now\\, why not? \\n\\nThe biggest question we all had was who is SNOKE\\, and how did he rise to power and recover the Fallen empire and build them up into the all powerful First Order who has all the funding and tech to build a super death star and track people in lightspeed? doesnt matter\\, it JUST IS...\\n\\nI have faith JJ Abrams will get us out of this mess and bring a little bit of balance back to the force.","true":true}
