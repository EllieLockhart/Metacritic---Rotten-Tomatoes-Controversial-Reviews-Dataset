Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone else notice how every positive review of TLJ is some vague\\, boring-ass variation of \\\"it was bold! It was different!\\\" that manages to avoid any meaningful justification - whereas the legion negative reviews are scathingly precise\\, passionately written and chock-filled with specific examples of why the movie sucked. We all know the truth - TLJ was a confused\\, poorly executed film that was more concerned with potty jokes and lazy \\\"gotcha!\\\" plot beats than actual storytelling. Any critic worth their salt knows this too\\, but they can't say anything for fear of going against the prevailing social justice groupthink of hollywood. Critics are facing a major credibility crisis (as is Rotten Tomatoes). More of them are becoming bought-and-paid-for corporate shills scared to \\\"toe the party line\\\". They prize ideology over art (storytelling) and that's a VERY dangerous place to be. Hope they're prepared to be not taken seriously anymore. \\n\\nLastly\\, I'll say I have ZERO problem with socially progressive themes in sci fi - after all\\, that's always been a hallmark of the genre - however Rian Johnson presents his social justice themes with all the subtlety and nuance of a fifth grader (disposable C-plot with a black and female asian\\, disproportionate number of strong female characters\\, weak or buffoonish male characters needing the guidance of said females). Come on Rian! These feel so obvious and forced that they insult your audience's intellect - and ultimately serve to distract\\, not enhance\\, your story.","true":true}
