Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm honestly not sure why people are reacting so negatively. I loved it\\, as did pretty much everyone in the showing I saw. I lost track of amount of times people applauded and there was a standing ovation at the end\\, which from what I've heard happened at many other viewings. There were enough similarities to the Originals that it still felt like Star Wars\\, but it wasn't a carbon copy which made the movie more exciting and more surprising. They actually told us a new story rather than rehashing an old one and essentially ripping the Original Trilogy off. If you want to watch the originals then watch the originals. If you actually want a new Star Wars this movie is wonderful. It was hilarious but still knew when to get serious\\, the fast pace kept things exciting\\, and the characters developed and changed which made the movie more challenging and intriguing. I'd say it was the best movie of this year\\, at least in my opinion.","true":true}
