Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Though you spot some worrying influences from what i assume is Disney board members\\, at the very heart of this movie\\, there is still what every Star Wars fan has come to love.
