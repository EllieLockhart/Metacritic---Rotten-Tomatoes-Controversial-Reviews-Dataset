Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made this account just to review this movie.\\n\\nI grew up with SW\\, and this absolutely ruined it for me.  \\n\\nThe build up to see Luke\\, but to find instead a cowardly fool that resembled nothing like his original character is heartbreaking.\\n\\nWatching Princess Laei was painful to watch\\, as was her second in command.  They had conspicuous roles that looked more about making a statement about feminism than playing any role or adding to the story line in any meaningful way.\\n\\nSadly I cannot recommend this movie\\, and I am shocked that the critics are giving this any decent review.  The magic is gone\\, replaced by something hard to describe - but it smells pungent and rotten.","true":true}
