Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To keep it succinct\\, this movie felt very much like a mishmash of \\\"ideas\\\" and \\\"messages\\\" and gimmicks along with some genuinely amazing filmography periodically mixed in. The director's vision (or was it just a collection of people's suggestions) for this movie was so incoherent and disjointed that it even manifested in the acting (e.g.\\, Mark Hamill\\, Laura Dern\\, Adam Driver).","true":true}
