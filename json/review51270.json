Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely stunning! Rian Johnson gave us an incredible gift with this installment of the Star Wars saga. Unexpected story\\, non stop excitement\\, many shocking (but right) moments...As a life long fan of star wars\\, this blew me out of the water. I have no idea what to expect for Episode IX\\, and I kind of like it that way. Bravo\\, Mr. Johnson\\, cast\\, and crew. You guys knocked it out of the park!!","true":true}
