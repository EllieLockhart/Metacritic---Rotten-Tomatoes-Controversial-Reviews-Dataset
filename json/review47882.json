Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While a visually stunning film\\, I felt the story lacked the heart that made me care about the characters since I was a small child seeing Episode IV for the first time. Whatever was missing\\, this is the first time I actually don't care what happens next. I loved Force Awakens\\, loved Rogue One - but this one was genuinely forgettable and seeing Luke blunder so badly as a teacher and as a Jedi was truly heartbreaking. Absolutely the end of an era\\, and in no way the beginning of a better one.","true":true}
