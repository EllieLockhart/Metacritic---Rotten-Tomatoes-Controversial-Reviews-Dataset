Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good :\\n-some awesome FX\\n-a few cool scenes\\n-Kylo and Rey are much better than in VII\\n\\nThe ugly :\\n-clear ripoffs from ESB and ROTJ (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all the way)\\n-weak main plot and terrible subplots (which make the movie feel MUCH \\n too long)\\n-poorly exploited side characters with zero backgrounds\\n-the guardian of the galaxy humour-like doesn't work\\, at worst it even \\n alters the perception you have from the characters and make it look like a \\n spacballs ripoff.","true":true}
