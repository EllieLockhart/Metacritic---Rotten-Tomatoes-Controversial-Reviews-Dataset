From the best animations I've seen in this generation to incredible gameplay and story\\, you really get why Naughty Dog is known to be the best in the bizz. Its hard to go into details without spoiling but I say this is really worth it. Do not be discouraged by the review troll bombing. I highly recommend this game for people who love post apocalyptic settings\\, survival crafting\\, and horror elements.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
