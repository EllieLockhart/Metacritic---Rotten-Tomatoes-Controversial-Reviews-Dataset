Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i loved this its my 2nd favorite star wars second only to revenge of the sith\\nthe action was good but the casino scene was boring\\,weird\\,and way to long i would have loved them to cut that out  and give kylo ren and luke a real lightsaber fight if they had cut the casino scene out they would have had time for cooler stuff like made Finn vs captain phasma longer and of course given luke and ren a better fight","true":true}
