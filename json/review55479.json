Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie is well made - a credit to everyone not named Rian Johnson. The storytelling and direction on the other hand is utterly disappointing. \\n\\nThis movie is clearly a bunch of left-wing propaganda to appeal to diversity. \\n\\nAs much as I could write a significant critique about this movie - I rather let it go and accept the end of the franchise for me. I now pretend star wars does not exist and will not be seeing the next instalments.\\n\\nAs far as fake reviews go\\, critics are upset that the general consensus is that the movie is not great. Audience score is clearly more significant than tomato critic score since the audience sample size is more indicative of how the overall population feels. At the time of writing this review\\, who's opinion is worth more - 318 'professional' critics who have failed as writers or 125\\,227 people who have genuine concerns.\\n\\nBut please continue to whine about how audience scores are fake and botted\\, it is really quite amusing.","true":true}
