Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was really good.  Few things I would change and the humor is awfully marvel like.  I think the hangup people have is they are going in with their fan theories of how it should go and it does not go that way.","true":true}
