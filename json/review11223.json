Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly it just wasn't good. Out of the whole movie their were only 4 parts I liked\\, and even those scenes are divisive among fans. The rest of the movie is garbage. But those 4 scenes kinda make up for it which is why I give it the extra half star. If those 4 scenes weren't in there I'd give it a two star.","true":true}
