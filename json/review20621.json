Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I very much enjoyed this film. There is so much attention given to the character development. You see characters change their viewpoints and behavior throughout the film and they even defy your expectations. I felt much more connected with the characters emotionally than in TFA. Also\\, the highs in this film are so uplifting and impactful. Two moments in the film\\, in particular\\, I could not keep myself from tearing up. Not because they were sad\\, but because they were magical. Keep up the great work Disney. It\u2019s unfair a studio this corporate can be this original.","true":true}
