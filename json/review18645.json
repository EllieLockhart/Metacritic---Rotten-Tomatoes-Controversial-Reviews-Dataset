Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I took my grandson to see this yesterday and even he didn't like it. I saw the original one in the 70's and I guess I've always enjoyed all the movies... untill now. This one was long an boring and no hero's to cheer for. It has a bunch of females running things now. where are the men in this?","true":true}
