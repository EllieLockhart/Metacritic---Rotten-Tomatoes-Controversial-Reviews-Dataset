Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has done an admirable job in helping take something old and helped steer it towards the new for a whole new generation of Star Wars fans! Can't wait for more!!!","true":true}
