Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay before everyone says it's amazing it has no flaws and it a great film honestly it does. I will go into detail but the film itself are like the rest family friendly and some very\\, very cute moments with those penguins things (Porgs). \\nI will start off saying the movie started of the from the previous film from force awakens. Where we see the resistance fleeing from their planet before they are blown up by a massive spaceship when suddenly there great pilot blows up there big ship and allow the resistance to fly away in safety. Where we also  see rei with Luke Skywalker asking him to go back to the resistance in order for him to save resistance and help fight against the evil empire that has risen again. \\n\\nEnd of me saying about the whole story until you watch it. okay now that I am done with the fancy short beginnings with the story a lot of questions was really answered? I don't want to really ruin it for people but if you think clearly and think hard after watching the film there are a lot of things un answered in this movie but it does not mean it's a bad film there are many moments you will love this film and love it for being what it is and that is most important some very special moments\\, and some samey moments. All I will say and honest say this ask questions about the things they did not answer but a good movie over all.","true":true}
