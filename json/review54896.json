Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems we are collectively too afraid to admit the truth that the new trilogy is simply bad - but that tends to happen when your childhood is being held hostage at gunpoint.\\nThe movie is entertaining at times with some genuinely funny moments. However\\, the plot goes nowhere\\, plot holes become a hazard 30 minutes into the movie\\, character development is bare-bone\\, characters are either underutilized or a sad attempt at new Boba Fett. Main characters are little more than errand boys\/girls and villains are so poorly done you almost feel sad for them. At no point in the movie do they convince you that they are a threat. Watching Resistance and New Order exchange blows is like watching rowdy neighbourghood kids bicker in the street and trow mud at each other. You don't really care\\, but they make so much noise you either wanna pour water over them or call their parents.","true":true}
