Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was completely surprised by the audience score for this movie. Going into this movie for the most part it delivered what I was hoping for. Although a little weak in some parts the overall movie I thought was pretty good and think it\u2019s a great Star Wars movie that all should see because they actually gave us a different kind of Star Wars movie not just another rehash. Overall I really liked the movie and would actually give it a 4.4 out of 5.","true":true}
