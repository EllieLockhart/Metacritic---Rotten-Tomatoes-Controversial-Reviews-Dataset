Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We were ready at the trough to eat almost anything Star Wars\\, and the director and writers fed us this indigestible stew. The story and plot seemed the be written by a 7 year old kid that mixed every good and bad ideas into the story whether it made sense or not. I can\u2019t believed I almost stood in line at midnight just to see this junk. Star Wars cartoons has better character development and plots. ","true":true}
