Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from an odd choice of visuals with Leia in space\\, bombs that somehow fell in space\\, and the fact that one character waited 10 minutes later than she should have top enact a solution to the problems of the resistance\\, I thought it was a great film!  Luke has character for the first time since lamenting being kept from buying power converters in the first movie\\, Po has an actual story arc\\, the relationship between Rei and the other force users is great\\, cameos are well executed\\, and the hacker is a more realistic criminal than Han ever was.  His motivations are well defined (If shallow)\\, and you understand his (most everybody's really) motivations for everything that gets done.  So\\, yeah... I thought it was great!","true":true}
