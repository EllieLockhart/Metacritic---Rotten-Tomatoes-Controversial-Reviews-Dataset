Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 54% and falling audience score is justified.  Don't see this movie.  Disney royally s**t the bed with Last Jedi.  Plot holes\\, no sense logic\\, insulting to previous Star Wars lore built up so far\\, and Star Wars Episode 7 may as well not have happened.  Anti-male\\, strong social justice warrior feminism throughout the movie.  Last Star Wars movie I will be seeing by Disney.  Thanks for ruining Star Wars!","true":true}
