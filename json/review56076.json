Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many weird choices stopped this from being a great movie. I thought the Luke disillusionment\\, the grey force and whatnot all could've been interesting\\, but nothing is developed properly or committed to. As we see after episode 9\\, the lack of lasting conflict here made the trilogy. It would've been new and interesting had Ray joined Kylo\\, or if Finn actually did sacrifice himself to save his new friends\\, but all drama is hinted at then backed away from. Also the humour felt very cringe and marvel and I held expected Finn or Poe to look at the camera with a goofie smile after a zinger.","true":true}
