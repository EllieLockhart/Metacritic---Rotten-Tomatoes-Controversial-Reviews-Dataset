Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in a big fan of Rian Johnson's previous work and hoping he could walk the tightrope of making a smart but still entertaining Star Wars movie. Instead\\, what we have here is a movie that fails at its attempts at humor and insight\\, fails to keep a respectable run time\\, fails to make us care about a single one of the many plastic characters\\, and fails to properly use the most bankable movie prop in history (the lightsaber). All I? wanted was a Luke Skywalker Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon moment and all I? got was a moping train wreck of a character arch. Finn and Rose is unwatchable\\, which sucks because your stuck watching them for what feels like the whole movie . The critics are in on the Disney takeover and are definitely being paid. Don't make the mistake I? made by paying Disney to disrespect your time.","true":true}
