Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are good parts to this movie.  This is by no means as good or even close to The Empire Strikes Back\\, don't let anyone tell you that.  I'm tired of the corny dialog... admiral whateverhername was said \\\"Godspeed\\\" really? thats the best you could write?  Who the f is writing these screenplays????... and there were a couple of things in this movie that are just ridiculous... even for a fantasy movie.  I thought Luke's treatment in this screenplay was pretty good.  Kylo and Rey dynamic was good.  It was better than The Force Awakens\\, at least it took some risks.","true":true}
