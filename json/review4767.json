Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ridiculous. It was embarrasing all the time. It felt like a blend of Harry Potter and The Flintstones. Why so much pushing the social integration? This is a movie with a huge background and not a current political position. Gleeson (Hux) continues to be the worst actor of this story.","true":true}
