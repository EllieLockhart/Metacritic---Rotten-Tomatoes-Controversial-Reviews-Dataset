Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just unbelievably bad. I get the business decision here to \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" so Disney can keep making films for decades to come without relying on the original cast. That said\\, it was a little too obvious\/blunt\/garish (and lazy) to have a character come straight out with that statement and rub it in the faces of fans of the original movies\\, but I digress. Disney could have honored what people loved about the hope and glass-half-full characteristics of Luke vs. throwing him away as a cranky loser. Taking it one step further - it's as though Disney goes out of its way to disavow that Luke is the entire linchpin in Star Wars - they want you to believe he is \\\"just another character\\\" so you can stop investing in him to move on to Rey and team\\, If the story had shown that Luke was invested in Rey and the cause (even if he would have died)\\, then fans would have been invested in Rey and the cause. They wasted the opportunity to use Luke to pass the torch and instead created such a polar divisiveness\\, that it may be unrecoverable - which for Disney means they may leave several millions on the table for future movies\\, but that won't matter when you are talking billions. Again\\, they didn't have to take this blunt force method of propelling the new characters forward by making the original main character look weak. So I apologize for not being able to give credit to prior reviewers for this analogy\\, but its so good I'm going to paraphrase...who in their right mind would be stupid enough to greenlight a script and make a movie where they pull the Harry Potter character off the shelf after 30 years and make him a complete loser\\, won't fight evil\\, won;t come out of hiding to save his friends....oh\\, and no longer does magic\\,  I'll tell you who greenlights a movie like that - Kathleen Kennedy...(never written a movie reviw in my life\\, but created an account just to get this off my chest after all these months - just a really bad movie\\, bad storytelling and bad decisions)","true":true}
