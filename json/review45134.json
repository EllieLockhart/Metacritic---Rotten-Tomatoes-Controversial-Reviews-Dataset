Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately it was what I had  thought. The movie was fairly flashy and action packed but the story wasn't very strong. Overall it was episodic\\, contained far too much exposition and was entirely cliche. Hopefully Disney doesn't make these mistakes again. Nevertheless I would recommend watching it at least once\\, but probably not more than once.","true":true}
