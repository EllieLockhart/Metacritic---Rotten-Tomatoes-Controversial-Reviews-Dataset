{"101487":106383,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total disappointment! Rian Johnson should have been fired...there were tons of schizophrenic plot lines but no arc to the story. The Last Jedi left me angry. 45 minutes of my life was wasted with a Casino scene that made absolutely no sense. This episode was supposed to be about Skywalker\\, but it was so badly written and badly directed...it turns out to be about nothing. Oh\\, and then whoops Skywalker is dead. For fans of this franchise it is an insult. This movie should NEVER have made it to the cinema\\, a poorly conceived\\, horribly crafted pile of poo.","true":true}
