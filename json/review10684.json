Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some great moments\\, but had way too many cringe moments and terrible forced humor. Very disappointed in the treatment of the characters\\, especially Luke. They fundamentally changed his character in every way. A lot of really glaring plot holes and pretty much every action was taken to force the story along and didn't make sense. Without getting into spoilers\\, nothing the characters did made rational sense. I'll give it credit for exciting action scenes and beautiful cinematography\\, but that is it.","true":true}
