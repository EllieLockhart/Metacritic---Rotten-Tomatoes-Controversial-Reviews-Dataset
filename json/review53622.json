Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First I will start with why I gave it three stars. The good stuff\\, Luke's return from darkness. He redeems him self and shows how powerful he had become. He sees his setting suns\\, he talks to Master yoda and yoda once again teaches him a lesson. Chewbacca is always a Star. So him making his grand entrance to Luke's earned one star all on its own. And of course the power of the women. \\nHere is what was horrible. And it was a lot of the movie. The side story of Finn and Rose. And don't get me wrong\\, I like Finn\\, I just didn't like the direction he was taken In this movie. And Del Toro's character was pointless and silly. The stuttering thing he did was contrived and embarrassing. The Guardians of the Galaxy style space walk. Uhm. Space Mary Poppins anyone??? It was dumb. The whole movie was haptic. It was disjointed and uncomfortable. There was little cohesion in it at all. I am only hoping that episode ix can redeem it. Help me JJ Abrams\\, you are my only hope.","true":true}
