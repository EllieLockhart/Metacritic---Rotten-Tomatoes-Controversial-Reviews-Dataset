Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Director should have never been given free license to ruin everything that made Star Wars the best saga ever created. To create all the new force powers like a flying through space Leia\\, Yoda ghost powers\\, weird communication between Rey and Kylo\\, Skywalker hologram etc etc\\, was a real show of narcissism with sociopathic tendencies. To think that he could pull it off is laughable and insulting to any true fan\\, you ain't that good pal. The script was well off key\\, Snoke coming across as a pantomime villain not even worthy of a Punch and Judy show on Blackpool Pier\\, and as for the dire\\, immature\\,completely out of place humour\\,even the Rugrats has you beat on that one pal. And to insult Skywalker like you did shows with what enormity you totally misunderstood the whole point of the saga. More disappointed than you could possibly imagine. Let's hope JJ can restore a glimmer of what the saga so desperately needs and deserves\\, but it will take a miracle unfortunately\\, as where JJ opened doors for the sequel\\, the selfish\\, narcissistic\\, ignorant tool\\, closed so many firmly behind him. Good luck JJ\\, and may the force be with you. ( You could always pretend it was a dream)!!!!!","true":true}
