Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The acting was good.  I don't blame the actors.  The music was good\\, too.  Everything else I saw in this film made me hate Star Wars.  It's hard for me to put into words how much i hated this film  It wasn't just a bad Star Wars film\\, it was one of the worst films I have ever seen.","true":true}
