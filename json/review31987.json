{"101487":169390,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers Ahead:\\n\\nThis was an absolutely trash film of unbelievable proportions that deserves nothing less but to be dropped in the biggest dump in history full of faecal matter; the story absolutely stinks and the characters stink of horseshit. The story is rife with more plot holes than I've seen in a LOOONG time\\, and the amount of plot armour\\, plot convivences\\, Dues ex Machina's and MacGuffins are completely ridiculous. Pretty much every worthwhile character is completely wasted\\, and fan favourites like Admiral Ackbar (the creator of TFA and TLJs own Resistance at that) are killed off-screen whilst shitty characters like Vice Admiral Purple hair gets a special death.  This movie spits on literally all 3 decades of SW history\\, its characters and lore. It spits on its morals\\, honour and integrity. It deconstructs everything beautiful about the world\\, taking a field trip on our beloved mythos whilst playing wack-a-mole like a child. Rey suddenly learnt how to swim despite being born on a desert planet; Finn suddenly knows how to fly; Poe downloaded plot armour and honestly every character just \\\"Suddenly\\\" can do whatever the heck they feel like with no training or repercussions of any kind. Every little side plotline from TFA was completely dropped and thrown away much like how Luke threw the lightsaber in the early portion of the film -it's like TFA never happened.\\nStarkiller base being destroyed was meant to be one of the biggest blows to the Empire - sorry\\, the First ORDER in the recent war - not only that\\, the Resistance was largely unharmed in the last film\\, with their fleet intact - only the Republic suffered a major lose. However\\, here's the killer\\, TLJ treats the Resistance and the New Republic like they're the exact same entity\\, in fact one character just about uses them interchangeably!  Now apparently the Resistance is basically destroyed with little to no fleet. This movie invalidates TFA let alone the other films. It's like it never happened in many ways (Finn was meant to only have been a janitor on the Starkiller base\\, yet TLJ says he worked on the new bigass destroyer too)\\, and the First Order is running around with somehow innumerable resources despite wasting so much on the SK base in the previous film and is so literally massive it's unbelievable considering this is meant to be the more centralised half of the New Republic (which the film still hasn't explained\\, I only know this because I read the books! It is entirely sad that these last two films have been allowed to go by with virtually NO worldbuilding or explanations for ANYTHING happening in this verse to the point where their own big bads\\, the Space Nazi's are completely unknown onscreen).\\nLast Jedi feels like when the MTV Movie Awards used to parody scenes from popular movies. General Hux getting a crank call on the bridge (Wtf?)\\, Luke throwing away the light saber like trash\\, then going to milk a sea creature's nipple\\, Leia flying through space like fucking Marry Poppins. This isn't supposed to be a throwaway Marvel movie with lots of cheap laughs. Doing so undermines the evil of the villains and makes light of the seriousness of the themes of the movie. The characterizations of Luke and Leia runs false. After watching 5  planets blown up\\, finding out the First Order corrupted her son to kill his father and watching her friends\\, including Ackbar blown into space\\, the Leia of the original trilogy would be fucking going in and ramming Snoke's ship herself not sending a subordinate to do it (again with that ramming\\, how the hell does anyone think that makes sense?). Luke would never attempt to kill his sister's son while he was sleeping\\, run away to an island to die alone\\, ignore his sister's call to join the fight\\, and then refuse to show up in person to protect her like a damn coward. Whomever wrote this movie didn't understand the characters and didn't care about disgracing them in their last scenes. As mentioned before\\, the movie lacks any continuity from the Force Awakens even though they take place moments apart. Why was a map left to find Luke\\, why is the Resistance completely wiped out\\, why didn't Hux return to Snoke\\, how is Finn and his jacket okay when he just had his spine sliced by Kylo Ren? Plot ideas and interesting characters that Force Awakens created are abandoned with total disinterest (Snoke\\, Knights of Ren\\, Phasma). The 3 new hero characters are robbed of major hero moments and are isolated the whole movie. The movie wastes our time with 2 secondary plots that accomplish nothing other than a very cool explosion and a long escapade to a Casino planet. Finn and Rey's competence in combat against much more experienced fighters remains an ongoing mystery that might just be a result of awful storytelling.\\nSome points:\\n1. Luke actually says \\\"laser swords\\\" instead of lightsaber! WTF\\n2. Leia can fly in deep space despite never being trained in the force and running away from the force for most of her life as revealed in Disney canon. How the fuck do they think the force works that way? WTF\\n3. Gravity in space apparently exists\\, bombers can retardedly drop bombs now in a vacuum.\\n4. 9 movies until someone decided to weaponize hyperspace... The Vice Admiral Purple Hair is the only one to apparently to use this tactic\\, which makes no sense in the least. Honestly it destroys every space battle to date as they have fucking hypersace nukes! This invalidates the whole mythos! Idiots. These writers are fucking plebeian and don't know\\, or at least don't bother to read up on how SW lore works with hyperspace in the first place.\\n5. Calling Hyperspace lightspeed - it has NEVER been called that and honestly it is retarded. Think for a moment\\, if hyperspace is simply the speed of light\\, how the fuck do they travel the galaxy so fucking fast? They shouldn't be able to move past several planets as that should take decades!\\n6. Luke dying. Need I say more? His death was fucking pathetic\\n7. Rose\\, who I honestly keep forgetting because she is so useless to the story at large.\\n8. Finn's whole fucking plotline is unimportant and can be cut without harming the film. In fact\\, it'd improve a lot without it.\\n9. Luke drinks space milk from a space cow. Oh\\, and everything about his fucking character in this film is garbage. Fuck you Rian.\\n10. Running out of fuel when most ships are powered by hypermatter or ion drives...which can be recharged\\, and I do believe the Resistance ships nearby look just like the ones that can \\\"refuel\\\". Also\\, plot device. \\n11. Force Ghost Yoda can strike things with lightening from the sky which makes no fucking sense. If Force Ghosts could do that they would come down and take out the enemies for the cast\\, rather than being saddened that they can only give advice (Qui-Gon).\\n12. The huge ships in space travel slower than smaller ships because they are heavier in space...gravity....honestly who the fuck wrote this script? How the fuck are they slower yet stay at the exact SAME distance the whole time? Physics obviously doesn't exist anymore.\\n13. Why did they not just jump to hyperspace in front of the Rebels - sorry Resistance - like the Empire did in the OT?\\n14. Everything with Vice Admiral Purple Hair.\\n15. Finn apparently knew about the lightspeed tracker but didn't think to mention it to the Rebels.\\n16. The whole Knights of Ren plotline from TFA was dropped. The new movie makes no mention to them at all and we still have no clue who they are!\\n17. Luke made a big thing of asking how the heck Rey found him in TLJ when he literally left a whole map behind in TFA to be found in case he needed to be called again to help. \\\"How did you find me?\\\" \\\"You think that I came to the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all?\\\" \\\"I came to this island to die.\\\" Yeah than why did you leave a MAP! I actually facepalmed with this one  WTF\\n18. Luke wants to die now yet he also feeds himself\\, sleeps\\, drinks and lives WTF. \\n19. Plot armour. Apparently\\, hyperspace can rip through whole ships yet the cast on board doesn't get eviscerate which is stupid. When the rebels used the hyperspace tactic to split Snoke's ship in half\\, everyone\\, every single one of the hundreds of stormtroopers on that hanger died immediately\\, however Fin\\, Phasma and Rose all survive (wouldn't the vaccum of space seep in as no hull or shields are protecting the vessel?) without problems. Oh\\, and when the first order starts firing at the dropships heading towards that rebel base. Why does Leia's ship not get hit? And the bomber scene. The first 3 ships were taken out almost immediately by the first order by concentrating all of their firepower on them. Then as the battle goes on\\, they decide to take way longer to destroy the last two\\, where the last one becomes seemingly invincible to the firepower of hundreds of fighters and cannons from the surrounding star destroyers... I feel like this movie was directed more towards kids without brain cells. \\n20. Phasma got lol'd again!\\n21. Somehow everyone has forgotten in the film Darth Vader was able to track Princess Leia's ship in A New Hope after it jumped to hyperspace. Even in Rogue One Jyn stumbles on Empire files detailing \\\"hyperspace tracking navigational systems.\\\" However\\, this makes it strange when everyone acts like this is something out of the blue or why it took decades and a single maintenance worker named Rose to figure out what was going on. Continuity is fucked.\\n22+23. The movie is not original either. The entire Rey story is stolen from ESB. She travels alone to a distant plant to meet a strange reclusive Jedi Master for training\\, while there she discovers an ominous cave that will hint the truth about who she is before disobeying the Jedi Master and confronting an enemy that reveals who her parents are (Dagobah = Ach-To). That is the main plot of ESB beat for beat. Meanwhile the rebels bunkered-in fight AT-AT's on a salt\/snow planet that they must retreat for their lives (Crait=Hoth). While visiting a corrupt wealthy planet the good guys meet a shady character they ask for help but he betrays them (Canto Bight=Cloud City). Do not tell me Last Jedi is any more original than Force Awakens.\\n\\nOne of the real issues of this film is that it no longer cares about real heroes fighting for freedom. The Star Wars that came out forty years ago was a movie bursting with vision and genius from a man who drank deeply from mythology and timeless heroic epics. The guy who wrote \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" has obviously never read from Joseph Campbell or Mircea Eliade\\, and knows nothing about storytelling except the spineless\\, postmodernist drivel that is foisted on our society where true heroic attributes are \\\"adversarial\\\" and the only good people are perpetual victims. \\nThis film desperately tries to subvert the usual Star Wars formula in many ways\\, which is a gutsy move. However\\, subversion is not automatically good.  In this case\\, what we got in exchange felt rushed\\, lifeless\\, and disappointing. The film drags on for hours yet each scene is rushed and we are never given a chance to breathe before we're shot off to the next splintered plot thread. Characters\/scenes that deserved big shares of the screentime were wrapped up in minutes with intensely unsatisfying conclusions and the plot went literally nowhere. Even the confrontation with Snoke was over incredibly fast. We still know nothing about him\\, so how can I be expected to feel anything when he dies? Kylo Ren had no new development\\, and his inner \\\"conflict\\\" was explained to us\\, and not really shown or felt. Therefore\\, his betrayal of Snoke felt hollow and had no punch to it. Also\\, that duel afterwards was so terrible I shook my head when I saw it. \\nThey turned Luke Skywalker into a quitter who gets drunk on green milk. We're talking about a Jedi Knight who saw a sliver of good in Darth Vader and went against reason in trying to redeem him. To have Luke then pull a lightsaber on his sleeping nephew based on a fleeting vision that he would become evil is beyond absurd. I missed that part of the Jedi code about killing people in their sleep\\, and Luke's nephew no less. Did the writers of this movie not understand the character of Luke Skywalker? \\n\\nThere are so many other problems with this movie that I could spend hours writing some 20-page essays to explore them all. As a hardcore Star Wars fan\\, I cannot accept this movie and will not be seeing them ever again at the cinema. This was a steaming pile of crap\\, the only rating this film deserves can only be a 0.5 out of 10 just for the visuals.","true":true}
