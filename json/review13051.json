Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know exactly what I was expecting when I went to see The Last Jedi\\, but it certainly wasn't what we got. Rian Johnson delivered such a pleasant surprise with this movie that I'm already planning to see it twice more. It's such a shame so many people have decided to review bomb it because the creative team behind it deserves so much more credit for their efforts.","true":true}
