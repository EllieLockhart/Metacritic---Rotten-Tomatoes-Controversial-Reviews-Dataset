Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should be tossed aside and redone...its almost as if the decision makers in this films Egos are so large that they actually thought fans would receive this false portayal of Lukes character in which he's abandoned most if not all of what made Luke..Luke in the OT. It wasn't even believable...it didn't make sense to me and it was a complete slap in the face not only to fans but to Luke Skywalker and Mark Hamill. Aside from that from a story telling standpoint it was painful to watch characters I don't really care about go on a side mission that in the end didn't effect the final outcome. Very sad I am.","true":true}
