Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never written a review until now. I'll try and keep it short. Terrible script\\, awkward interactions between characters\\, plot line has more gaps than a badly dubbed kung-fu movie\\, bad special affects\\, awkward musical score placement\\, underwhelming action scenes\\, stock-photo type character development\\, visually underwhelming\\, and they somehow made Luke Skywalker\\, LUKE SKYWALKER\\, look like a whinning weaping bitch. A fourth grader could direct a better movie and it cost $600\\,000\\,000+. Theres no hope\\, the dark side won. Sorry Mark Hamilton\\, I see now why you were pissed.","true":true}
