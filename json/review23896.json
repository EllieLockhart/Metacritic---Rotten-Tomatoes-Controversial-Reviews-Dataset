Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Makes absolutely no sense that the 9\/10 critics would rate this as a quality cinematic experience. \\n\\nThis movie is straight doo-doo butter. PLEASE\\, take it from someone who is totally neutral. Not a big Star-Wars nerd\\, but definitely not a Star Wars hater. I've thoroughly enjoyed a few of the movies in the past.\\n\\nThey throw a bunch of useless characters in (I assume for diversity's sake)\\, and they expect us to actually care about the plight of these individuals. There is SO much going on\\, so much jibber-jabber\\, but at the end of the day\\, nothing is really happening. As you may have heard\\, Luke is almost like an entirely new character. I guess hes been jaded by his island isolation\\, but come on.... this is so stupid... he shares literally zero character traits with the Luke we knew from the original trilogy. \\n\\nNew Jedi Girl= Doo-doo butter\\n\\nHer little friend from the first movie\\, Finn= Doo-Doo Butter\\n\\nOld-Guy Luke= Doo-Doo Butter\\n\\nGhost Yoda= Doo-Doo Butter\\n\\nOh yeah\\, and one more thing. I know this is fantasy\\, and that we need to be using our imaginations\\, but when Leia started floating through space all frozen and what not... LOL. That was insanity. That was just the corniest thing I've ever seen in my life. \\n\\nAnyways\\, save your self some money and a lot of time. Don't go.","true":true}
