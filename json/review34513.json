Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back. this movie makes a bold move by turning the direction of the movie into an unexpected way\\, the characters developments are amazing and i really cannot wait how the story will resolve in episode IX.","true":true}
