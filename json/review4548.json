Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematography is competent. Other than that\\, plot (very limited\\, boring)\\, script (lines)\\, characters  and character development are horrible. Humor is not funny. Lifelong Star Wars fan\\, severely disgusted by the \\\"product\\\" Disney made. FYI\\, my girlfriend and my college age daughter also disliked the movie just as much as me. I guess we all hate women. Strange\\, because the Battlestar Galactica remake is one of my most beloved television shows ever.","true":true}
