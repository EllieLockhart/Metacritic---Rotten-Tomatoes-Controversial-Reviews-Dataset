Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will make devoted Star Wars fans embrace the prequels like they were on par with the Empire Strikes Back.  \\n\\nThere are so many plot holes and violations of the suspension of disbelief that it is impossible to even casually enjoy this movie.  There is no payoff to any aspect of the story at all.  That is why it is so remarkably \\\"unpredictable\\,\\\" because you went in expecting something to happen to advance the story or something interesting or revealing to happen to any one of the main characters and it never does.  After watching you may ask yourself why does this movie even exist.  A cheap\\, predictable\\, feel-good story would have been preferable to this two and half hour waste.\\n\\nNot only does nothing interesting happen to any of the characters\\, but there is no real character development\\, none that any real person could ever identify with.  At times it feels like a parody of itself.  Like it is making fun of itself and making fun of anyone who liked any of the other Star Wars movies and were foolish enough to think that this movie would go anywhere with the story.\\n\\nThe franchise is dead.  Rian Johnson killed it.  And it really feels like he did it on purpose\\, because it would be difficult to do it as efficiently as the Last Jedi did.","true":true}
