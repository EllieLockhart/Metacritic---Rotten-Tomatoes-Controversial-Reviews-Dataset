Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Need to rename the movie \\\"Social Justice Wars : The Lost Jedi\\\"\\n\\nThe main theme of this movie \\\"men are bad\\, white men are worse\\, women are good and the best at everything\\\"  Oh yeah and all rich people are greedy despicable slavers\\, animal abusers and war profiteers.  Not even worth the half star I gave it.","true":true}
