Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, so I had to create an account just to rate this movie. I don't understand all of the hate. When did we become such cynical assholes. We are so worried about plot holes and non-cannon details that we are unable to be entertained. I loved this movie. It was entertaining and fun. Yes there were unanswered questions and threads that were unfilled\\, but it was great. I dare you to pass the original trilogy through the same shitty filter to which you d9 this film. I suspect that the only real reason this is getting negative reviews is because some fanboys who think they know what understand the Star Wars universe is about has never so much as picked up a book. \\n\\nDO NOT LET THE AUDIENCE REVIEWES FOOL YOU. THIS MOVIE IS WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!","true":true}
