Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Eu achei Os \u00faltimos Jedi MUITO bom. Foi muito bem produzido e dirigido\\, \u00e9 um filme divertido\\, cheio de a\u00e7\u00e3o\\,  emo\u00e7\u00f5es e surpresas e entrega a oportunidade de expandir o universo de Star Wars. Ele tem alguns problemas sim mas\\, na minha opini\u00e3o\\, a quantidade de momentos \u00e9picos se sobressaem e empolgam.","true":false}
