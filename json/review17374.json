Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it 1 time on opening night and that will be the only time I ever watch this dumpster fire of a movie. If this movie had been made in a middle school visual communications class it would have received a C+ at best. It is convoluted mess of a plot with no resemblance of a coherent stream of story telling. It completely ignores EVERYTHING that has made this franchise relavant in pop culture\\, magical and more to the point profitable for decades. The use of awkward\\, forced\\, SLAPSTICK comedy felt like it was wedged into the film and didn't fit. If they had chosen to market the film as Spaceballs 2\\, the last Jedi it would have been a far more accurate description. In a cinimatic world where Disney has set the gold standard for intelligent\\, storytelling combined with heart with it's cohesive Marvel universe. It is baffling to me that such a film as the last Jedi\\, which is so disconnected from it's own cannon and fandom was ever allowed to be made. It effectively torpedoes one of the entertainment industries most proven franchises. Unless isolating their core fan base and severing any interest in this picture or any future films was their goal.....they missed the mark. #sobadimnowpullingforthedarkside","true":true}
