Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tonight I wrote this to disney: Thank you that you destroyed the heros of my childhood with this awful star wars movie. The wonderful spirit of star wars was thrown away\\, the magic of star wars was sacrificed for an absolute ridiculous\\, unworthy\\, bizarre\\, grotesque\\, embarassing and stupid plot. That was no courage to steer star wars into a new direction\\, it was an act that showed an absolute lack of respect for true star wars fans. You will fail!","true":true}
