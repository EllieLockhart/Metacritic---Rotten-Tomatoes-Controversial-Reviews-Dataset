Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent characterization and world building.  Moves the Star Wars Universe forward in interesting and new directions without sacrificing the spirit of the originals.  There are some slight pacing issues but they are in serve of character development so entirely forgivable in my eyes.  Throughly enjoyed it and am disappointed we won't be getting another from Rian Johnson","true":true}
