Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just not good. It's not terrible\\, not the worse movie ever but it is in no way good {or great as critics say.) Even as a stand alone sci-fi movie\\, it's mediocre at best. Goofy characters\\, lame jokes that don't land\\, and a story that doesn't not make you feel any emotion towards any characters. I'm not a Star wars purest but more a sci-fi fan and this movie does nothing to help the genre. ","true":true}
