Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing that is Star Wars that Disney will keep alive is the name\\, everything else that is Star Wars is systematically being put to rest. I waited over 30 years to see a deflated\\, defeated Luke Skywalker and nothing to show for passing on what you have learned? Ben Solo took out the entire new Jedi order\\, while Rey with about 45 minutes of force intro defeats Kylo Ren (TFA which is only slightly better than TLJ)? Not to mention\\, the best war strategy is to Not let anyone else know the plan\\, thus rebels go off on their own sabotaging each other's efforts? Please!!!\\n\\nAfter the movie it felt like Star Wars no longer held its special place in the fabric of society; instead Star Wars as a whole was reduced to just another flick. Why you ask? Becasue now when I watch IV\\, V\\, VI\\, I can only think of Luke becoming this defeated\\, deflated\\, run-and-hide\\, let me kill a padawan instead of trying to turn him to the good side. All this is contrary to Luke's character.","true":true}
