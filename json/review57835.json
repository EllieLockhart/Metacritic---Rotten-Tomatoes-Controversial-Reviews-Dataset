Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched it last night and it is horrible story telling\\, visually great as always\\, but plot holes and uncharacteristic choices everywhere. 3\/10 for real\\, a certain character wakes up early in the movie\\, so hopefully this was all a dream and not canon to where the story goes.","true":true}
