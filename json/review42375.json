Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a betrayal. the more I think on this movie\\, the more it makes me angry. The prequels at least were badly written and had bad acting. The decisions made in this movie were not only a waste but they were disrespectful to the beauty of the Star Wars franchise. I sure hope JJ can safe the mess Rian Johnson has created. ","true":true}
