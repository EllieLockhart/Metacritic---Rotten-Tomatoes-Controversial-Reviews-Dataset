Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They've really lost the plot with all this. I wish they would make up their minds and either make a movie about new characters in the SW universe or just tell the preexisting characters' stories. The creators are caught in the middle and we are left with ill-defined characters being used to tell the stories of other characters by proxy. And as a result\\, even the established returning players seem like they are losing their characterization..","true":true}
