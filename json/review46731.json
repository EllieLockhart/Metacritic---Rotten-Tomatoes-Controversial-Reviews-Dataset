Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weird. every page of these ratings seem to have just the right amount of 3-5 star reviews by people who have only rated this\\, or a group of star wars movies. Almost like the audience meter is being artificially propped up. Well here's my half a star for this trash can fire of a movie. Wont make a dent but i Hope the score goes to 1%.","true":true}
