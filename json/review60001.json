It destroys all of my sympathy and empathy for the characters and that for each of them. It destroys everything.\r\rNow there is only emptiness.\r\r@ NaughtyDog: You did'nt trigger anything in my but frustration. The so called story is nothing but an moralizing pathetic drama\\, a permanently forefinger raised. Believe me\\, you ruined not only TLOU\\, you ruined much for the game industries.\r\rBeside of this there are a lot incomprehensible logical gaps in the game\/story that make the experience even worse.\r\rThe role of the \\\"islanders\\\" obese completely open\\, all said in the game are empty phrases.\r\rsingle scores:\rstory (or whatever that was): 2\rgraphics: 8\rmusic: 8\rgameplay: 5 (heavy input lag even on the Pro\\, sometimes unhappy resource placement\\, ineffective crafting system).
