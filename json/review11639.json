Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly disappointing movie. The characters felt forced\\, the casting was HORRIBLE\\, the jokes were bad\\, the plot uninspired... overall just bad. I literally turned to my wife half way through and said \\\"This is a horrible movie.\\\" The last half hour was ok\\, but didn't;t make up for the suckiness of the first 1.5 hours.","true":true}
