Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They ruined what people loved about Luke in Skywalker Iand had pointless sections that affected the movie in no way whatsoever. They took everything us fans were questioning after The Force Awakens and threw it away with no answer to a rushed over conversation explaining it. I expected better from Disney.","true":true}
