Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked away disappointed and wondering why the script for this movie was ever approved. TLJ is a long movie\\, not because it is filling in lore or explaining characters introduced in the last movie or even in this movie\\, it's long because of fluff. There are a lot of irrelevant scenes and side stories that could have been cut completely without affecting the overall plot. RIP Carrie Fisher\\, you deserved a better movie as your send off.","true":true}
