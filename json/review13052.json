Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how anybody could say this is a great film...I almost walked out after THAT Leia scene...talk about jumping the shark!!! There was so many middle fingers given to the audience and plot holes and bad acting  with no direction. Even the lightsaber fights were bland\\, ridiculous and not entertaining...why didn't anybody use a force power? Jump around\\, push\\, SOMETHING!\\n\\nAnd Snoke...don't get me started on Snoke. \\n\\nThis was not only the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen\\, but the worst movie I've ever seen in general. \\n\\n...the Mouse killed Star Wars.","true":true}
