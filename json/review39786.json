Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an excellent addition to the saga - the batons of command and hero are finally passed on to the new generation. And the final conflict is ready for the next film.\\n\\nThe film managed to intertwine several subplots in a short time period in a solid bit of storytelling and even though the film was long\\, it did not feel long.\\n\\nDefinitely a worthy addition to the saga","true":true}
