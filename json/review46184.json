Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out of the cinema asking \\\"what the f did i just watch?\\\"\\nNot just awful\\, was seemingly created simply to troll long term fans of the star wars universe.\\nWhat was it? \\nTried to watch again on dvd and had to turn it off. \\nThe film that killed star wars. \\nCome back jar jar binks\\, all is forgiven.","true":true}
