Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since I can remember. My first memories were literally watching Empire Strikes Back on VHS.I am extremely disappointed with this film simply because Rian Johnson takes a deconstructionist approach to the SW universe. I don't want a nihilist worldview to be applied to my beloved characters and that's what Disney has done (re: Han Solo and Luke Skywalker). This is the worst SW film to date and will be reviled by fans for all cinematic history. The plot doesn't make sense and drags on for the majority of the film. I've never sat in a SW film and looked at my watch to see how long I've been there until this film. Cinematography is great\\, however\\, but it cannot redeem bad writing. I was really rooting for Finn to be developed as he was my favorite character from The Force Awakens but the writing for him falls flat. It's not the fault of the actor\\, just the writing and direction. The SW universe is clearly lacking any vision or direction. I really hope the leadership at Lucas Films makes some drastic\\, positive changes","true":true}
