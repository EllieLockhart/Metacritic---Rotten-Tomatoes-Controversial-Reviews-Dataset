Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a BAD movie because of so many errors in pacing\\, cause-effect in the plot\\, and out-of-character construction. The movie doesn't take the bold steps we all wanted: New designs (No\\, it's a re-hash of the old ones\\, and done wrong) new planets\\, new situations for the same characters\\, no no and no. The movie goes at lengths to disrespect every character\\, even the ones THEY created! It's an endless parade of mockery of what the franchise stands for\\, an awful disgrace. Sure it has action scenes\\, and humour; but Star Wars was always deeper than space battles and jokes at every turn\\, it taught there is a difference between right and wrong\\, and good and evil; and that evil must be fought\\, here we have a mess of things and political views that are unwanted","true":true}
