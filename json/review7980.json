Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely puzzled at the overwhelmingly positive reviews. We're they all paid off? This movie was so empty of soul and emotion it made me sick. It not only ignored all of the cliffhangers from Force Awakens\\, this movie ignored the Star Wars universe itself. Its so disappointing to see all of history and characters abused and used this way\\, not just with Luke\\, but with Akbar as well. All the things that made Star Wars special are now just cheap props for a cheaper and silly storyline. The only thing expensive here was that ticket.","true":true}
