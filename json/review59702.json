And when you get there the game won't even let you decide if you can or not you're just stuck watching a cutscene that totally negates the entire 15 hours you just went throught. It's bad \\, really bad. The story is a joke \\, the characters are 100% badly portrayed \\, most of them makes no sense \\, you are forced to play the BBEG for a good chunk of the game . I litterally sat there and watched her die over and over again just for what she did to joel. Oh and Mr. Drukman inserting yourself in the game as the \\\"love interest\\\" of Abby combined with that 1 scene is really REALLY creepy. I give them 1 because i don't believe 0 exists.
