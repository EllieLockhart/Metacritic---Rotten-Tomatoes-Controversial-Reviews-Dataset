Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of plot holes\\, bad acting and really long. Visually stunning\\, its one of the best shot movies Iv seen but that alone doesn't make up for butchering one of the worlds most beloved stories. No respect for the ethos of star wars and no respect for the characters who are just unceremoniously killed off. Also I think they are trying to push a far left political agenda. Overall I am in mourning. So many missed opportunities.","true":true}
