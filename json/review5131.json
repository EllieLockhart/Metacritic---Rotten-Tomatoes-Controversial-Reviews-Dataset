Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Curved weapon trajectory in space\\,  Mary Poppins\\, males and the first Order are acting like idiots talents are ridiculous (some) and so on. I don't know what to say about the 91% average Rating do the watched the same movie or are they afraid of the Disney Empire? Maybe Disney is the first Order..","true":true}
