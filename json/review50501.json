Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"17 things wrong wif The Last Jedi (WARNING**Spoilers***):-\\n\\n1) Rey is nobody?!\\n2) What is Snoke n where did he come from?!\\n3) What is Luke been doing in the Island all this while?
