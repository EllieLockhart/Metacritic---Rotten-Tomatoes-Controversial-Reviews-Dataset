Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and saw this movie twice. I cannot walk away loving this movie. Too much went wrong. I don\u2019t understand how this movie could be so poorly done but it was. So many pointless scenes and bumbling story. Scenes reminded me of Return of The Jedi with Rey and Ren acting like Luke and Vader about to see the Emperor. I hope the next movie is so much better I can forget about this mess. May the Force be with making this train wreck go away. ","true":true}
