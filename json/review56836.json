Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many reasons that Rian Johnson's Star Wars the Last Jedi was garbage\\, but i will only list one. The way the director and Disney treated Mark Hammill\\, and luke Skywalker's character was actually offensive to me. JJ Abrams basically served up the most easy\\, well intended\\, and fan serving storyline involving Luke that anyone could hope to get\\, and Johnson basically took that and said\\, \\\"nah\\, screw the fans\\, screw the lore\\, and screw Mark Hammill\\\". If you watch this movie\\, keep that in mind.","true":true}
