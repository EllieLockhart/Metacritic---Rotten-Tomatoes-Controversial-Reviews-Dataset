Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't say too much because it would spoil the plot points.  I will say the movie is really good on its own.  One should not worry so much about where certain characters came from or traditional Star Wars story arch formulas.","true":true}
