Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is miles better than TFA\\, just setting JJ Abrams aside and keeping that monster from interfering\\, has produced a decent movie. There are no major continuity issues or incoherent scenes\\, so that's a great improvement over the mess of TFA. That said\\, the script remains quite bad. They keep making a copy of the original storyline\\, they spin it\\, switch it\\, repaint over it\\, but it's a poor choice nonetheless. The jokes seem misplaced\\, known characters seem out of character\\, and the new characters are not given anything to work with.\\nDaisy Ridley is a treasure\\, and again they misuse her\\, wasting an incredible opportunity.\\nOne thing they do right is female representation\\, all movies of all genres should look like TLJ in that regard.\\nHowever as a Star Wars flick\\, it's poor.","true":true}
