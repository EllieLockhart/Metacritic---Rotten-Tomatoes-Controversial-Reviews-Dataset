Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am so torn with this movie. I definitely cant give it 5 stars\\, its just meh for me. \\nLets go with the positives first\\nThe best part of the movie is Rey and Kylo.  \\nI like them both individually and I like the chemistry they bring together. Their scenes were really the best part of the movie\\n\\nThings I am on the fence with\\nLuke- I get it. You wanted him to be jaded.  But you took away everything about Luke that made him Luke.  A boy who felt that his dad had redemption in him after he tried to kill him but he didn't see that in Kylo? What had he scene before to think that way? \\nHe abandons everyone he loves?  He doesn't go after Snoke... ever? Why?  \\n\\nSnoke- Who is he ? Why is he so powerful.  \\n\\nHated:\\nFinn\/Rose storyline... So stupid and boring.  Doesn't add anything\\n\\nWhere does the story go?  I don't feel like the story has anywhere to go.  They kill off Snoke and now its Kylo?  Kylo doesn't scare me.  Its obvious with his connection with Rey there is some light in him.  \\n\\nToo many Plot holes","true":true}
