Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a fan of great writing. I'm a fan of Star Wars.. This movie is missing both. Episode VII because it felt like a remake of Episode III but it was better than this.\\n\\nThey blew their only chance to do something great with Luke's character. Instead\\, his importance is downplayed and his character is boring. He dies in the most boring way imaginable.\\n\\nThere was too much focus on Leia's character. It took both Anakin and Luke 2-3 movies to become badass Jedis. They had mentors who taught them how to use the force. Rey apparently didn't need training and could have easily bested Luke if she wanted to. Ridiculous. \\n\\nI could go on but why bother? The story sucked.\\n\\nAll things considered\\, Disney ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
