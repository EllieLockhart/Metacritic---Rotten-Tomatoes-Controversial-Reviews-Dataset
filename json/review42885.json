Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was shockingly bad. How can the critical average be so high? I loved The Force Awakens and Rogue One but this was just awful. Disney please do not let Rian Johnson touch another Star Wars project. I went into this film thinking that all of the criticisms I had heard about the movie were over blown but the opposite was true. So disappointed in almost every aspect of this film. I absolutely love Star Wars and I\u2019m crushed by how bad this movie is. ","true":true}
