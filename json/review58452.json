Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I want to say is that it is not a bad star wars movie. Its a garbage movie cinematographicly speaking. And im not a die-hard-the-original-triology-is-the-best-fan.Every production has its flaws as it is normal. But this one...JEEZ. Im a fan of movies in general and this was just a disaster. I entered the cinema with 0 expectations and still came out pissed. Useless\\, annoying and random characters doing useless\\, annoying and random sh*t\\, the so called \\\"war\\\" was the first order army versus a few petty resistance ships\\, still didnt explain why Rey is so goddamn overpowered\\, dumb\\, out of the blue situations that were just there for no reason (freeing the animals on the casino planet for example)\\, Snoke's death was pathetic\\, Luke became the Joker\\, Yoda firing lightnings and topless Kylo...seriously? These are just some thing that literally crashed in front of me and made the movie...just bad. And lets not forget the capital cinematographic failure of the year\\, the scene with princess Leia in space. You cant just make this sh*it up\\, nor can I forgive it for existing. At least if it had some cool saber fights\\, but no\\, just slo-mo clumsy swinging. To conclude\\, I consider this movie to be an absolute attrocity\\,   regardless of it being Star Wars or not.","true":true}
