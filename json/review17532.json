Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up for the first time just so that I could rate this movie.  As a child of the 70s\\, I've grown up with the Star Wars franchise.  So sad to see it faltering this way.  For the record\\, I've loved episodes II - VI (Episode I was OK).  However\\, I was sorely disappointed with this and The Force Awakens.  I've agreed with many of audience criticisms already posted here\\, so no need for me to rehash them.  I just wanted to add to the chorus and state that I too don't plan to waste money in the theater to watch the next one.","true":true}
