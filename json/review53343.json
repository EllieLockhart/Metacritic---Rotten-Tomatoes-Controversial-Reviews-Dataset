Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely very boring and too long\\, but the unacceptable apects are the loopholes in the plot and the poor character arcs. As a Star Wars fan\\, it's sad to see the way Disney has gone with the new films. The Force Awakens tried to be a carbon copy of A New Hope thus opening large gaps in the story\\, while this film doesn't fill in any of the plot holes and doesn't even follow the plots introduced in Awakens. Who is Snoke? How'd he come into power? Nevermind - he's really dumb and is now dead. How do people think the Jedi are a myth only 30 years later? Why does no one know about \\\"The Force?\\\" Nah - anyone can tap into the force at will without training - especially people that are nobodies\\, go to arguably the greatest Jedi for training\\, get denied said training\\, decide to go meet two of the most powerful people of the dark side\\, and are equally as matched to them and manage to kill everyone and escape unscathed. I'm not going to mention anything about Luke Skywalker's character arc because it's so ridiculously off target there are way too many things to even break down. So basically\\, it's a disaster and the writers should be embarrassed with their efforts.","true":true}
