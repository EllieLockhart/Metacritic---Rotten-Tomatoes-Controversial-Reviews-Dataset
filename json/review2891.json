Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, truly awful. This film makes literally no sense at all.\\nIt is not a sequel it's is a reboot to be watched in complete isolation to the first 6 films\\nThis is truly cynical corporate rebooting and shameful. Rian Johnson has killed Star Wars and created a new one. Critics are applauding and fans are disgusted. \\n\\nThere are so manyplot holes I can't list them\\, actually I can\\, All of it. Literally nothing in the entire film aligns to the previous 7 at all. Seriously at all","true":true}
