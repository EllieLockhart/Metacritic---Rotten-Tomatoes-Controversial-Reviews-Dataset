Now im going to be fair with this review the story was bold and the twist that the game had where the essentially turned abby into a joel 2.0 i thought really developed the character and made me feel compassion for her\\, however i did feel that her story felt like it dragged on forever and i just wanted to return to the theatre and continue as ellie.I think abbys story should of been a separate game kind of like a uncharted lost legacy\\, as i think that would of been a better approach to tell her tale leaving part 2 as a game where you play as ellie and joel after the events of the firefly massacre. overall i was left satisfied with the story as it was a good reminder of how revenge won't lead to happiness. I think the graphics audio and gameplay where very good gameplay was similar to the first as i expected. I gave this game an 8 as it did what a good game was suppose to it gave me a decent story and fun gameplay that kept me entertained its not perfect or a 0 its just a average game for a gamer to enjoy. i will say that the first game is better and i hope if there is a next week that it can return to its roots and continue a great series\u2026 Expand","true":true}
