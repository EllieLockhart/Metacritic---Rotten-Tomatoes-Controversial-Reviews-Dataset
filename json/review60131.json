We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First off\\, before you give any validation to negative reviews here\\, check the date. This game will take you approximately 25 hrs to beat\\, so anyone who published a review on the day it released\\, is either someone who never played it\\, or speedran through it\\, ignoring the story beats. That said\\, I love this game. I thought the story was great\\, gameplay solid\\, music and graphics are outstanding. I never felt like everyone we knew\\, would survive a second go around\\, to think so would be unrealistic in this apocalyptic world. That said\\, deaths were poignant and impact full. Pacing can be off at times. little things like safe cracking without the codes\\, and a characters fear of heights and how is it portrayed are a wonderful touch. As for length\\, I feel like they could have double dipped on us. By that i mean they could have put most of the second have out as dlc at a later date\\, but they didnt. I think we got two games in one here\\, and i am very happy with it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
