Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One star for the visuals; the rest is an absolute train-wreck of ludicrous attempts at nostalgia and the butchering of beloved characters from the originals. But what makes the film objectively bad are the plot-holes and contrivances that would take several hundred pages to enumerate and explain. Bring your own fan theories and  head canon if you want to make sense of this abomination.","true":true}
