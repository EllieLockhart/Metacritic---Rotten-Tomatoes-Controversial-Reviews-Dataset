Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If\\, before seeing this movie\\, you thought to yourself\\, \\\"What the blandest way I can make a bridging movie between The Force Awakens and the final movie in the trilogy\\, and what's the MINIMUM PLOT REQUIRED to get there?\\\" then spent millions producing the movie you just thought of\\, you would get The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThis was an hour long movie stretched into three hours of boring chases\\, uninteresting side plots\\, and the ruination of any mysterious or interesting story points. Ugh. I loved The Force Awakens\\, and I wish I had just gone to see this for free with my Movie Pass. I paid to see it on Thursday\\, because I was super worried about having the movie spoiler\\, but there's nothing to spoil! It's too boring for that!\\n\\nIf it wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, I may have rated it higher (maybe 2 stars\\, ooo!) but it's an absolute stumbler for the franchise\\, to me. To be fair\\, I enjoyed most of the Ray\/Ben\/Luke parts\\, and all of the actors did a good job with the scripts they were given. That script was just bad.","true":true}
