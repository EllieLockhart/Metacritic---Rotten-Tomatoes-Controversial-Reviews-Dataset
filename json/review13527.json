Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like I just paid \u00a35 to watch someone defecate on Luke Skywalker's face for over two hours.\\n\\nIt's visually beautiful\\, but I think they worked very hard indeed to alienate as many of their fanbase as was possible.\\n\\nI came out of the film rating about about a 7\/10\\, the more I think about it the more I dislike large parts of what they did. At best a 6\/10. By tomorrow as I think about it more I think my rating will go even lower.\\n\\nI bought my kids State Wars stuff\\, for Christmas.
