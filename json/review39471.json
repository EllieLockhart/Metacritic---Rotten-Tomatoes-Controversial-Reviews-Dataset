Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film really left me boring\\, almost falling asleep\\, and disappointing. I can see why Mark Hamill did not like the movie  and script in the first place and i believe him. The sub plot made no sense whatsoever and it was like all for nothing special. I even hear the crowd chant \\\"boring\\\" which is not good and they walked out in the middle of the theater. Every scene is over-saturated with this comedy humor that lacks the plot and characters. Its so mind boggling the filmmakers didn't even bother to look up \\\"Expanding Universe\\\" star wars books\\, which in my take alot better\\, and just scratch off with pile of wacky crap\\, the not good supporting characters especially the lady with a weird purple hair which cause some more heat. This is the first Star Wars movie that let me down and walk away. i could give this a zero star if i want to just to show how awful this movie is. But I'll leave a half star just to show how much effort they put in for all the wrong reasons.","true":true}
