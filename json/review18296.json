Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was incredibly well done. I think this served as the passing of the torch from a Luke's generation to Rey's. I thought the new direction and capabilities that the force is taking is great and shows creativity. Also the movie was not at all predicable which is good because I was worried that an 8th movie would just take ideas from other movies but I felt this movie did a nice job of creating a nostalgic and Star Wars feel while also being totally original. I release it has taken some heat by unsettled fans but I feel that their distaste is unwarranted because they are not considering the fact that it's a trilogy and this is just the second movie. Overall this was one of my favorite Star Wars films to date. ","true":true}
