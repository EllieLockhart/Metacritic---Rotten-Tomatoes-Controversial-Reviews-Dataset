Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, where to start....How about with the obvious. SPOILERS: The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Finn's entire side mission that was really just there to fill time\\, could have easily been removed and done without. All the major reveals lacked substance with the intent to be surprising. It's almost like Johnson and his writers decided to skip any backstory and just kill off anyone that the audience might be interested in. Other than failing to deliver on what should have been Star Wars moments\\, this film just shits all over what we've known as canon for years. Poor Abrams has his work cut out for him. Even the few chances the film has to redeem itself\\, like Finn crashing into the cannon\\, it goes the predictable route much like the Rey and Ren scene. This film took no risks in the big moments. Worth a watch maybe on DVD when it's in walmarts $5 bin. Until then don't get robbed suffering through this poor excuse for a SW movie.","true":true}
