Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes. Just destroys any plots or mystery left behind in TFA. Destroys Lukes character down to the very core of what the character stands for. Ignores the established lore. Man I could go on for hours. This movie was greatly disappointing. So let down. It's left the SW universe a mess.","true":true}
