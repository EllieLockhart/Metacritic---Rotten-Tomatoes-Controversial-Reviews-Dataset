Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie crushed my Star Wars spirit for reasons I cannot explain. Despite what many others thought\\, I loved The Force Awakens and if nothing else\\, it left most people with a bit of curiosity and maybe\\, optimism. I love Rey and I feel her arc was hurt by Finn and Rose's Candle Bight side story. Rather than expanding the depth of the characters we had been introduced to in Episode 7\\, more characters\\, multicultural and female were thrown at us simply to dodge the ridicule of our current society.  Meanwhile\\, Admiral Ackbar was blown up into the dismal abyss of space and only mentioned once after... I feel this was a tip off of what TLJ planned to do to the Star Wars Universe as a whole\\, at least Luke went out with a bit more dignity... not much but a little. All of the males in this film were either written to be chauvinistic blow hards (i.e. Poe\\, what were they thinking? This is not the same guy we met in Episode 7) or they were killed off. I was all for the girl power but not this way\\, not at the expense of the male  characters we have always loved or at the expense of the franchise itself. \\n\\nThe R2-D2 scene with Luke\\, the Porgs and the fact that this was Carrie Fisher's last appearance in a Star Wars film are the primary reason my rating is 2 stars and not 1.","true":true}
