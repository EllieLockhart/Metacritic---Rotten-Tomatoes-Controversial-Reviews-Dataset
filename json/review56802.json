Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people branding this film as epic or at par with The Empire Strikes Back must be 1) getting paid off by Disney or 2) totally disillusioned by fanboy-ism. These are the same people likely responsible for the host of unneeded Transformers' sequels. Admittedly there were some impressive visuals in this film (and some unimpressive)\\, however\\, there were too many missed opportunities in terms of the story's direction to make this film resonate with me the same way that other Star Wars films had. The film was plagued with a slew of issues\\, and even from an objective perspective The Last Jedi was just plain bad. Apart from debauchery of integral characters and the Star Wars ethos\\, there was one thing that really seemed misplaced; the comedy. Too much\\, too often and it felt quite forced and awkward. The film steps in a new-ish direction\\, but ultimately it is the wrong direction which has disenchanted many of us from the franchise.","true":true}
