Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insult to the saga and viewers on every level. This is the last Star Wars movie I will be paying to see. Rian Johnson and company should be ashamed of themselves for this garbage. This movie should immediately be wiped from canon. Beyond being a terrible Star Wars movie\\, on a basic story telling level it is completely flawed at every turn. Don't waste your money or your time (2.5 hours). The 90+ critic rating tells me that these critics have ulterior motives for giving such a score. Trust the viewers on this one gang.","true":true}
