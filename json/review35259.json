Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Good: Sound and visuals\\, excellent battle sequences\\, great ethnic diversity in the cast\\, Porgs were adorable and not overused\\nThe Bad: Horrible characterization of Luke\\, total misuse of Finn including throwing him into a horribly overlong subplot that dragged the movie down\\, uninteresting new characters like Rose\\,  take up precious screen time","true":true}
