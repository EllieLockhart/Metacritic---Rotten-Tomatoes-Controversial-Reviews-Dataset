Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It genuinely angers me how many people have been paid off or expect favor from reviewing this film favorably. The Last Jedi was an abomination. This 91% 'Certified Fresh' rating is FAKE. Do not see this film. Do not purchase fan merchandise. Do not support this marketing ploy and abuse of our love of a legacy. \\\"The raped Indie!\\\" ALL over again\\, and far worse. It is difficult to put in to words how disappointing this film was. I do not consider it canon.","true":true}
