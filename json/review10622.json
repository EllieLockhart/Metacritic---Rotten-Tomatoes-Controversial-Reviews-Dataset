Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had a couple of minor flaws that could not distract me from the impeccable acting and writing and bold direction the story went. Very unexpected but flows nicely and ultimately culminates in a powerful ending that leaves you wondering what will happen next. Don't trust the haters - see it yourself.","true":true}
