Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where The Force Awakens was a rehash of the original movies\\, this movie tried to be original but ended up filling the movie with useless scenes (Canto Bight)\\, poor writing (Holdo keeping her plan from Poe and the rest of the crew)\\, wasted character arcs (Finn and Poe) and gaping plot holes (that freaking lightspeed ramming!!). All in all\\, it is an original film\\, but one that makes a mockery of the vast scope\\, interesting plots and likeable characters of the first three movies and even the prequel trilogy.","true":true}
