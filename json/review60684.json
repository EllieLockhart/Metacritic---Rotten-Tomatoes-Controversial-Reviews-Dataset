Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Definitely a masterpiece. It\u2019s not what you want to see mate? Who cares? Have you watched the walking dead? Characters we learn to love also die there\\, and at times and circumstances deemed unfair. People who are leaving bad reviews here have either not completed the game or are too childish to grasp the not-so-popular storyline.  The game is about revenge\\, how far we can go in the pursuit of it. It\u2019s deep and thought provoking\\, not for children or people who can\u2019t read\/understand heavy content. The only aspect of this game I\u2019d change is the decision making element. I think it should be up the players what Ellie and Abby want to do as a result of they have seen and learnt throughout their journeys\\, specially whether Ellie should accept Tommy\u2019s proposal or even if she (we) should have killed Abby at the very end. Said that\\, this game is actually much deeper than I thought it would be and as such I give immense credit\/recognition to Naughtydog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
