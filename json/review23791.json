Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke throws away the lightsaber Rey hands him from the end of the last movie \/ beginning of this one. Perfect symbolism for how Rian Johnson throws away everything JJ Abrams set up for him from the last movie. Why ask an audience to invest in story lines\\, then spend two years speculating\\, only to throw them all away? Simply put\\, Disney  loses their credibility  with this film\\, as I will never again trust that their story lines are leading somewhere\\, and I will not waste my time theorizing about Star Wars anymore. Rian is the Emperor\\, and the \\\"professional\\\" critics & SJW's are the stormtroopers in Disney's evil empire\\, calling us the traitors\\, but we are the Mace Windus\\, calling out the true traitors!","true":true}
