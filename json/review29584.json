Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ruined it. It's up to JJ Abrams to save the trilogy that original Star Wars fans including myself have come to love. Please don't disappoint us. That being said\\, I'm not holding out much hope for the next installment. Sadly\\, I think that those of us who loved the original three films will never have our questions answered. Disney put its stamp on it. Enough Said.","true":true}
