Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say that hasn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t already been said? Sad excuse for a star wars movie. Ryan Johnson decides to take a very well known franchise and turn it into his own independent film project. He doesn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t own episode 8\\, he was a caretaker and he tried to make it his own. He drove the series into the ground and is in denial that it is a bad movie. If you don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t like it\\, Ryan and co will call you names and say you don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t like diversity in films. Did they not notice how well episode 7 did and it was very diverse and had a female lead.","true":true}
