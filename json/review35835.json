Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is one thing: shocking. If you want to see something new in Star Wars you will love it. The movie is beautiful\\, fast paced\\, and filled with memorable moments and twists. I was speechless coming out of the theater.","true":true}
