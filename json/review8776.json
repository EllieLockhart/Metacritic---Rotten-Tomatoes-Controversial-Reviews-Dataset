Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'Forced' humor and terrible character development in addition to the new pointless characters added truly ruined this movie for me. Easily the worst Star Wars to date.","true":true}
