Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never written a movie review before but I went through the sign up process just to stay how bad this movie is:\\n1. The entire movies time line made no sense. It was essentially an 18hr chase through space.\\n2. The subplot was the largest waste of time ever \\n3. Could you be any more obvious that the rich & white men Are the villains of this movie\\n4. How does a plumber become a main character \\n5. Who are we supposed to care about from original story line anymore?\\n6. Can I use the force with 0 training?\\n7. The force allows you to survive the void of space?\\n8. Kylo ren chooses not to kill his mom only to go kill his mom later...\\n9. Snoke... sweet\\n10. Luke saw a sliver of good in Vader and wouldn't kill him but his 15 year old nephew needs to die? You officially butchered every character possible.","true":true}
