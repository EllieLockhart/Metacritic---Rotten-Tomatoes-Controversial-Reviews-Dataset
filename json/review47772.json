Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When this movie first came out I was genuinely excited to see it. Although I did not like The Force Awakens\\, I loved Rogue One and figured after the first installment Disney would make a good second installment. I thought that Disney would use this movie as a chance to clear up some confusion surrounding Luke's disappearance\\, Kylo's turn to the dark side and Snoke's origins. Unfortunately this is not what we received. Instead the studio spends the entire movie building up to this idea (which I was actually not at all opposed to) that there would be an end to the jedi and the sith. Hinting that instead there would be some sort of new order that walked the line in-between and kept the balance (commonly known as the grey jedi among those who subscribe to Star Wars cannon). They alluded to this on multiple instances including when Luke called the jedi hypocrites who created their own downfall. Or when Yoda burned the tree holding the old jedi texts and claims that they were just old books and that Rey \\\"already had everything she needed.\\\" Or even (and I am most bitter about this one) when Rey and Ben (Kylo) had defeated Snoke and his royal guard and he (Ben) reaches for her hand and tells her that they can make a new world\\, exempt from the First Order and the Resistance. So badly did I want her to take his hand and have them work together to make a new order of grey jedi. Is this what they did? No\\, in an attempt to please everyone and keep the same old good versus bad concept\\, Rey refuses to take Ben's hand\\, insistent on the light side and Ben\\, in his rage\\, returns to the dark side. Meanwhile we watch Finn and Rose\\, some character who we are expected to care about because her sister died\\, (newsflash\\, its an action movie\\, lots of people die) run around looking for some master locksmith or something. In the end\\, the entire movie undoes itself with the master coder guy turns on them and Ben and Rey decide to call it quits on the development they experienced within themselves and with each other throughout the majority of the movie including their little force talks. The movie literally left off where it started. Luke doesn't teach Rey a dang thing\\, Kylo is some angry kid with identity issues again\\, and the Resistance and First Order still hate each other.  Nothing changed\\, except Han is still dead and now Luke and Snoke are dead too (thanks for the back story by the way). The only person (besides Chewie but anybody could wear the suit) who is still alive is Leia\\, and she's dead in real life. And don't even get me started on Leia being able to use the force all of a sudden. Do you know what would happen if you were sucked into the vacuum of space after having the part of the ship you were in blown up? I'm no physicist but I'm pretty sure you would AT LEAST get scratched by one of the thousand resulting pieces of debris floating through space. The only things keeping this franchise alive are fanboys who love it only because its Star Wars\\, and 12 year old kids. These new movies are practically ripoffs of themselves\\, and deserve no congratulations.","true":true}
