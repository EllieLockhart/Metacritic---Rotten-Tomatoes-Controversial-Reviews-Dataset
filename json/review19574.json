Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took a second viewing to get fully on board with this film\\, but it won me over in the end. The message that anyone can be the hero is one that has the potential to resonate for all generations of viewers. A few exchanges of bad dialogue and unnecessary exposition made me cringe\\, but it was equally balanced by some really amazing moments that could go down as some of the most memorable that this franchise has to offer. The Last Jedi is the perfect segway to the forthcoming bookend of the episodic Skywalker saga.","true":true}
