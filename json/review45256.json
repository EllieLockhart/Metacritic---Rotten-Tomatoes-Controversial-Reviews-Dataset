{"101487":191144,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(UPDATED: Again\\, another one of those who changed the review from 1\/2 star to 1 full star\\, though this film is not worth even 1\/2 star.  Doing this in order to ensure my review is counted as ROTTEN by rotten tomatoes). \\n\\n\\\"Everything this movie said.... was wrong\\\".   I have been a fan of this series since I was 8 years old\\, I have watched every movie multiple times\\, and though I found the prequels to be lacking and silly\\, I have watched them more than a few times.  The prequels were certainly a let down\\, but never have I been so disappointed in a Star Wars movie than this one.  \\n\\nThe film makers literally shoved their middle finger in my face and said :\\\"Everything you know about Star Wars\\, your hero Skywalker\\, the hero's journey\\, the lore\\, the history is all BS\\\".  THE 49% audience score as of this writing is way too high\\, I am utterly gobsmacked it is this high.\\n\\nIt is truly disgusting what this film has done to the franchise and the number of fans that will exit in the franchise will be in enormous.  I have no interest in seeing IX\\, or any other Kathleen Kennedy produced Star Wars film\\, period.   \\n\\nWhat went wrong.\\n\\n1. A plot that was neither interesting or compelling\\, one that was so full of holes it was like a prepubescent teen wrote the script.  Many if not most of the people who 'loved' this movie (as hard as that is to believe) often cite it is \\\"new\\, fresh\\, different than what we have seen before\\\".  O'really?  Lets see about this.  (*Spoilers*) The movie opens with the First Order attacking the Resistance base and the resistance fighters narrowly escaping (hmmmmm\\, where have see seen that before)\\, after the escape a chase ensues (hmmmmm\\, where have we seen that before\\, except in Empire Strikes Back it was much more exciting)\\, meanwhile our protagonist travels a great distance to find a Jedi master (hmmmmm\\, where have see seen that before)\\, our protagonist gets some teachings from the Jedi master (hmmmmmm\\, where have we seen that before except in TLJ she gets three lessons which actually turn into two lessons just after breakfast\\, one was why the Jedi should die and the other was about breathing then abruptly ended)\\, our protagonist then declares the antagonist still has good inside them and rushes off to turn them to the light side (hmmmmm\\, where have we seen that before)\\, when she gets there she is brought before his master (hmmmm\\, where have we seen that before)\\, our antagonist tempts our protagonist to join him (hmmmmm\\, where have we seen that before)\\, the antagonist kills his mentor (hmmmm\\, where have we seen that before).  THERE IS NOTHING NEW here\\, it is a rehash of prior plot elements assembled into an incoherent worthless plot line that takes a royal S**T on everything that is Star Wars.  \\n\\n2. Total character assassination (Skywalker)  and lack of major character development of the new 'crew' introduced in the Force Awakens\\, not to mention dimensionless new characters that add nothing to the story and bring back painful memory of Jar Jar Binks (Rose). \\n\\n3. Continuity problems abound with respect to FA.  Either plot lines were ignored or the were brushed aside like the were meaningless\\, yes\\, this idiot Rian Johnson has managed to not only make the worst Star Wars movie to date\\, but he managed to make the preceding movie worse than it was while at the same time elevating the prequels to a new status of \\\"goodness\\\" relatively speaking -- that takes a very special ineptness of talent. \\n\\n4. What is up with the horrid humor\\, it is like every other scene there is some tension destroying joke that falls flat and adds no meaning to the story\\, WTF.  In the original trilogy there was some humor\\, very little\\, but some and when it was used it was witty and well placed\\, not forced and flat and frankly majorly stupid.\\n\\n5. Leia Poppins'  - see the countless comments on how massively stupid that turned out. \\n\\n6. Luke sucking bluish green milk from the teat of a lactating sea monster ... come on.  \\n\\n7. Unbounded magic -- in many plot points of this pile of trash new force powers are invented out of thin air\\, no precedent\\, nothing in cannon to support this.  For example\\, force spirits calling lightning bolts.  Or new tactics in combat\\, such as to weaponize hyper-drive\/hyper-space.  Doing so automatically binds the next film in terms of 'the rules' and ruins previous films by opening enormous plot holes.  This simply exudes how poor the writing was and how much contempt the writer had for Star Wars history and legend.  Inventing new powers for the sake of new powers just to fit a contrived plot in once instance while ignoring all other established world building fact is simply bad writing.\\n\\nThis movie was thoroughly disgusting from the first frame to the last.  It stinks that RT does not allow negative stars\\, this is by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen.  Hands down.\\n\\nIt is shocking\\, given the utterly POOR writing and storytelling mechanics how many true idiots liked this POS.","true":true}
