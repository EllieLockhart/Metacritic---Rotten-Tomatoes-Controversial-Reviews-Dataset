Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Note: I've had a different reaction to The Last Jedi after seeing it a second time. My thoughts on the film has changed as has my star rating\\, which has moved down.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi (2017) ??? \/ ???? Sequel to THE FORCE AWAKENS finds Rey (Daisy Ridley) attempting to convince master Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to fight alongside the resistance\\, but Luke feels that would do no good. She also discovers more about a conflicted Sith (Adam Driver). Both during the war against the empire.  This all ties together in surprisingly credible fashion. While the ending is a mixed blessing\\, and the story stretches out far beyond its limits\\, the film manages to crank out enough attention-getting\\, agreeable surprises and excitement that it still ranks as passable escapism.","true":true}
