Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe what I just sat through. Do you like your Star Wars with the deadening weight of potty humor and one liners thrown into every scene? Battles and 'plot lines' that go nowhere? Zero sychronicity of timing\\, story flow\\, or overarching narrative? Im going to pretend this film didnt happen. This movie trashed what Force Awakens and Rogue One managed to accomplish.","true":true}
