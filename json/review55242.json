Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just seen Star Wars\\, channelling modern liberalism against the dark authoritarian overlords\\, the simplistic good vs evil replaced by moral quandaries and blurred lines. \\n\\nNo more simplistic rebel hero's verses the black clad fascist storm troopers..\\n\\nInstead there is room for a bit of anti arms trade universal condemnation of power and war and a nod to political survival over set piece military sacrifice. \\n\\nDown with blunt testosterone male courage in lieu of feminist leadership. \\n\\nMeanwhile in the actual movie rather than the theology subplot the breathless attention deficit defying action grates on the admittedly humorous asides.\\n\\nThere could have been flashes of thought provoking brilliance but by the end the script's vocab range dies faster than a millennial's whatsapp group. \\n\\nFlashes of brilliance\\, but in the end attempts too much over too long.","true":true}
