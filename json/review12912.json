Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think you could make a worse film than the force awakens\\, how wrong I was. From start to finish this film can't decide on a tone\\, has ruined what little interest I had in any of the characters or plot threads and killed off everyone that was interesting.  When the movie-going public descends upon Lukasfilm and drags the people responsible for this film into the street and slaps two telephone poles together to crucify them\\, I will be there to personally hand them the nails.","true":true}
