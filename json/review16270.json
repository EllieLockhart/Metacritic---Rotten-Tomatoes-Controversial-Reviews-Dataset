Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going into detail as I don't want to  give any spoilers but here goes.... It wasn't the best Star Wars film I've ever seen but it was far from the worst by a long way. Episodes I & II win that crown for me by a country mile. It had some silly bits involving milk and an odd bit of Mary Poppins style magic which I could have lived without but overall it entertained me. Great space battles\\, a good lightsaber battle\\, I loved the white\/red visuals during the final battle\\, and the hyperspace destruction sequence and I still well up whenever I see the Millenium Falcon. I like Poe and Finn\\, I struggle to take teenage emo Kylo seriously and Rey I'm still to decide on. I'm hoping Del Toro's character will come back for the next episode he was fun and Rose was a nice addition. I'm sure JJ will come up with something better next time!","true":true}
