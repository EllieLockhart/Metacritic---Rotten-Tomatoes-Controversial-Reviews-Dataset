Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many dropped subplots from TFA and plot holes of it's own big enough to drive a Buick through.  The writing is jarringly didactic during certain chunks of the runtime.  Jokes that feel like they're from an SNL sketch  \\nIt's a thematically strong\\, but a narratively weak movie- albeit a very visually well crafted one.","true":true}
