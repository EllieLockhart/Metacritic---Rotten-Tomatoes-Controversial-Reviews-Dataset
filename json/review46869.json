Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well went to the opening night\\, I loved it\\, yes there are bits they could have changed but I would rate this film as probably the 3rd best behind Empire and A New Hope. The problem is that it is very hard to deliver a Star Wars film that people will wow at as we have seen numerous films and TV shows over the last 30 years that opened our imagination to sci-fi space films. For those fans who have poured cold water on it I am not sure what they wanted to see? I say go see it and if you enjoyed the others then there is no reason you will not love this as well.","true":true}
