Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was awful. Completely destroyed the star wars universe.  It's ok to move on to the future\\, but in the process there is no need to step all over the past.  My children were so let down by this movie and seriously doubt that the franchise is salvageable at this point.  Too many plot holes\\, and the tone has become completely uneven with the unnecessary jokes...it's almost as if the writer is making fun of fans that cherish and love the series so much.","true":true}
