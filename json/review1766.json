Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I was hoping for more after my  disappointment in the force awakens  this film only made it worse\\, Rian Johnson both  Director and writer only copied parts from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi to tell a new story but it's clearly  obvious  that is to everyone except the critics who seem to love it\\, thus far neither new film offers anything new\\, the Prequels are more original  then these movie that wish to relive past glory with poor execution","true":true}
