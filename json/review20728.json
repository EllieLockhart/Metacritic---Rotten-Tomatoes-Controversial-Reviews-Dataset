Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out of the theater the after the first timr watching the film being drained and confused. But\\, after I started thinking about what I saw\\, I loved it more and more. After seeing it a second time though\\, all the flaws I had before faded away. It felt more whole. It's just under Empire Strikes Back for me.","true":true}
