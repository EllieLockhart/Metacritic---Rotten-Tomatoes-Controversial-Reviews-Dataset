Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"all the build ups from force awakens are meaningless\\, snoke is a bitch\\, rey is nobody which is fine but that isn't where the arc seemed like it was headed. luke goes out like a chump after being a grumpy hermit for two hours. would have been a good stand alone\\, but will ruin the trilogy.","true":true}
