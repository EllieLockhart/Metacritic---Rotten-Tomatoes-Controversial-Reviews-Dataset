Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie. Tarnishes everything that Luke stood for in the OT. Puts stupid one-liner humor made for fair-weather Star Wars fans above good\\, coherent story telling and character development. I made a Rotten Tomatoes account purely to write this review. I will be boycotting Solo in hopes that true lovers of the Star Wars universe will follow suit and get Cathleen fired. You should've taken a page out of Marvel's book and actually\\, oh\\, I don't know\\, had a plan for the trilogy? A SERIOUS disappointment. Shame on you Cathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson. May the force be with you\\, Carrie <3","true":true}
