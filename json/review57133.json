Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review.  Like many disgruntled lifetime fans\\, I felt compelled to review this movie and I don't know where to start.  Whether it's completely ignoring the exciting plot points from The Force Awakens or abandoning the central theme of Star Wars (which at its heart is a Space Opera about the Skywalker clan)\\, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi seems bent on making Star Wars something new - no matter what the cost.  Sadly\\, it seems that all he has done is ruin something special to so many.  Disney has already agreed to make a new trilogy that doesn't follow the Skywalkers.  I fail to see why they had to destroy the Star Wars legacy in this film to do that.  Whether making Rey a nobody or pointlessly killing Luke solely to focus on new characters\\, this movie is the most thoroughly disappointing Star Wars entry to date.  I understand Disney wants to make money expanding the Star Wars universe\\, but disenfranchising lifelong fans hardly seems the best way of doing so.  Luke Skywalker\\, possibly the most iconic figure in film history\\, deserved far better.  So did the fans.  I never thought a Star Wars film would be worse than the Phantom Menace\\, but I was wrong.","true":true}
