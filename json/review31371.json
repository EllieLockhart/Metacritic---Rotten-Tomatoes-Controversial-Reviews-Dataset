Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"somehow johnson made a movie i truly hate.  someone on twitter brilliantly stated\\, 'do not see the movie\\, watch the trailers and imagine what happens.'  i truly wish i never saw this travesty.  i cannot remember the last film i 'hated' but i hate this movie.  in art\\, a 'polarizing' review is what you want\\, so i might be helping this fool by hating it.  johnson is a selfish prick writer\\, who thinks he 'owns' the characters.  thats his mistake.","true":true}
