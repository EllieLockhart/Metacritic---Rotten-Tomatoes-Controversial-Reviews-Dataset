Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love this movie.. Love the new direction being brought into the franchise. Kylo\\, Rey\\, and especially Luke were outstanding. The acting\\, cinematography\\, visuals\\, and story were all great. I like that we see new sides to the Force as well. This one has heart\\, humor\\, twists and makes you think. I like that.","true":true}
