Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fine movie.  Seemingly a pastiche of corporate marketing research (and maybe one person's alien titty fetish?)\\, it was fun enough.  Enjoyed Laura Dern having fun and looking stunning as always in here alien gown. Still do not understand how Adam Driver is a professional actor. A lot of the fighting was shot very sloppily but kudos to some badass saber tricks. The whole story was meaningless in the grand arc of the star wars mythos. Nothing changes! Whatever\\, gimme more porgs.","true":true}
