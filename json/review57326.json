{"101487":184871,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is missing the point of Star Wars\\, thinking that is all about the force\\, substituting the political statements they made with Disney humor and a criticism to the rich with no real consequences to the main plot\\, if there ever was one. A great example would be when Padme said\\, \\\"This is how democracy dies\\, with thunderous applause\\\". Great dialogue\\, direct political statement\\, contribution to the main plot. It made sense.\\n\\nThe original movies and prequels are political movies in every way. George Lucas said in multiple interviews that the original Star Wars trilogy is his interpretation of the Vietnam War\\, Nixon and democracies becoming dictatorship. Lucas wanted everyone to know his movies were about how much he disagreed with the United States government. In the prequels\\, the famous quote \\\"if you are not with me\\, you are my enemy\\\" is a quote from George W. Bush when he invaded Iraq. And I think he even based Luke Skywalker on Jimmy Carter\\, the president commonly known as \\\"the farmer boy\\\". So yeah\\, at its core\\, Star Wars is a political film. George Lucas was not afraid of getting those themes involved in his films. Even though Luke is a main focus\\, the original trilogy is about the group of rebels\\, the trio\\, we didn't get that in this film. You can actually take away Finn's arch\\, Poe's arch\\, and it doesn't affect the film. They are irrelevant to the plot. This movie isn't about the last Jedi\\, it's about Kylo Ren and his character development\\, which I think was the only good thing in this movie. And then Luke\\, I still can't understand how they threw all his character development from the original trilogy and gave us this. A guy who refused to kill a member of his family in Return of the Jedi\\, now tried to kill a member of his family out of fear. It's so out of character. These are things that just don't make sense. And in terms of training\\, Luke spent approximately 1 week with Yoda and when he left he couldn't even lift his X wing fighter\\, it was obvious he was not prepared at all. He went to fight Vader\\, left dismembered\\, and almost dying. But hey\\, let's Mary Sue Rey and bam\\, she can now lift more than a hundred rocks with the Force and have a battle leaving without a scratch and ready to fly the Millenium Falcon with no explanation whatsoever on how she managed to escape. If at least they gave us some new relevant information to which justify this film\\, but no. When you can take away 2 hours from a movie and not affect the plot\\, you know how bad a movie really is. It's an empty movie\\, with nothing to contribute. Literally nothing is resolved.","true":true}
