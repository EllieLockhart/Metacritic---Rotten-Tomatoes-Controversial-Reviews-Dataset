Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Single handedly did what Lucas could not do.  Destroy the saga.  It was a bad movie.  Being PC didn't kill terrible choices with arc that were set\\, lore for an entire franchise universe.  Awful.","true":true}
