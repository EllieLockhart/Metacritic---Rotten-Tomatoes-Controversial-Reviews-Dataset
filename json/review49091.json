Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever\\, how Rian Johnson got his own trilogy is beyond me. Probably won't watch the next one in a theatre because the new trilogy is garbage now... Thank you Disney and thank you Rian Johnson for ruining Star Wars","true":true}
