Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will put this down below the Ewok movies. This was the worst STAR WARS movie I have ever seen. Ever single plot line that we were looking forward too since our childhood\\, the writers flushed down the toilet. \\nThis was supposed to be epic like Empire Strike Back answering questions and the crowd leaving 'NO WAY'. Instead\\, we left with no questions because the movie said \\, \\\"all your questions don't matter.\\\" The physics of this movie were terrible. The story was nothing but a boring \\\"car chase\\\" in space. This movie seem to have a great climate seen every twenty minutes\\, then the exact opposite happen\\, making the movie worse. The story of Episode 8 was basically: Gotcha.\\nLastly they just wrote out the last of the remanding character in this movie. The is no reason for a part 9. Part 9 story should be about Leia and what real happens to Luke. That is Star Wars. All these new characters are just side characters to this long story\\, and the writers have forgotten that.","true":true}
