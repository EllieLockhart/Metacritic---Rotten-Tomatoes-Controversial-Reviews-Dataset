Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You might be able to argue it's a good movie\\, but if you understand the history and style of Star Wars then it's a bad movie. Basically it's a fan-boy with a blank check: Hey\\, my bad guy is better than your bad guy\\, hey look what my Force can do!","true":true}
