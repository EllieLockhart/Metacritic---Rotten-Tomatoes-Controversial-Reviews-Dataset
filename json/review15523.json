Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it\\, the story was good\\, the acting was great\\, the effects and soundtrack just as good as ever. The film has a couple flaws and I can see where most old fans and purists are disappointed in seeing something out of the norm for the Star Wars formula\\, but that's exactly why I liked it\\, it wasn't predictable nor clich\u00e9 and the plot twists were great. The only aspect I truly didn't like was how there was no backstory or development of Snoke at all. I also wasn't a fan of the Finn\/Rose subplot but I didn't hate it. The rest was great.","true":true}
