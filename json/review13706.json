{"101487":132067,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally went ahead and watched again after I was so disappointed with it at the cinema. And guess what? The last Jedi is definitely not like a fine wine. It is a horrible movie that destroyed the legacy of several key figures. It introduced several useless characters and had several story lines that made no sense or didn't add anything at all. And don't get me started on dropping bombs in space and turbo lasers having trajectory arc in space. Ridiculous.","true":true}
