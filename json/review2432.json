Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very disappointing instalment. And the first time I\u2019ve fallen asleep on the cinema in a very long time. The plot is confused\\, the characters have nothing to do and the story makes no real progress. This seems like an exercise in money making and nothing else . I am so very disappointed as I was really looking forward to this film ","true":true}
