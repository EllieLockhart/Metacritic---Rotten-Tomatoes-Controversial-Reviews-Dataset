Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filme cont\u00eam todos os elementos que fizeram de SW o sucesso que \u00e9 hoje. Muito emocionante\\, cheio daqueles milissegundos nost\u00e1lgicos.","true":false}
