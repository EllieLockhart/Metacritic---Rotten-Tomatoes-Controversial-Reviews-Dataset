Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand all the hate around \\\"The Last Jedi\\,\\\" I really do. But not only did I actually like the film\\, I think in the long run it will be good for the franchise. A movie that brought life back into a franchise that was stuck in the past.","true":true}
