Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is an amazing movie\\, with a very simple\\, straightforward main plot\\, with near impeccable execution.\\n\\nI left the theater already planning to see it again. The soundtrack is magnificent\\, with John Williams in fine form.","true":true}
