Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took me three attempts to watch this trainwreck of a movie. The plot was somehow even worse than the reviews claimed. The soundtrack might have been the best so I give the movie 1\/2 a star for that.","true":true}
