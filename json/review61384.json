Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I feel people are being unfair to this game. I\u2019ll start with what I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t like the sections that you play as Abby. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re poorly written\\, I\u2019m just uninterested in her life and finding out her backstory does not give me any remorse for her. It\u2019s a sad world and bad things happen to good people. Although I do understand why she would be so upset\\, it doesn\u2019t make me want to brutalize her and her friends any less. I don\u2019t want to play as the villain who\u2019s done such brutal things to characters that I love. I think some people are upset cause you play as a play lesbian. I don\u2019t think everyone who dislikes the game is homophobic\\, I just think that if it were a man and a woman no one would bat an eye at it. I hear a lot of people saying things like \\, \u201cI don\u2019t mind that they\u2019re lesbian I just don\u2019t like that a gaming platform is being used for politics. \u201c. To me that means that deep down you don\u2019t like that they\u2019re lesbian even if you don\u2019t want to admit it. I\u2019m also seeing people saying that this game is too dark. In the first game your daughter gets murdered in your arms\\, you almost get eaten by cannibals\\, and you doom the human race. I think people just aren\u2019t used to see the characters they love die in such brutal ways and I agree it was awful. That\u2019s what makes the game so compelling. I\u2019ve been watching reviews online too and I can almost guarantee some of these guys haven\u2019t finished the game so their opinion is really invalid\\, but they get to go online and trash it anyways.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
