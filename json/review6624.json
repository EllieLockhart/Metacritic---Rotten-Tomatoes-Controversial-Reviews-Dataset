Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not trust the TOMATOMETER ! it got bot'd to give 5 star reviews from people like marvel CHARACTERS\\, Dead PRESIDENTS\\, CHARACTERS from tv series like saul goodman. I PERSONALLY wish I HAD never seen this movie it was just insulting to a fan intelligence and had no continually with old story ... and actually breaks the lore !!","true":true}
