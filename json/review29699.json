Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took some big risks with The Last Jedi. I respect the heck out of him and lucasfilm for letting him do that. Some of those risks didn't pay off\\, but more did than not. Nonetheless - I fully enjoyed the unexpected breathe of fresh air. Where The Force Awakens was a re-run of the same exact plot lines of the original\\, this one took the story in a very different direction while still have a few well time call backs to the originals. They broke down characters you thought you knew\\, and really fleshed them out and rebuilt them. I think it worked really really well\\, as The Last Jedi proves triumphant.","true":true}
