Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few good moments but the rest was terrible. The plot was pretty much shambles. It's like rian took J.J.'s directing notes from the force awakens and threw them in the trash. I really liked the force awakens\\, but the follow up was garbage. Hopefully the next one turns it back around\\, and they seriously rethink giving rian his own trilogy.","true":true}
