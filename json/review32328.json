Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has hit a low I never thought was even possible. I saw this movie twice and watching it a second time just made it even worse. As a huge Star Wars fan\\, I tried so hard to like this movie\\, but it failed in almost all categories. The movie is driven on continuous plot conveniences and has countless plot holes. All of the characters were lazily written and uninspiring. There was no satisfying ending to any of the plot points and some plot points from episode 7 were completely ignored. The movie continuously contradicts the rules and lore in the originals and prequels. Even worse\\, it contradicts itself a few occasions. The writing of the script felt childish. Words like \\\"tooling\\\" and \\\"unfindable\\\" have no place in Star Wars. The numerous attempts at comedy failed miserably. They felt so out of place and ruined the immersion. \\nHonestly\\, I don't understand how Lucasfilm allowed this. The only good thing this movie had going for it was the visuals and soundtrack. Visual quality will pass in time\\, but a great story is timeless. I am not looking forward to Episode 9.","true":true}
