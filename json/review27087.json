Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most ridiculous aspects regarding this movie are the critics reviews. 91% approval on RT? Really? Come on now. It doesn't take someone with a master's degree in writing to know that this movie is terribly written and an insult to the intelligence of any one over the age of 10. Multiple examples of deus ex machina\\, plot holes you could fit the Falcon through\\, uneven pacing\\, poor dialogue and character development\\,\\, ignoring space physics\\, useless subplots\\, and Rey being the ultimate Mary Sue are all signs that TLJ is not going to be up for any literary awards. Actually wait- I take that back- watch it win best original screenplay at the Oscars- that's how ridiculous Hollywood is. It is glaringly obvious that these so called \\\"critics\\\" have been bought and paid for by the Disney corporate machine. Disney- do us all a huge favor and stop cramming your SJW views down our throats. The irony of the message you're trying to put out there is not lost on the audience- we are smarter than you think. I guess the saddest part of this movie is how Disney and Rian totally and utterly disrespected Mark Hamill and the legacy of Luke Skywalker. It was truly painful to watch.","true":true}
