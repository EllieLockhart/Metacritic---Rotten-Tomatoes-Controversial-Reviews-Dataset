Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Undermines everything that came before it without offering anything new or inventive enough to justify doing so. Does its best to make not only itself but also The Force Awakens a waste of time.  Far too many misplaced comedy moments. Characters are wasted and storylines are pointless and go nowhere.","true":true}
