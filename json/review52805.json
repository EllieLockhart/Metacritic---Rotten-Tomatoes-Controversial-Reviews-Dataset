Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of fancy special effects and some nice twists. However\\, from a story perspective it was a very predictable movie. It's \\\"the middle movie\\\": you add the Jedi training\\, the mentor (that doesn't want to be the mentor)\\, the former hero dying to let the new generation have its place. We've seen that very same thing before. For me Star Wars is Luke Skywalker\\, I went to see the move to reconnect with my childhood hero. Neither Episode 7 or 8 have established these new characters\\, I couldn't care less about them. Now that Luke\\, Han and Leia are dead there's no reason for me to see any of the future movies.","true":true}
