Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had to fast forward through some of the movie\\, which I've NEVER done in my lifetime. Worst Star Wars Movie I have EVER seen. Even the Prequels were masterpieces next to this horrible movie. Oh I disliked the Prequels.","true":true}
