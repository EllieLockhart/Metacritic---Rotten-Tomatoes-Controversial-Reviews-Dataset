Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think people really underrate this movie. Sure\\, it isn't great.... The pacing is kinda bad\\, and I can also see how this could be disappointing to a dedicated star wars fan. The scenes on Canto Bight are really bad. Although\\, I see where Rian Johnson was going. He was trying to change Finn from someone who just cared about himself (in Episode 7) to someone who really saw the negative effects of the empire. This leads to him willing to give his own life for the cause later in the movie\\, which is really beautiful. I'm really disappointed\\, though\\, that they didn't let him die\\, considering he did next to nothing in episode 9. I really liked how Luke died\\, along with that final battle. I love the direction Rian Johnson was taking the series as he made the light\/dark side a little less black and white. Episode 9 just forgot all of that\\, of course. The light speed ramming scene was absolutely magnificent. I really didn't like Vice Admiral Holdo\\, as well as the fact that she just blatantly didn't tell Poe her plan\\, leading to that enormous waste of time and wasted of a plot line. Overall\\, this is a underrated\\, not very good\\, but exceptional in many areas\\, movie.","true":true}
