Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing movie... In the force awakens\\, they led the audience in a very specific mysterious direction. Just to shit all over it in the last Jedi. The decisions they made and the explanations they gave for certain characters was such a let down. I left the theatre scratching my head and completely disappointed with Disney\u2019s and Rian Johnson\u2019s version of the story. They completely botched Luke\u2019s character and turned him into the opposite of what he was in the original trilogy. Just overall flabbergasted by this movie. ","true":true}
