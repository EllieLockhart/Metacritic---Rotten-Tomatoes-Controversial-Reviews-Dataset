Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some amazing and memorable scenes... really satisfying to watch... but too much comedy and some really awkward stuff and things that just don't add up. I was disappointed. I really wanted to love it. The plot was not moved forward from ep 7 and worse some stuff was undone.","true":true}
