Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only a real fan knows what Anakin's lightsaber represents\\, but not Rian Johnson for him has no value and puts the most important character in the film culture as an idiot\\, to give an end to the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy rather than worthless. That is not the Luke I grew up with\\, I dreamed of being and that I spent so many years waiting to see him again. This movie is decanonized by me !!!","true":true}
