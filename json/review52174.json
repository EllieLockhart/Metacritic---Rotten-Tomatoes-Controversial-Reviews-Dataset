Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After two showings\\, this movie remains a confusing and bloated mess. The plot pivots jarringly from whatever setup The Force Awakens provided in an effort to \\\"subvert expectations\\\" and ends up not being able to satisfactorily explain itself along those lines. Rian Johnson seems to simply change things just to be different from TFA and provides little rhyme or reason for those changes. The characters are provided no explicable motivation for any of the actions they take and pure stupidity seems to be the central theme of their behavior. There are scenes that invoke painful memories of the prequels and then do nothing to salvage themselves.\\n\\nJ.J. Abrams will have a lot of work ahead to salvage this trilogy - the first two installments almost seem to be two separate movies at this point.","true":true}
