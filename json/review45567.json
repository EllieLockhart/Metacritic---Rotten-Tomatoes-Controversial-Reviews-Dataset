Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. I actually woke up the next morning with a feeling of regret (the kind you get from a bad\\, drunk night of decisions).  Grew up with Star Wars\\, I really like TFA\\, but TLJ REALLY let me down in a lot of ways...please Disney\\, fix this somehow.","true":true}
