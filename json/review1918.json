Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AS just a movie it was kind of good i guess but the problem is this was not supposed to be just a movie\\, it was supposed to be a star wars movie and as that it failed in many ways. With all my problems with this movie my biggest one is that Luke's character was completely destroyed. In the first movies he always had hope and he never gave up. In this movie he is shown as this depressed retired old man in a mountain for some reason. Remember how Obi Wan tells Luke how important light sabers are. Well in this movie he when Rey hands him the light saber he basically just throws it away.","true":true}
