Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I refused to buy a ticket to see this because I'd heard bad stuff but then a friend bought 3 tickets and gave me a spare. Man\\, he was SO pi$$ed off by this movie!  I never seen him so angry in my life. He was kicking his car and swearing while I laughed! \\n\\nI heard it was bad but DAAAAAMMMMNN..... This.... was.... BAAAAD!\\nSeems most feel the same way. In fact how is the audience score 49%?  \\nEven bigger question: How the hell is the critical score 90%!  Man! If your gonna bribe critics at least do it subtly! Lol!","true":true}
