Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the official trailers for The Last Jedi\\, Luke is seen saying one of his lines in the film\\, \\\"This is not going to go how you think.\\\"  And indeed\\, The Last Jedi takes expectation and twists them into something new and exciting.  While some fans seem to be disappointed that the story didn't follow the plot as they saw it\\, the exciting directions taken with Luke\\, Rey and most interestingly Kylo Ren make for a truly dynamic film that left me exhilarated.  \\n\\nWhile several moments with these characters are surprising\\, the turns are believable and work well within the characters and their storylines.  \\n\\nThe film isn't perfect\\, and there are some pacing issues in the first half that soften the impact of the front half of the film.  However\\, starting with a showdown that is\\, perhaps the very best scene in any Star Wars film\\, the film takes off and doesn't let up until the finish.  The complexity of the main characters\\, both hero and villain\\, make this more than just your standard good vs. evil sort of film that the previous Star Wars films have taken\\, and left me wanting more.","true":true}
