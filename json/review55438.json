Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mediocre. It feels like it was written by a committee to be what they thought most people would like. Almost everything is a retread of scenes from the original trilogy\\, but with the characters acting out of character. Some good action scenes but overall not a worthy entry in the Star Wars saga. It feels more like a generic Marvel movie and lacks the magic of Star Wars. The humor was mostly wrong and out of place. This isn't Guardian of the Galaxy. There are too many cutesy animals and kids. Established characters behave out of character or are completely wasted. For some reason Yoda acts like the crazy creature Yoda pretended to be when Luke first met him on Dagobah\\, not the wise Jedi master he is. It was terrible. It's like the director hasn't even watched the earlier movies and doesn't understand Luke\\, Leia\\, Yoda\\, R2\\, Chewie or 3P0.  The newer characters don't progress either. The end up in the same place as they were at the end of Force Awakens. We don't learn anything of the mythology started in Force Awakens. Snokes is completely wasted with no explanation. Kylo goes nowhere. Neither does Rey. The more I think about it\\, the more disappointed I am. This is the Disnefication of Star Wars\\, geared strictly to put out as many movies as possible and turn Star Wars into a generic formulaic franchise like Marvel.","true":true}
