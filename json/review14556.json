Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like change\\, but I also like a good light sabre fight amongst the main characters\\, this was lacking that\\, and that is why I like watching Star Wars\\, so a bit disappointed but I like the potential.","true":true}
