Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fact that this movie is ranked twice as high by the \\\"critics\\\" as it is by its audience only shows that Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites are paid off by Disney to say nice things about it and sell the movie.\\n\\nWell\\, sadly\\, this is not only worse than Attack of the Clones\\, but worse than any Sci-fi movie of the entire decade. Don't waste any time or money on this trite. If you simply must see a Sci-fi\\, watch Passengers. At least they know how to write a plot.","true":true}
