Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its was a bit fun and I enjoyed it ( its Star Wars) but there are so many problems with it. It needed a major rewrite before it was made. Over all it was a disappointment and major parts of it were just stupid. It was a disservice to the star wars universe \\,beloved characters and fans.","true":true}
