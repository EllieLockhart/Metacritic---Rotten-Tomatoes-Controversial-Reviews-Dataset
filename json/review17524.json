Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I should've listened to the audience and ignored the critics.\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi is aggressively bad. Its almost HOSTILE in its treatment of the audience. I mean there are movies that just \\\"suck\\\" and then there are movies that seem set out to offend and give you the finger.\\nThis fell into the latter category.\\n\\nOthers have expressed its faults better than I could. I'll just say: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!","true":true}
