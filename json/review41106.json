Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so many disappointing movements that I was ready to walk out several times! From the forced (and not funny) humour\\, to the silly plot (really? A space chase?)\\, to the very shallow characters. There is so little to like here... so very very little. The attempt at humour was even on the border of inappropriate (yes the milking scene comes to mind). If Lucas would have known that SW would turn into this... well he would have asked for 40B instead of 4B.","true":true}
