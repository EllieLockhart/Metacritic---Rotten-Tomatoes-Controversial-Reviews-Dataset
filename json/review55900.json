Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember Luke Skywalker ? He was the humble young man that suffered great tragedy and hardship\\, but who through great heroism\\, friendship\\, mysticism and a harnessing of his innate gifts\\, triumphed over evil and brought about peace in the universe. He was a man that with Leia\\, Han\\, and others\\, inspired us\\, raised our spirits high above the mundane and taught us that good truly can overcome evil.\\n\\nYeah\\, well\\, his efforts and his adventures were a waste of time. Han died\\, the universe was quickly reset right back to where it was\\, and Luke became a cynical misanthropic hermit suckling blue milk from the tit of a giant space walrus for breakfast on a desert planet.\\n\\nBasically that's what this film tells us.\\n\\nSo why should we care about these characters\\, new and old? Even if they win\\, things will only going to be reset once again.\\n\\nAll the things that the previous film teased us with - the mysteries\\, the unanswered questions - were left unanswered\\, killed off willy nilly\\, or relegated to pointless subplots in Casino prequel land. Instead\\, what was crammed down our throats was the message that women are better\\, men are fools\\, and that Star Wars is a bit of a joke anyway hence the self-parodying and endless misplaced gags.\\n\\nBut the biggest crime of this film was to reassemble the original cast and not even give them a scene together. Yeah\\, yeah\\, Luke and Lea had 30 seconds of stilted dialogue at the end\\, but by that point we were so bludgeoned by insipidity for the 2.5 hour running time\\, all we cared about was when it would end so we could go to the toilet.\\n\\nThe only thing this film had going for it were the special effects\\,  art\\, costumes\\, a couple of poignant scenes and of course the music. But without any substance\\, even John Williams's music felt like so much nothing\\,","true":true}
