Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining movie\\, but Star Wars is now the new Star Trek. Instead of a good sci-fi story they took the issues of today and built a story around that which is classic Star Trek. Star Trek was entertaining and so was this movie\\, but it wasn't Star Wars.
