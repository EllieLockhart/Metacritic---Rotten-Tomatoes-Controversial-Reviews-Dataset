A story of: Racism Homophobia love Anger Vengeance disparities Inequality Remorse inhumanity Where the strongest survives ... but who is really the strongest? Is he the one who dominates or the one who succumbs? From fear comes true strength. She who amplifies every human sensor and elevates it to the cube.

Only when we are weak do we find our true strength. Abandon the past\\, regrets\\, to find one's humanity and finally be free. Revenge is always exhausting. Its consequences are bleak. It is better to focus on future hope rather than past pain.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
