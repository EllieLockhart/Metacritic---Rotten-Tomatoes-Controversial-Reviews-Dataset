Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A perfect epic masterpiece that moves on from the same thing shown in every SW movie and adding something new while staying true to the story of the Force. Only original SW fans can truly appreciate this film! 5 Stars\\, a perfect film! ","true":true}
