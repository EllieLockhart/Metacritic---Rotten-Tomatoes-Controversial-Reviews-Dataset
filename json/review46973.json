Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a bunch of garbage. I can't believe Disney allowed this AWFUL director to completely ruin a Star Wars and then reward him by allowing him to write more episodes. It's almost like this idiot never even watched the last one and decided to make hie own Star Wars SJW movie. The Force Awakens was so good and this idiot decided to not even address any of the burning questions from the last one. This movie is a huge letdown and dissapintment. I never want to see anything Rian Johnson ever puts out again. Thanks for ruining Star Wars!","true":true}
