Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The story is such a snoozefest and not only is the tone all over the place\\, but so is the quality of the film. There are so many universe-breaking moments (Such as the Holdo maneuver). Characters reset between Episode 7 and 8\\, and then again within Episode 8. There is no tangible growth. Rey is treated like a god and never given an opportunity to grow as a character which is totally robbing from her the arc that she deserves. This is not even mentioning the total disrespect that this film has for the character of Luke Skywalker. There is no real explanation from his shift from a hopeful man whonsees the good in people to a would-be child-murderer. It's sickening to turn a character people look up to into an awful person\\, but more importantly\\, it's even worse when there is no tangible reason given or evolution (de-evolution) shown.","true":true}
