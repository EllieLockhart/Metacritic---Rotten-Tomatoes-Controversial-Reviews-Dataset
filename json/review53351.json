Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite having so much potential this film squanders in all for the sake of \\\"surprises\\\" which would be good if they were good surprises\\, unfortunately\\, they are not. SPOILERS AHED. They had the most beloved character in all of Star Wars\\, Luke Skywalker who we all wanted to see show of his huge new powers much like we saw Darth Vader in Rouge one\\, but no\\, he's mad for most of the TINY bits of the film that he's in\\, then dies. For no apparent reason\\, it didn't have to kill him but they made that the case. Now we are left with a bunch of characters no one cares about nearly as much\\, all the main ones are either dead or sadly cannot come back\\, even the original lightsaber is now split in half leaving barley anything from the original trilogy coming out of this movie in one piece. This is not a terrible movie but due to the shocking choices in characterisation and the decision to kill off almost all the main characters we care about it deserves no more than 2 stars. It was very easy not to screw up this bad just develop what you started in the last film and don't kill everyone we're interested in\\, for some reason they decided to do just the opposite.","true":true}
