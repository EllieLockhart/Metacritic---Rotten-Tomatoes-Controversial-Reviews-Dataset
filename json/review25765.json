Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a SW movie\\,TOTAL DISRESPECT to Luke Skywalker.  Disrespect to legacy characters and a big FU to the fanbase.  Disney let Kuntleen Kennedy ruin SW\\, Ruin Johnson is not a fan but a fanboy who trashed the legacy he was given with full approval of KK.  How horrible writing\\, cavernous plot holes. bad comedy\\, irrational decisions got made into a movie show the SW storygroup which was originally only women cared more about SjW agenda then the franchise they were entrusted with. Didn't like TFA\\, RO was decent\\, TLJ is just a dumpster fire to the legacy.  SW ended in 2012 when Lucas sold it.  \\nChanged to one star so it counts if it's true 1\/2 stars don't count.","true":true}
