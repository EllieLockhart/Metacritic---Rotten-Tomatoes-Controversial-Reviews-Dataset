Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Spoiler alert\\\" I thought it was a good plot\\, funny small jokes I just was not a fan at how suddenly the Jedi have all new abilities that we have never seen and even leia can even fly and survive in space!","true":true}
