Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looking at the Last Jedi as its own movie makes it on of the best movies of 2017. Put along side the rest of the star wars movies the last Jedi is fresh and a new spin on the star wars world. For the people crying about this movie they need to sit down and watch the movie and stop reading into stuff\\, Its a movie in a made up world get over it. \\n\\nits a must watch movie of 2017","true":true}
