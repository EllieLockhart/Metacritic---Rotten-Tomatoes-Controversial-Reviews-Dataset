Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars period.  Whether you liked The Force Awakens or not\\, The Last Jedi completely destroyed the parts of the storyline that people were actually interested in.  I walked out of this film\\, a 40 year Star Wars fan\\, completely uninterested in what happens next for these characters.  I couldn't be more disappointed and think Rian Johnson made a terrible film.  Poor choices sir.","true":true}
