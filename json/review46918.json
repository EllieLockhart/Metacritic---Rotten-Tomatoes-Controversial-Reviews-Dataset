Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see the first star wars film in '77 as a young kid. Loved star wars ever since until this monstrosity appeared. Does not have the continuation of the current trilogy\\, instead its been violated with pc propaganda and has killed off the characters who we grew up with and loved. This is not star wars.","true":true}
