This game is not perfect by any means\\, but I think this game does significantly more right then it does wrong. Sound design\/music\\, Cinematography\\, UI\\, Accessibility\\, and Gameplay are virtually perfect and a marginal improvement from Naughty Dog's previous game Uncharted 4.\r\rWhere the issues arise are in some questionable bloated flashback sequences and a bold dichotomy between our established main character Ellie\\, and the new 'villian' character Abby. I think this story would have been told much better if it weren't for the excessive use of flashbacks and failure to establish Abby and friends before killing off our previous main character\\, Joel. This would have allowed us as the player to become more shocked with the death of Joel\\, and would cut down on the portion of the game where you take control of Abby in Seattle.\r\rDespite this\\, I think that the broad stroke of a revenge story on the surface being transformed into a story about forgiveness and how our two main characters change over time was executed fairly well. This game has so much intertwining of plot threads that you probably will need to play this a second time to really appreciate what all is happening between the time you play as Ellie in Seattle to when you eventually play as Abby.\r\rThis story isn't nearly as linear and focused as the original\\, but I found myself unable to guess what happens next while playing. Ultimately\\, this resulted in a gripping story that I thoroughly enjoyed for the most part\\, and would recommend playing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
