Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a big disappointment the plot was slow and uninteresting. Laura Derns character was just smug with not justification.  The scene with Princess Leia pulling herself back in side the ship just reminded me if the scene in Guardians of the Galaxy where Peter rescues Gimora.  The whole humor of the movie felt more like guardians than Star Wars.  They really missed the mark with this film.","true":true}
