Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointment is my underlying feeling\\, closely followed by anger. 2 years of build up + waiting\\, even set my alarm on release morning to be able to book as soon as soon as tickets were released + I feel cheated on so many levels. My sister + I are original 70's star wars devotees + we watched it separately + were both left feeling it was a poor knock off of empire strikes back - with none of the class + lots of trashing of true star wars! My sister was angry at the swearing (star wars has never previously featured any) + the whole milking scene + the chewy porg  pet thing angered her when \\\"he rips arms out of their sockets if he looses\\\".  My issues were more the massive trashing of star wars lore... So yoda appears + is the first force ghost to be able to physically interact with the real world - shoot fire at the tree... So why did all past jedi not suddenly appear + attack Kylos army to save the resistance without a rebel life being lost??\\, reys is a nobody who at will can look at a mass of boulders + will them to move + yet luke as an all powerful jedi had to train endlessly with yoda + be struck across the head repeatedly for failure to do it! Leia who has always been sensitive to the force but displayed no real powers\\, can suddenly fly like superman - bravo that woman... If only luke previously did that instead of clinging on for dear life calling out to her in his mind\\, rather than flying himself back to safety. Finally snoke is all powerful + Kylos is a snivelling wreck at his feet\\, snoke can use the force to torture reys who is much stronger in the force than Kylo + yet Kylo in a blink u-turns to kill snoke in such a lazy way it reminded me of the little Britain sketch when Walliams written says \\\"how many words\\, how many pages?... Wee the end\\\". So snoke was pointless\\, less observant than palpatine and really why bother??  But my final grouch is luke...... So really he just goes to his island to die.... He feels all the unbalance in the force + sulks away\\, which is just such a character assassination + betrayal of everything he was. I'm sorry if I truly have become the grinch\\, but in my humble opinion this film belongs in the pit of Sarlacc along with those responsible for its creation. The only positive thing I can say is my kids lived it + the porgs added the cutesy bit for my little girl\\, there was lots of fighting for my son + my hubby who is not a star wars purist thinks I'm a grumpy old lady as he enjoyed it very much. So watch for yourself\\, but if you are a purist of the original films I think you too will be disappointed.  The pit of Sarlacc is too good for it.","true":true}
