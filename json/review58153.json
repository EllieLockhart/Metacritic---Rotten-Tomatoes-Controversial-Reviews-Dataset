Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow.  this movie is really bad.  Did the critics even watch the movie or did the embargo terms include favourable views a must?   Did they show them a different cut of the film?  I cannot believe disney green lit this.  This movie felt like board members directed the film.  This isn't about the fan expectation and all that.  I'm just a casual star wars fan who have an interest only in the movies (I dont know anything about the novels and stuff).  As a movie this really sucked from a story telling point of view.  It was filled with\\, well\\, fillers and pointless public service announcements (casino scene?) that detracted from the main plot - if you even call it a main plot.  No spoilers\\, but 3\/4 of the movie can be deleted and still won't make a difference. The worst is when the people defend it saying that the bad parts were \\\"plot twists\\\" or it's \\\"new direction\\\" - to the dumpster right?   \\ngod the dialogues were jarring to say the least.    Disney gave star wars team practically a blank cheque and this is what they came up with?  This pile of steam will not age well.     for that\\, 1\/2 star.","true":true}
