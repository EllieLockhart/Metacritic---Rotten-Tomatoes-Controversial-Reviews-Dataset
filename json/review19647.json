Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a disappointment and I went in with lower expectations after hearing the initial reviews. There was an extra layer of cheesiness with lines you'd expect more from Jack Sparrow than main Star Wars characters. Just didn't feel authentic to me - like a film trying to find its purpose.","true":true}
