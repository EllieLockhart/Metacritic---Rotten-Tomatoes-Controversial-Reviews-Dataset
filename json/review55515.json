Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals and effects but the story is fragmented and sloppy. It seems like they looked online and decided to do the exact opposite of what the fans predicted\\, even if that wouldn't make sense in the movie. \\nThis is\\, by far\\, the worst star wars movie ever made worse than attack of the clones\\, heck\\, if it wasn't for the effects it would be worse than THE HOLIDAY SPECIAL! \\nRose's character is pointless and obnoxious\\, preaching about \\\"not sacrificing ourselves\\\" right after Holdo did exactly that. \\nRey is more and more a mary sue since now they stated she is just \\\"a girl\\\" and she is not related to anyone. I'm not saying she should have been a Skywalker\\, i would have enjoyed if she was a Bridger or even a Palpatine (that would have been a nice role reversal because a Solo would have been the villain and a Palpatine would have been the hero) and Luke...oh my lord\\, poor Luke. \\nThat's not Luke Skywalker\\, that's Crazy Steve\\, a hobo that found Luke's clothes and started impersonating him. I was never the guy who ranted about things \\\"ruining my childhood\\\" (let's be real\\, if a movie ruins your childhood\\, you had no childhood to begin with) but this movie HURTS and the worst part is that nothing they will do in episode 9 will fix this. The damage is done\\, the mythos is destroyed\\, either they scrap this movie from canon and reshoot it or they won't be able to get out of the corner they painted themselves in.","true":true}
