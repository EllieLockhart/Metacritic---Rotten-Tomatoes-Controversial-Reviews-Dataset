Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We were picking a Star Wars for movie night and my 10 and 8 year old told me the Last Jedi is their least favorite and they don't want to watch it again.  I think its just bad storytelling.","true":true}
