Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Guess what critics - I'm not a 'bot' - and I didn't like this movie. It was enjoyable enough sure - but that was more because of the company I was with when I watched it in the cinema. \\n\\nThe movie itself is a big f' you to Star Wars. \\n\\nThe writing is piss poor - with plot holes galore\\, contrived character interactions\\, and just down right stupid. The world's internal consistency is thrown out the window for easy 'wow' moments - which just come across as ridiculous and disrespectful. \\n\\nAnd if people thought Ray was a Mary Sue in Force Awakens - she's basically a God in this one. \\n\\nAnd the worst thing? I am no longer looking forward to the next Star Wars film - you've done the unthinkable Disney and Kathleen Kennedy - you've killed any  'new hope' we may have had for future Star Wars movies.","true":true}
