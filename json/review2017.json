Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who grew up watchingStar Wars movies and obsessing over the plot\\, I'm never seeing another of these movies. They should've stopped at 6 and prevented Disney and JJ Abrams from ruining these movies forever. The plot was absolutely horrid and random and felt like the ultimate goal was just to surprise Star Wars fans. I'm glad this movie is deservedly getting bad reviews from real Star Wars fans","true":true}
