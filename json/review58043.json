Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why spend $4bn on anything\\, just to dismantle it?  kk's strategy(?) makes no sense and\\, as a result\\, the brand equity is disappearing.\\nThe entire mythos\\, characters\\, and\\, even more recent plot lines are all destroyed by this movie - which is so bad\\, the ill will from ex-SW fans is bleeding into Disney.  Fans (of both genders) wanted Star Wars\\, not feminism and misandry.\\nLucasfilm (kk) has dismissed the atrocious Rotten Tomatoes scores\\, and\\, has mocked the YouTube backlash.  Fans are now left with only their choice to avoid future tickets for this franchise\\, and that's what will happen.  This movie killed a franchise.","true":true}
