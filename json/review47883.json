Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While a watchable movie this installment does everything it can to troll it's fans and destroy everything you love about the previous movies. This is cinematically better than the prequels\\, but managed to accomplish something none of the prequels ever did. I now do not care what happens to the characters. I will probably see episode 9\\, but I'm not going to be waiting with baited breath as I have for every other movie. This movie may well have killed the franchise.","true":true}
