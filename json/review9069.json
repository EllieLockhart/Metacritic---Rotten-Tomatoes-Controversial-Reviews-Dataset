Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of missed opportunities\\, misdirected focus on irrelevant plot loops\\, and an overall disservice to long time fans. I think ratings would be even worse than reflected among hard-core fans. This movie is for people new to star wars\\, many of which might actually enjoy it.","true":true}
