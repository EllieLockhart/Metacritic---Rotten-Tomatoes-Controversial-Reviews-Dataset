Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have read many of the new cannon books that were supposed to support the new trilogy. None of the information or clues given in the books has any relevance to the story of The Last Jedi. A new universe has been created but very few elements are connected. Is this a way for Disney to branch out into many new areas and give us never ending stories? Are we being fed stories for the sake of being fed or are the stories connected in a meaningful way. There are too many gaps between the movies. The only way to get all of the new information is to convert Star Wars into shorter digestible bites like new TV series. Fans love the complex universe but it has to be crafted more consicely.","true":true}
