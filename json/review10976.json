Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having grown up with Star Wars\\, I can say that I am very pleased with \\nwhat steps Rian Johnson took with the storyline.  I have seen it three times to date.  I will admit that after my first show that I was thinking \\\"I can't believe he did that.\\\". My subsequent viewings changed my perspective.  As Master Yoda said\\, \\\"You have to unlearn what you have learned.\\\"  \\n\\nActing was solid on all fronts.  Mark Hamill is at his best. Action sequences are some of the best.   This pushes the story forward and preps us for the final chapter in the Skywalker story line.  I'm looking forward to closing this book and starting new chapters of the galaxy far\\, far away that I've grown up with for the past 40 years.\\n\\nI also find it surprising and frustrating that so many people are bashing this movie.  Many of the accounts where the scores are so low are attached to accounts that no longer exist.  Steer clear of the dark side and give this journey a ride.","true":true}
