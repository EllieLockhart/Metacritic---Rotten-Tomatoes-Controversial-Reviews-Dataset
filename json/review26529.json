Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of things i liked. But the animal rights and vegan crap was hard to swallow. And the belittling of men was disgusting. I like ray and feel if you lose 30 minutes of the film you would gave a great peace. I go to movies to get away not feel like im being lreached a liberal agenda. And for the record im in the middle politically bUt cant stand to be preached too.","true":true}
