Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this movie is just okay. I have only seen it once\\, and in that one showing I must say that I was very disappointed with the majority of the movie. The only thing that really kept the story going was Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, and Luke Skywalker. All of these characters were well developed and layered. Also\\, most of the action sequences were well thought out and choreographed. Other than that\\, the story fell flat because it was too scared to take any risks. One of the biggest reasons as to why this movie wasn\u2019t so good was because it was trying too hard to mimic the MCU. They tried to make pointless jokes\\, and most of the story was focused more on action sequences rather than plot. This left viewers with a shallow story. The Last Jedi is just an average Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
