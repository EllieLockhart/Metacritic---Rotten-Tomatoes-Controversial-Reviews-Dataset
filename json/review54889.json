Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its been a week now since i've seen the movie and i still cannot believe that my favorite movie franchise has been raped so hard!\\nI really dont know where to begin what wrong with the movie.\\nThe story is so weak\\, there is absolutly no character development\\, forced humour\\, forced feminism\\, it is all so\\, so\\, so bad!\\nStar wars can do alot of things wrong but at the end it always gave me a good feeling. \\nBut after this movie i just felt empty\\, asking myself how it is possible to ruin this fantastic franchise. \\nI'm done!
