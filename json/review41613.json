Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is gorgeous. I love the characters and the conflict and visually it's just incredible. Amazingly creative and it sucks that it's getting a low audience rating by angry fanboys who hate change cause this is a damn good film.","true":true}
