Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a low IQ\\, overly snarky Star Wars movie that displays the morality of douchbags!  Terrible movie.  The only good parts are of Ren and Rey interacting.  Rian Johnson should be fired from any further Star Wars involvements.  Other then being a good looking movie I have nothing good to say.  It is horrible from the moments the opening scroll fades into space - all the way through the credits where you see Rian Johnson wrote and directed.  I am serious that this was a huge drop the Star Wars torch by Disney to allow such a terrible movie to be made.  I can only hope that JJ Abrams can somehow salvage this carnage of a story into episode 9 and conclude this.  I know this reads very harshly against it\\, but I sincerely mean all of it.  It is just terrible in the story\\, the priority of screen time for bad side stories\\, the lack of development of main story elements such as the back story of Lukes Jedi Order vs the Finn Captain Plasma rivalry.  Leias new found ridiculous force powers\\, Lukes bad decisions and morality as a Jedi\\, Yoda showing up doing more bad contributions to the story.  All around this movie was just terrible.  Rian Johnson has no talent as a writer or director and how he got the reins for this is a mystery to me.  This movie is worse than the worst of the expanded universe garbage that Disney de-canonized.","true":true}
