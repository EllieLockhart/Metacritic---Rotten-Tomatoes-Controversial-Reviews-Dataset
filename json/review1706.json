{"101487":105355,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a person that didn't like The Force Awakens because of similarities to plot to A New Hope and technicalities such as prop design\\, I had hopes for The Last Jedi to be the thing that would kickstart my love for the Sequel Trilogy. Unfortunately\\, what the movie turned out to be was a collection of side plot and filler for the most part.\\nI could rant for days for what is wrong with the movie\\, but I shall cover what I do like first:\\n1. World design and Music. The world is unique and enjoyable and John Williams music has never failed to impress me.\\n2. The interaction between Kylo and Rey\\, it was unique and I appreciate the attempt as well as uncovering the half-truths\\n3. Rey being born from a nobody. As a guy highly invested in the lore\\, it would pain me greatly if the movie takes the \\\"greatness can only come from greatness\\\" route and have her be a Skywalker\\, Kenobi\\, etc.\\n4. The first part of the scene where the First Order just about barely wipes out the Resistance.\\n5. DJ. His characters are charming and explore the grey area I was expecting the movie to heads towards. More on this later.\\n6. Luke's portrayal as a broken man.\\nNow that I got the basics of what I like out of the way\\, I will try to limit my seemingly endless rant on the basics:\\n1. Humor. Unlike the organic humor that rises out from the situation as with most instances in Star Wars\\, TLJ's humor derives directly from jokes. It is almost as if the line \\\"you speak first? I speak first\\\" quip in TFA was extrapolated into the entire comedy of the film. This makes things obnoxious and ruins the atmosphere of the scene.\\n2. Uncompelling factions. We are supposed to be seeing a classic good vs evil story. Yet the good side is going full dark horse route while the evil side lacks any skill\\, just a loudmouth\\, rhetoric spewing man as their military leadership that can barely muster the presence of the likes of Tarkin and yet again\\, their \\\"gamechanger\\\" weapon gets destroyed within 5 minutes of the movie starting.\\n3. The movie teased the idea that the movie will be taking a new path - which they did\\, I will admit - perhaps into the grey area. I have been a big supporter of the grey area in polarized stories such as this and was thrilled to have DJ introduce the concept of \\\"don't pick a side\\, be free\\\" and Luke and Yoda going on about the follies of the Jedi. And lastly\\, perhaps just Kylo being manipulative\\, but he offered an ability to step away from this polarized point of view. But how did it turned out? All these potential discarded for the traditional good vs evil shtick.\\n4. Collection of subplot and filler is what I call the movie\\, and I feel it's justified. The events with Holdo and the slow chase scene with the Raddus? Filler to pad the runtime. Adventures of Rose and Finn? Feels like a subplot that could be avoided completely as it brought nothing to the main plot except Rose's shoehorned romance with Finn.\\n\\nAnd that is  only the top of the problems I ha with Ep. 8\\, amongst others included Phasma proving to be worthless again\\, the Force now being something someone can master easily\\, and others like it. And with that I give the film a 2.5 out of 5 and is now very worried about Rian Johnson's unrevealed trilogy.","true":true}
