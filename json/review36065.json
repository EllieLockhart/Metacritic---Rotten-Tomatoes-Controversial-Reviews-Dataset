Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi tells an original and compelling yet sometimes overly fast-paced story that dives deeper into the mysteries of the Force. Rian Johnson does an excellent job of developing the characters introduced to us in past Star Wars movies\\, from the knowledge-seeking and optimistic Jedi learner Rey to her disenchanted Jedi master Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
