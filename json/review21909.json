Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just regular... it's a mediocre movie to be honest. I was excited because all I saw was so many good reviews from \\\"reliable\\\" reviewers and I tried to not get spoiled by the internet\\, probably as everyone wanted to watch the movie\\, just to be disappointed in the end\\, bad jokes all over the place\\, tons of unnecessary appearances of some little furry animals to be sold just as merchandise by Disney\\, disappointing development of the story. They had the chance to make a really great story but it turned out just mediocre.","true":true}
