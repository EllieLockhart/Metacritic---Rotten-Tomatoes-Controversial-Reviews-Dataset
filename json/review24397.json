Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Moderately entertaining. \\n\\nAn episodic story that really doesn't seem to go anywhere makes this feel like the longest of the Star Wars movies. A bit like Phantom Menace where Jarjar Binks is replaced with a lot of internal conflict and the gratuitous death of a favorite character.\\n\\nFire the management team and replace them with George Lucas!","true":true}
