Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Those out  there hating on this film is pure insanity... they had an idea in there head of what a movie should be and it didn't follow there plan.. sorry people this movie is INCREDIBLE! Breathtaking and I feel it's the best installment but I see why the \\\"simpleton\\\" Star Wars \\\"fan\\\" may not like it but that's fine\\, some people don't get quality.","true":true}
