Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably the trickiest star wars movie there is. Most critics love it\\, while most fans despise it. In my eyes\\, with no bias or personal feelings\\, this is not a bad movie\\, yet it is severely flawed. I think it is a good addition to the saga and a good movie overall. With bias and personal feelings\\, however\\, I would say this is my favorite star wars movie.","true":true}
