Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly can't understand the hate. This was a great film that challenged expectations and breathed fresh life into the Star Wars franchise. People seem to be forgetting that the trilogy isn't finished yet\\, I saw the same complaints when the Force Awakens came out - 'it didn't answer\/explain...' - there's still one film to go. Wait until the trilogy is finished before complaining about a lack of answers or explanations for something.","true":true}
