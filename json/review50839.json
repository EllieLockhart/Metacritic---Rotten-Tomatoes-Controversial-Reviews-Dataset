Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A blockbuster masterpiece. Rian did with Star Wars what George Miller did with Mad Max Fury Road. Original. He also took our heros and made them dynamic\\, conflicted\\, and capable of mistakes. This added the layer of emotional investment Force Awakens and many other SW films sorely lacked. Last Jedi is second only to Empire for me.","true":true}
