Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A truly emotional\\, exciting and rewarding film. Containing beautiful direction from Rian Johnson\\, clever writing that takes the story into new and interesting directions. It makes some bold choices that is unlike anything else in a Star Wars film\\, but as a life long fan of both the Star Wars saga and cinema as a whole I felt that this was overwhelmingly a triumph in blockbuster filmmaking.","true":true}
