Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A huge disappointment from start to finish. This movie tarnishes the classic series charecters\\, wastes the new series charecters and takes everything that was moderately interesting from the previous movie and just casually throws it away. The plot relies heavily on poor or ridiculous decision making by charecters\\, there are no meaningful or interesting answers to any questions set up in FA and the characterisation of many of both the new and old charecters is hugely flawed. There are a few moments of quality and some strong performances\\, with Adam Driver in particular really shining\\, but this is nowhere near enough to save this movie.","true":true}
