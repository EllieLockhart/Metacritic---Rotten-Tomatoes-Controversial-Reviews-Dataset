Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, f that. F Star Wars. Force Awakens was ok (still I didn't watch it a second time\\, that third death star and the cringy new republic destruction scene killed it)\\, because it offered a lot of semi interesting questions. TLJ failed to answer those\\, but delivered plot holes and cringy story and dialogue in return.","true":true}
