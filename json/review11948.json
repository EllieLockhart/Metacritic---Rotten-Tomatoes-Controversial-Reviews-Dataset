Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HUGE Star Wars fan.....but this movie was TERRIBLE!  Worst scene ever in a Star Wars movie was in this when Princess Lea comes back into the ship.  I couldn't believe it!  So many plot holes\\, predictable\\, no character development\\, not consistent with the Jedi\\, Luke looked like a coward...I still can't believe how bad it was.","true":true}
