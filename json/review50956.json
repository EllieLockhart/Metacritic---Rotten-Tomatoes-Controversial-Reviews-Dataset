Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage.  Love star wars prior to this fIlm. This movie should be deleted from the star waRs franchise. There is no way excePt through blatant Bribery and corruption any critIc couLd possibly give this a positive review. If you love star waRs\\, stay away from this film...it will ruin your star wars Passion.","true":true}
