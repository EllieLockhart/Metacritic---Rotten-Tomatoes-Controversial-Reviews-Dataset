This game does not aim to please fans\\, or cater to what they would have wanted in a story. Instead\\, if stays true to its own rules\\, and world that we were introduce to in the first game. Naughty Dog refrained from creating a cash grab feel good game\\, and instead tells a moving tale about revenge\\, humanity and the consequences of others\\, and your own actions. The game is gripping\\, moving\\, unrelenting\\, and somber\\, and people dislike it for it. Yet that was the tone of the first game. I really don't think anyone could create a real opinion on it unless you play it for yourself\\, or watch someone play through it fully. I won't ramble on about the graphics\\, but the gameplay is very similar to the first game\\, but almost every aspect of it has been improved here. Environments are huge\\, combat scenarios can be tackled in 10-20 different ways. There are some flaws here\\, as no game is perfect. Something that definitely could have been improved in my opinion\\, is the environmental storytelling. To much of it depends on stopping and reading a note\\, and I would have loved some fallout-esque set design. The pacing of the game can also be criticized\\, as the game can feel drawn out at some moments\\, both on the front end of the game\\, and the back end. They could have shaved 4-5 hours off\\, and I feel the the story would have flowed a bit better.All in all\\, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this game. Sure I didn't leave with a massive grin on my face\\, but not every story is ment to invoke that kind of response\\, but that sure as hell doesn't mean it's a bad story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
