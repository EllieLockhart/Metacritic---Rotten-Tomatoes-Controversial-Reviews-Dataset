Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was more like a Star Wars parody than an actual Star Wars movie\\, starting with Poe Dameron's trolling of General Hux. That was a scene I would expect to see in an episode of Robot Chicken. The entire Canto Bight scene was a waste of time. It made no sense and didn't add anything to the story. Major plot-points went unresolved or were resolved in completely unsatisfactory ways such as Snokes origins and Reys parents. Luke Skywalker in this movie didn't behave the way we would expect from a character we know so well and just struck a wrong note in every scene we saw him in up until the grand finale. His death made no sense either. I could go on and on about why I disliked this movie so much. I love Star Wars which is why I am so disappointed in The Last Jedi and will probably not go see Solo in the cinemas. My small way of sending Disney a message that they need course correction here.","true":true}
