Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. There's so many plot holes and random things that make absolutely no sense. Leia actually flies through space. Luke is  not Luke. Rey can do anything with minimal training. I could go on and on but I'm not going to say anything that hasn't been said already. It's terrible.","true":true}
