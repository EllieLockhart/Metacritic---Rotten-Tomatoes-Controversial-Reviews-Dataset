Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After reading the \\\"Top Critics\\\" response I truly believe they are either paid off by movie companies or they are just pandering to what they believe the masses want to think.  This movie was awful from beginning to end.  It offered nothing in STORY from a star wars movie\\, or Any other movie for that matter.  It did not feel like it was set in the same \\\"universe\\\" as preceding movies\\, and might just have been hyped as a reboot.  The acting of all support characters made it feel cheap and From sets to script\\, it offered nothing new.  so wrapped up in politics and out of place jokes was it\\, that it pushed you out of the world of star wars rather than pull you deeper in.  I would not go see the next one if you paid for my ticket...  And I liked Star Wars before this.","true":true}
