Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes a lot of risks and liberties with the Star Wars universe and general acts outlines of movies.\\n\\nIt is understanding it did not play well with some\\, but I respect gambling and taking risks with preconceived notions of how things are supppsed to go. So high marks from me.","true":true}
