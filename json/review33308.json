Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Supurb and Inspired. Expands the mythology of the Star Wars universe in a way which is creative and unafraid to push the franchise forward but in a way which is totally faithful to the spirit of the original trilogy and which even ties together the mythology from the prequels and expanded universe. Raises the level of the entire saga and gives the rest of the franchise a place to continue to grow from.","true":true}
