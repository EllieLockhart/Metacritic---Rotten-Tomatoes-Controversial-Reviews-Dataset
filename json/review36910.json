Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was fantastic. I thought that the writing incorporated humor\\, satire\\, and the emotion very well. I was very pleased with the special effects\\, and all of this scenes that it had so much going on. I feel like I could see the movie over and over again and still pick up the new things that are happening in and around the movie. I will definitely be seeing it more and more and more. ","true":true}
