Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some flaws with this one. I thought the whole casino par could have been avoided altogether and there are aspects of the chase scene that are not very convincing.\\nBut everything related to the Force has been \\\"upgraded\\\" with new concepts and interesting twists. A return of and old-time-favorite character was perfect. The Force is once again mystical and awe-inspiring! Great overall.\\n\\nLike many other movies (Empire included) most audiences hate this one at first. Maybe will like it in a not too distant future. While I'm ok with them not liking it\\, I truly hope that those who display such rage against it won't ever come to a Star Wars theatrical show again: these people tend to ruin the mood with their constant whining. It's really frustrating. You don't like it? That's fine...just please leave us other people alone\\, will ya?","true":true}
