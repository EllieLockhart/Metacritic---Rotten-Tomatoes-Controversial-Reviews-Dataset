Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie wears you down in the beginning.   Restless audience for the better part of the movie.   Picks up speed at the end.  Don't know how they should've improved it.   I began feeling like I was watching a Harry Potter cult movie...appeals to hardcore SW fans but not casual audiences.   3.5 stars.","true":true}
