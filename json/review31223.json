Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes. So many stupid mistakes by characters and the writers. This movie wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2(TM)t just bad\\, it wrote itself into a corner. The story really has nowhere to go from here. If I was JJ having to clean up this train wreck\\, I would be furious with Rian Johnson for the decisions he made and furious with Kathleen Kennedy for allowing him to do it.","true":true}
