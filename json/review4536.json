Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematically beautiful\\, but tied together with unimportant sub-plots that ended up stealing the show. Too many characters to fully develop any emotional connection to any of them. What have they done to the force? It feels like something straight out of the Harry Potter universe.","true":true}
