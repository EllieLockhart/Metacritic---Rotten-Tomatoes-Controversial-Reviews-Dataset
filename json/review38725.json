Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing was horrible.  It's a beautiful movie\\, but the inconsistencies\/plot holes\\, convenient magic writing to move the characters in the direction the storyteller wanted them to go\\, and the horrible treatment of Luke Skywalker\\, was too much to deal with.  There are a number of excellent in depth reviews of this on YouTube\\, with MauLer being one of the most detailed and pointed.  I'm so sad to see my favorite franchise treated this way.  Disney\/Lucasfilm what have you done?","true":true}
