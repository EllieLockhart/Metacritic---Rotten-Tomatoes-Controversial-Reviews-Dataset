We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a slap to the face to the legacy of the first masterpiece. Gameplay is enjoyable. But not much improved from the first game. Some new combat mechanics are there but not any innovation like they claim. Other games have been doing the same thing. Graphics are extremely good. But the horrendous story\\, writing and pacing issues make this game below average for me. This game was all about Joel and Ellie. We wanted to see their relationship grow but they just kill one of the most beloved characters to make way for a character nobody cares about. The game forces you to play as our beloved character\u2019s killer trying to make us sympathize with her. The game spits on the face of the fans. This game would\u2019ve been better if it was a typical revenge story than this pile of garbage. They try to portray 2 of our beloved characters as monsters to make way for a dollar store version of them. Absolutely horrible. The only thing worth it about this game is killing Abby in every way possible and Ellie\u2019s flashback with Joel. Wouldn\u2019t get this game for free. It doesn\u2019t deserve the 10\/10 masterpiece review people are giving this below average game. TLOU was all about the story\\, the gameplay and graphics doesn\u2019t make up for it in the slightest way. Didn\u2019t expect this big of a disappointment as a sequel for one of the greatest games ever. Also\\, for people complaining about the woke agenda\\, I agree with them. I don\u2019t have problem with homosexual characters. In fact\\, I liked Ellie being lesbian. But\\, not in this game where the plot revolves around that it becomes annoying. I don\u2019t like that Ellie being lesbian is only serving the plot whereas in the left behind dlc\\, it showed you Ellie\u2019s backstory with her best friend Riley. Would not recommend at all. The last of us is a standalone game and there is no sequel. Joel and Ellie lived happily after the first. That\u2019s it. The end. The last of us did it\u2019s story so well with so many awesome characters that there was no reason for a garbage sequel like this to exist.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
