Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\"\\nTruer words have never been spoken. The Last Jedi takes the risk and takes the Star Wars story in a new\\, bold\\, and risky direction. It wasn't perfect\\, but damn was it fun. The Porgs were great\\, seeing our princess Carrie Fisher one last time was awesome\\, and big props to Mark Hamill for this new approach to Luke and the Jedi way. Some neat surprises & twists\\, and amazing special effects.","true":true}
