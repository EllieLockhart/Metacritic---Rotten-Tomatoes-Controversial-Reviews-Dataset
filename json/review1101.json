Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unfunny\\, overly long film that seems to take pleasure in perverting the values of established characters and supplanting them with cookie-cutter Disney heroes and villains.    \\n\\nThe Last Jedi takes every interesting thread from The Force Awakens and annihilates it beyond repair.  \\n\\nIf nothing else\\, an impressive exercise on how to destroy a beloved franchise in a single film.  \\n\\nI wish Abrams a sincere good luck.","true":true}
