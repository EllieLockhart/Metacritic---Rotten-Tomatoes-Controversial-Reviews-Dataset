Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a stinging disappointment. \\n\\nThere were no plot developments. No continuity. All previous cliff hangers and mysteries were ignored\\, if not out right contradicted. Constant debilitating jokes riddled the entire film with obnoxious humor. Iconic characters were eternally disgraced with portrayals such as Leia Poppins\\, toilet flushing Admiral Akbar\\, and child murdering Luke. The film refused to develop Rey. We are up to the third movie and Disney still doesn't have a clue as to who Rey is. Due to unrelenting defeats and humiliations by nearly just anyone\\, specially holograms\\, Kylo is the most underwhelming villain in all of the Star Wars sagas. The characters we came to love in TFA were diminished with recklessness tantrums and forced love stories which made little sense. And they introduce a new Jar Jar Binks in the pointless character of Rose.  \\n\\nMany people blame Rian Johnson for this disappointing movie\\, but the blame solely belongs to Kathleen Kennedy and Disney when they approved of this shit of a movie. \\n\\nLet's hope Disney cleans house by firing these losers.","true":true}
