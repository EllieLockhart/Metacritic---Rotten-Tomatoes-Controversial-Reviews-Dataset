Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a fan of the Timothy Zahn books; this movie brings a realistic duality to the depth of the characters. The force is more than moving rocks and no one is either all good or all bad. I was happy to see that old plots and storylines were not remade for an attempt to try something original; that is to say I was extremely happy not to see another death star and that the crutch of an emperor type character (ie Snoke) will not be moving forward. I do wish the \\\"mission\\\" part of the movie in which Finn took part was not as shallow and was more thought out; further Neil deGrasse Tyson should have been asked to help with the ship chase (it was kind of ludicrous).","true":true}
