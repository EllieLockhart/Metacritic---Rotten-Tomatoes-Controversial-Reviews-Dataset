Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do yourself a very large favor...just watch the trailer for this movie over and over for 2.5 hours.  It is seriously better than sitting through this drivel.  This movie was terrible.  All of the best scenes and parts are condensed in the 2 minute promotion.  Save your money and watch that.  You'll be spared the useless SJW propaganda that occupies this so-called Star Wars film.","true":true}
