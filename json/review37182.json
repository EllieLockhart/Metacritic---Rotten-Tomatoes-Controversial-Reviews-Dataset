Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only thing stronger than the Force will be audience reactions to the latest chapter. I never understood the \\\"gushing\\\" reviews of The Force Awakens. I found that entry a tired predictable retread.  This on the other hand was exciting\\, fresh and intense.  The family and I loved it. Everyone will form their own opinions and offer critiques but I for one was so grateful that I didn't see the same archetype characters and see yet another Death Star get blown up.....","true":true}
