Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter garbage. Proving that force awackens wasn't an accident. Again repeating the weird choice to parallel motives from the original thrilogie\\, this time from episode 5\\, without any coherent story between these\\, or reason for that. Even when it doesn't rip of and think of something itself\\, it is confusing at best and insulting to both fans and the general intelligence of its viewers.","true":true}
