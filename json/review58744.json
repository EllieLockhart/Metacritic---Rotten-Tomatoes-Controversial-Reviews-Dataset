Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay is good but it does get a little stale near the end\\, and there isn't much evolution to Naughty Dog's DNA. They are playing it safe when it comes to their palette in \\\"fun factor\\\". I would have loved to have seen more interactions with monsters and an independent day and night cycle. A good multiplayer will make the replaybility go up.\r\rStorywise\\, i think they are trying new things to expand from what you would expect from their usual linear storytelling techniques you'll see in the uncharted and last of us series. But I think for a story with parallels between characters maybe they should have stuck with one plot instead of  adding two. Abby's part ruined the momentum\\, it felt like a filler\\,  took away from Ellie's progression\\, and made the end feel mute\\, but Lev's introduction is great so take the good with the bad.\r\rStill it was an interesting experience\\, and the game deserves to be played. Not a lot of games reach this level of production\\, but it's not a masterpiece.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
