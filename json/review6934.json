Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Early in the movie\\, we hear Luke Skywalker say \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\,\\\" and if I had to use one word to sum up the movie\\, I would go with \\\"unexpected.\\\" I recently finished watching the animated Clone Wars and Episode III\\, and as much as I loved last year's Rogue One\\, it is refreshing to have a new movie that propels the story forward in unexpected ways. This is a movie that's as much about darkness as it is about hope\\, and as the middle part of a trilogy\\, it should be expected that not everything works outIn the end\\, there is sorrow\\, but also hope that not all is lost.","true":true}
