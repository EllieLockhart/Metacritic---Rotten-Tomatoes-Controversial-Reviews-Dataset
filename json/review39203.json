Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film certainly struck a nerve. Just look at all the 5 and 1 star reviews. Most of them just regurgitate nonsense. This is why no one takes the RT audience score seriously. It's too easy to manipulate.. When you look at other scores you see the divide is much less. It's just a very angry minority upset over a film. Which is bizarre because The Last Jedi is fun. To each their own I guess.... Although there's better ways to deal with it.","true":true}
