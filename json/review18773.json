Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a great movie and really gets on the edge of your seat at some points. The Snoke's throne room scene is incredible and has one of the best lightsaber fights ever in my opinion. The battle of Crait was also awesome. And the beggining scene with Poe really got me excited to see the rest of the movie.","true":true}
