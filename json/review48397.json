Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With an overall theme of letting go of the past\\, the irony is that with The Last Jedi\\, it looks like time for adult fans to let go of Star Wars. It is no longer the imagination engine it was in our childhoods where the stories of Luke\\, Leah\\, Han and Chewie were whatever we wanted them to be. They're all gone. The well is dry. Let the kids have these new guys flying X-wings and fighting Apple brand Stormtroopers. It ain't for us anymore.","true":true}
