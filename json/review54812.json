Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a very original take on the franchise with plenty of  stunning action\\, emotional twists\\, and unexpected plot lines. Ignore the negative reviewers who will nitpick every little detail about the film. Johnson is clearly a passionate filmmaker who took alot of risks and gave us a very satisfying experience that is totally worth the price of admission. 5 stars\\, and I am someone who made it to the theater for the original trilogy.","true":true}
