Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written.  Terrible continuity.  Bad dialogue.  A complete missed opportunity.  I can't believe there was a plot plan in place\\, or at least followed\\, before Episode 7 was written.  I watched a 2+ hour chase scene with a thin plot with no depth and almost no character development.  So disappointing.  I had high hopes after seeing Rogue One.","true":true}
