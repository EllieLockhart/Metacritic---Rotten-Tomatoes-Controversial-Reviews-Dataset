Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What made Star Wars special?  I think beyond the revolution in special effects\\, it was the grand scale of struggle\\, of good vs evil\\, of light vs dark\\, of the galaxy at war\\, of the hero journey that Luke went through and the iconic characters that surrounded him.  \\n\\nIf you're the type that thinks that just because something was something at one point\\, that it doesn't have to be that same thing in the future--maybe that it even shouldn't be the same--and you applaud efforts to break the mold just for its own sake\\, then you'll probably love this movie.\\n\\nIf on the other hand\\, you loved the originals\\, love the hero journey\\, and feel that breaking the mold of something so well defined--yet with so much room for creativity within that mold--is pointless and wrong\\, then you'll hate this movie.  You'll also hate it if you value relevant character development\\, exciting plots\\, and originality.  Ironically\\, when directors and screenwriters try so hard to break the mold to be original to come up with something new in that way\\, they actually end up making it into something else that we've already seen a dozen times.  In one way they succeeded in bringing something new to the Star Wars universe: blandness.\\n\\nSPOILERS REVIEW AND AN ORIGINAL IDEA\\nEverything about this was underwhelming\\, and it felt like that's actually what they were going for.  Rey has no special parents.  Luke is just a hopeless burnout.  The entire movie is one ship running away very slowly from six other ships\\, and how to save that one ship.  (That's Star Trek\\, not Star Wars.)  All the other characters aside from Rey are expendable\\, and yet they kill off the characters that might have made it uniquely Star Wars.  Kill Snoke\\, with no explanation as to who he was or where he came from.  Kill off Luke\\, for no reason except to get rid of the old generation of characters.  (If they wanted to do something truly unexpected\\, they would have kept him alive.)  \\n\\nHere's an original idea and where I thought they might have gone from the previews:\\nLuke thinks the Jedi order must die.  He has come to this\\, not solely out of despondency\\, but because of a realization about the Force through the long lost Jedi texts he found\\, that there is always balance.  That Light must have its counter\\, Dark\\, and so if a Jedi pops up somewhere\\, a Sith must always follow.  It is inevitable.  And so it all needs to end--both the Sith and the Jedi.\\n\\nThis would be interesting\\, because it would fit the story arc with Anakin being the one who was to bring \\\"balance to the Force\\,\\\" which maybe everyone misinterpreted as simply a Jedi victory.  Maybe Luke is torn between wanting to fight and train Rey and just end it all--end both the Jedi and the Sith once and for all.  That would've been epic and cool and different\\, and it would have built multiple layers of conflict into the story and a new take on the Force.  Instead\\, they wanted to redefine Star Wars into something pedestrian.  Critics will applaud that as courageous\\, but I just think it was just easy.","true":true}
