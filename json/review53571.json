Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect but a good popcorn scifi movie. Kylo Ren is portrayed better here than in the previous film\\, and.the addition of bew.characters was done well. The reveal of Rey's parents is probably a misdirect and should be improved in the next installment.","true":true}
