Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Between the awkward attempts at humour and meandering B plots that split up all of the main characters\\, this movie was simultaneously cringe inducing and boring.\\nThe A plot was literally the opening scene of 'A New Hope' drawn out to last for 2 and a half hours.\\nThis movie somehow managed to make me like the newly introduced characters less\\, and also the original trilogy characters as well. The first Star Wars film that I just haven't been able to sit through since my initial cinema viewings. It didn't really leave them with anywhere to go. I feel bad for JJ having to pick up the pieces and resolve the story\\, and also feel bad for George Lucas for being betrayed by Disney.","true":true}
