Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why isn't anything set up in TFA further developed in this movie? The Knights of Ren\\, Rey's connection to Luke's lightsaber\\, Snoke? I don't understand. Why is Rey fighting trained guards like a master saber duelist? Where did she learn to fight like that? This movie makes little sense.","true":true}
