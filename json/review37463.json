Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many negative things I could say about this movie. 2\/3 of The Last Jedi is wasted on boring and unnecessary sub plots. The plot is contrived and does not flow at all. The whole movie seemed like a poke in the eye to anyone who has ever liked Star Wars. I understand not wanting to rehash old plots and tropes but Rian Johnson was actively determined to destroy everything \u201cStar Wars\u201d in this movie. I don\u2019t see how the main storyline can recover from this. For the first time in my life I walked out of a Star Wars movie not even caring what happens next. Rian Johnson has left us with nothing to look forward to. The Force Awakens and Rogue One were absolute masterpieces compared to this film. It was lazily written and poorly executed. There were a handful of redeeming scenes but they did not add up to a good movie. This was really bad; as in \u2018prequel bad\u2019. I hated 2\/3 of this movie. I don\u2019t know how Disney could let Johnson destroy their franchise like this. I left the theater shocked and disappointed.","true":true}
