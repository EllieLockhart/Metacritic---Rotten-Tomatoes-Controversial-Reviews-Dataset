Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total BETRAYAL of the Star Wars canon!  The Skywalker story is the basis of our entrance into this Universe.  To deny and repudiate that mythos is unpardonable!  There was no overarching  need to re-invent the franchise.  Mediocre minds were given the keys to the kingdom and have vomited out a warped and twisted vision of a classic saga now bereft of all he magic it once possessed.   The schoolyard bully has just kicked everyone in the nards and told us it was wonderful .","true":true}
