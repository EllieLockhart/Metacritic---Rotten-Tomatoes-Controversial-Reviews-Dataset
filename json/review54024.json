{"101487":129973,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe all of the backlash for this movie on this site.  I thought this was the one of the best Star Wars movies\\, if not\\, \\\"the best\\\".  The acting was superb and the movie aesthetics were incredible.  The plot\\, along with all of the sub-plots\\, made the climax and the ending of this movie epic!  And sot since Empire Strikes and Return of the Jedi have we seen a Star Wars movie with some great and intense emotions in it.  Finally\\, we have Star Wars actors that can produce real tears in \\\"convincing\\\" emotional scenes.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are great actors that portray their characters beautifully with deep and convincing emotions.  This saga really centers on them two and I think it is fantastic.  Their scenes together are some of the best in all of Star Wars\\, and that climatic sequence towards the end in Snoke's chambers was amazing - never before has that happened in Star Wars before\\, making it just unbelievable.  And how the movie ended with Luke was fantastic as well.  **SPOILERS AHEAD**  Luke projected himself on a remote planet (Crait\\, which by the way is the best planet ever created in Star Wars) to confront the Kylo Ren because he was doing what Yoda taught him in Empire Strikes Back\\, and that is \\\"a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense\\, never for attack.\\\" I'd say Luke did that against Kylo Ren better than any Jedi in all of Star Wars! The only other Jedi that ever came close to fighting the enemy in that fashion was when old Ben Kenobi fought Vader in a New Hope...and he became one with the force after too! You also have Rose saying to Finn a few sequences before the Luke and Kylo scene that \\\"we will win by not fighting with hate but saving with love\\\". Luke didn't fight Ben Solo with hate (at all actually)\\, so maybe that is Luke's first step in trying to save Ben's soul...maybe Luke's Force Ghost connects with Ben Solo on a spiritual level in Episode 9 to help turn him back to the Light Side?  Episode 8 was a great second act in what has been a great new Star Wars trilogy so far.  Episode 9 is shaping up to be the most epic Star Wars yet with everything dependent on what happens between Rey and Ben Solo!  How someone can watch The Last Jedi\\, and not \\\"like it\\\"\\, is mind boggling.  Even if die hard Star Wars fans don't like Luke's character and\/or how the Force was used\\, the film still deserves at least a 3 out of 5 stars for great acting\\, movie aesthetics\\, character development\\, creativity\\, intriguing story\\, and fantastic emotional and action sequences!","true":true}
