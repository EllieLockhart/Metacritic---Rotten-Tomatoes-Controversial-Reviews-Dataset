Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is nothing like people are saying. It isn\u2019t bad or terrible and I didn\u2019t leave dissatisfied. I wouldn\u2019t give it five stars but the ratings from users is so low I want to give it a boost. ","true":true}
