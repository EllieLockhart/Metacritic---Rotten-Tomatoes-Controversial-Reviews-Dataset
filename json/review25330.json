Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No\\, I'm not a trump kin\\, rabid fan\\, bigoted or w\/e. I am a liberal leaning dude\\, have no problem with well written meaningful women lead or characters; I love mad max\\, alien\\, original Star Wars\\, etc etc. This movie blows\\, the political agenda and forced diversity ruined it\\, and the circlejerking critics' responses shaming every criticism and name calling people like me is just galling. The plot is atrocious\\, the characters are caricatures\\, and why the fuck is rose butt ugly and chubby when Rey is so attractive\\, how is that helping asians and black people when their characters on screen are so...shit. No more Star Wars for me. Goodbye Luke Skywalker\\, Han Solo\\, goodbye Leia\\, goodbye Chewbacca.","true":true}
