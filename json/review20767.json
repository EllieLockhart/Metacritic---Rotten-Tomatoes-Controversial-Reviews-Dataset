Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this film\\, but from an emotional level\\, I couldn't care less about the characters or what was going on.  Right from the get-go\\, it seemed like the director Rian Johnson had no clue what he was doing and that the script was written over a weekend and rushed into production.  Entire storyplots are made inconsequential by the story itself as it goes along.  It's as if Rian Johnson wrote the movie\\, and no one decided to look at the script\\, challenge his decisions\\, and see if any logic could be applied to make the story stronger.  The only plot I seemed to care about was the Rey\/Luke\/Kylo Ren subplot\\, but even that falls on its face when you really think about the motivations of Luke and how Rian Johnson writes Luke to be totally backwards to what he was in the originals and all the things he learned during the Heroes Journey he went on.  Is it too hard to ask for a star wars film to be taken seriously and to have a script and story written that takes itself seriously as well?","true":true}
