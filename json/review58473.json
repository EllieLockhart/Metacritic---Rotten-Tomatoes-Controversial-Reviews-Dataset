Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of fans are taking this movie *very* personally.  I am an OG Star Wars fan.  I absolutely loved the movie.  If you are at all interested\\, see it.  If you saw it and were thrown off by it\\, see it again!  And no\\, I don't work for Disney.\\n\\nThis movie was supposed to be shocking and unexpected.  I think we can all agree that is the case.  I loved what I saw.  A lot of people didn't.  But our childhoods are intact.  Every Star Wars movie still exists unchanged.  Come to think of it\\, all the old extended universe books still exist as well.  If you want\\, read them.  And I can totally respect that fans have a different reaction to The Force Awakens.  But\\, for me\\, Yoda\\, Luke and I are laughing at the burning tree.  \\n\\nI invite anyone with an open mind to do so to see The Last Jedi again.  I liked it *much* better the second time I saw it.","true":true}
