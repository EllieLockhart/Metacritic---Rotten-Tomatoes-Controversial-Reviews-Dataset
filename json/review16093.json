Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a Star Wars fan from the original 1977 era. I enjoyed listening to all the speculation post Force Awakens\\, but prior to the movie but I went in with an open mind\\, not a list of \\\"must haves\\\". Unlike Potter or LOTR\\, where we tick off the list of scenes we must have\\, this story can and does go to places we have never seen before.  I've seen it twice and whilst the movie is not perfect it provides us something old\\, something new and something very amazing.  I came away happy and looking forward to the next installment.  Well worth seeing.","true":true}
