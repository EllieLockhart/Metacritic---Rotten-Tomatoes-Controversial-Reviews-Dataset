Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im a huge star wars fan. i play the games watch the movies and read the books.This movie ruined star wars so bad it can not be saved. They need to retract  this movie and do it again to get their fan base back. I can pick apart every scene in this movie and tell you why it's bad. I most likely wont watch the next one. I could make a better star wars movie in 15 min. Disney needs to hire a super fan on youtube and let them help write the movies. Then they could sit back and watch the money flow in. They make better star wars theories in 1 week. So if you want to watch star wars turn to youtube.","true":true}
