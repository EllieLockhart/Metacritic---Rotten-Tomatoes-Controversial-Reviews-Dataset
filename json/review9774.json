Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"GO SEE IT! Fun movie\\, great characters\\, cool story..I really appreciate the effort and respect that this new take has given to the original trilogy.. I am going to give this new direction my support and I look forward to next part of the story... by the film's end credits my cheeks hurt from smiling.","true":true}
