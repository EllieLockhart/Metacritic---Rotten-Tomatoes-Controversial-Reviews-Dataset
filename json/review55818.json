Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Positive: looks very good\\, alltough watching it in 3D is not recommendable. Some interesting vehicle designs\\, although nothing really new. The fact that the story continues. Music is not bad.\\nNegative: TLJ openly attacks the very soul of Star Wars. Plot holes\\, irrational plots\\, unnecessary side plots. far to many 'gotcha' jokes on expense of fans and the Star Wars universe itself (feels kind of insulting)\\, also in general too many jokes. Star Wars is not comedy. It has to much of recent superhero movies in it. \\nAll in all: nice action movie you could watch once or twice and then forget\\, but it is not Star Wars. \\nFor further\/detailed information on why TLJ is horrible\\, just go to youtube. Many \\\"fanatics\\\" \\\"fanboys\\\" \\\"not true fans\\\" (i like to call them hardcore fans) made videos about all the mistakes of this episode. It is very frustrating and for some even \\\"heartbreaking\\\". Of course it is not an easy task to make an episode for a legacy that is as huge as in this case\\, but so many stupid mistakes... most fan films are better thought through. Honestly\\, even without being too familiar with the franchise\\, it should be easy to see the plotholes\\, what makes me really wonder about the 90% rating.","true":true}
