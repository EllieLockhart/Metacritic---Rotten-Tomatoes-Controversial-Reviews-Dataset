Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An enjoyable movie? Yes for the most part. There were plenty of amazing action scenes\\, great laughs and touching moments. However I left the theatre with a major feeling of disappointment. \\n\\nMassive bait and switch over many things\\, most I expected after the many obviously misleading edits in the trailers. The biggest disappointment was this was not the Luke Skywalker I believed he would become\\, Disney & Co cheated us out of the real Luke. \\n\\nToo much of this film was super contrived\\, making no sense after the actions of the major characters in the Force Awakens. All made to get the movie from point A to point B with no logic or fluidity in how things were played out. It was almost like they were copying TWD & GOT throwing in twists and shocking moments just to cash in.\\n\\nExpected so much better after how much I loved episode VII. Totally feel cheated out of what should have been an epic sequel and return of one of my all time favourite heroes.","true":true}
