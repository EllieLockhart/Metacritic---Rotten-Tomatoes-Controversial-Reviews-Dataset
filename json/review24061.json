Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Marvel-style humour issues aside\\, this film is super entertaining\\, smart and character driven. Star Wars must evolve in order to keep thrilling fans and delivering quality stories. Rian Johnson gives us an innovative and very promising story which will allow the universe to flourish in new and exciting ways. \\n\\nI was not a die-hard fan of the original trilogy\\, but with the Force Awakens I felt totally swept up and invested in the characters and their universe. Because I was happy to consider this story on its own merits\\, and was not all that concerned about how it would tie in or not tie in with previous films\\, I allowed myself to get lost in this story. \\n\\nI hope Disney continue with this kind of storytelling\\, it's gaining a whole new generation of fans for Star Wars and\\, if it's going to stay relevant\\, that's exactly what needs to happen.","true":true}
