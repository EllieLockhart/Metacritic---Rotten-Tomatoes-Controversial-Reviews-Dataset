Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think i went in to this movie a little better prepared than the casual fan. I have read every new canon novel and all comic book arcs...especially important are \\\"Leia: Princess of Alderaan\\\" and \\\"Bloodline\\\" as well as the Poe Daemeron comic series. I really enjoyed the humour that some are complaining about and the big moments are ground-shaking and change the Star Wars mythos forever. I respect Rian Johnson's willingness to take risks with the property and this fact alone puts \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" above \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" for me. I need to see it again ASAP but really\\, REALLY enjoyed the first viewing.","true":true}
