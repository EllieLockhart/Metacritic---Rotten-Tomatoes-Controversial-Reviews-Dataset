Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost as bad as the phantom menace\\, the whole film was rushed\\, the acting and dialog is stale the comedy was awkward and wrongly timed and the plots where overdone and reused.","true":true}
