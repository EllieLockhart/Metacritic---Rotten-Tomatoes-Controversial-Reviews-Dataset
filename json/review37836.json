Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were some good scenes but the first two hours of the movie is pointless and boring story script. Watch it if your a big fan and all\\, but the truth is is that this movie is just too Disney this time. There were some plot holes and questions from The Force Awakens were answered stupidly. And most of all\\, HOW DARE YOU DISNEY FOR NOT GIVING LUKE HIS ICONIC GREEN LIGHTSABER BACK!!!","true":true}
