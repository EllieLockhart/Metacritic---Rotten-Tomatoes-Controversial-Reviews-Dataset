Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this movie\\, it ruined so much of the star wars lore and canon and especially ruined the main character that I fell in love with. This movie had funny moments thats the star the rest was garbage\\, just sadness.","true":true}
