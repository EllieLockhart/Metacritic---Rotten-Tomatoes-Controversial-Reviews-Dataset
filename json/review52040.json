Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After one of the greatest Star Wars movies (Rogue One)\\, Disney and the new leadership of LucasFilm (Looking at you\\, Kathleen Kennedy) proves that they have no idea on what do to with Star Wars.\\n\\nEpisode VIII doesn't move the plot forward\\, does not answer any questions\\, and destroys everything in the Star Wars mythology.\\n\\nIt's hear breaking to think this is the end of Star Wars that we all  know and love.
