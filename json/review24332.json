Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Milking a franchise here. Humour was awful apart from one scene. Film was too long and attempts at repeating iconic scenes\/lines from the previous films where just cringe worthy. Don't even bother watching the film let alone buying it","true":true}
