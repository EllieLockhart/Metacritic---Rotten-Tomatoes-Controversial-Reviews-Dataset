Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly not really five stars\\, just trying to counterbalance everybody kicking and screaming because the movie didn't do what they wanted. Would having Snoke turn out to be Darth Plagueis or some other apocryphal character have been cool? Sure\\, but not doing that isn't some grand betrayal of the fans or the franchise\\, and the same thing goes for Rey's backstory. The movie is entertaining\\, moves the story forward\\, and unlike the prequels doesn't directly contradict anything in any of the preceding films.","true":true}
