Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a technically good movie\\, maybe the best Star Wars movie production-wise\\, in my opinion\\, but the memories I have of this movie are mostly in the realm of \\\"God\\, I still can't believe that happened\\\"\\, not really in a good way. I do appreciate the gambling with the story\\, but I don't think Star Wars is the place to do it. The plots other than the main plot did absolutely nothing for me and I found uninteresting\\, and although I know Star Wars is not a very grounded fantasy series\\, it still took me out of the story to see Leia suddenly using Jedi unseen powers\\, and Luke as well. I had much hope in Luke as a bitter old man\\, I liked it as a twist at the beginning\\, but it feels like the movie did nothing with it\\, like the whole Jedi order meant nothing the whole time. It was a good movie\\, but\\, in my opinion\\, a very bad Star Wars movie\\, that took me out of the plot so much and so many times\\, that it did nothing emotionally for me\\, and that's what I watch movies for.","true":true}
