Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will admit that I'm not an avid Star Wars fan; however\\, this is the first movie in which I followed the plot the whole way through and my mind didn't wander as I watched. But\\, as I've said before and will say again\\, these movies would be nothing if not for John Williams' music.","true":true}
