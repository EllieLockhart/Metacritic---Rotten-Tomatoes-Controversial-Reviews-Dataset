Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a good movie\\, better than TFA\\, but still it is just that\\, it has too many mistakes\\, they wasted Luke\\, it is the worst case scenario for an old Luke Skywalker. It copies most of its story from ESB with some of ROTJ\\, it has plain story\\, with too many jokes. Sadly it destroys what could have been a master piece. Its not a movie for fans of the saga. If you are not a fan the movie is gonna be great.","true":true}
