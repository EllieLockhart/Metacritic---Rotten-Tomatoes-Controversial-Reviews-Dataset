Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out and was immediately at odds. I tried very hard to like it\\, but was very conflicted. Space battles look epic as you'd expect. Kylo Ren is becoming one of the great villains but some random scenes and limiting the movie to a little slow motion chase scene.... not my favourite Star Wars movie but I applaud the filmmakers on trying something different instead of rehashing what's been done. Not sure where the next one leads but I hope it makes the decisions  employed in this movie make a bit more sense.","true":true}
