Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"seen it gave it an A upon exit. But dont put too much stock in ratings. Go see it. Its an amazing movie and you shouldnt let bots and haters keep you from watching a great chapter. Haters didnt like TFA because they said it was a rehash. Now the same tiny group is trying to make a bigger impact because this movie is too different? Yeah\\, stupid is as stupid does. Just go see the movie!","true":true}
