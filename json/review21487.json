Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would rank this worse than The Force Awakens but Rotten Tomatoes don't have negative stars.  All the problems from TFA is multiplied ten fold.  Its 3 plots feel stupid\\, drawn out scenes that cant build suspense.  \\\"How\/Why did that happen\\\" and \\\"did anyone watch the earlier movies\\\" was my refrain\\n\\nThe Phantom Menace I feel had better special effects overall and better pacing\\n\\nHas one decent fight scene","true":true}
