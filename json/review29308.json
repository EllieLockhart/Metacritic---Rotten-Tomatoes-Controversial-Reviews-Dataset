Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian has ruined my childhood. Worst movie director of the century. He should be working as a night janitor. Movie making is clearly not his field. Also ray is mary sue. Worst character on movie history. Disney should learn how to make good movies from Marvel. Going to avoid disney star wars from now on. For me star wars saga finished with return of the jedi.","true":true}
