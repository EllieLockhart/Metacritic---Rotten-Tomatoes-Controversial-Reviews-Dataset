Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's an ok movie. I found the final act of the movie had some incredible action and was very entertaining. There are some problems with pacing the first half of the movie was pretty boaring and some of the sub plots feel completely pointless. Some of the humour didn't really work and I am pretty disappointed with the way some of the questions from the previous film were answered. Not my favrourite Star Wars movie but it is an ok film. Hope the next one is better.","true":true}
