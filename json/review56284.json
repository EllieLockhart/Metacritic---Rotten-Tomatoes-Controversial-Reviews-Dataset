Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars - The Last Jedi was amazing. If you go in with an open mind and don't get up with fan theories and the expanded universe stories\\, you'll enjoy it.\\n\\nI've been a fan since 1977. I have seeen all movies and tv shows related to Star Wars....even the strange Star Wars Christmas special. Even though I've read all the comics and expanded universe\\, I think that nothing could have topped this movie.\\n\\nThe movie took me back to when I first saw Star Wars the first time. It wasn't called New Hope back then and we weren't sure it would even continue as a series even though George Lucas hoped it would.\\n\\nWith The Last Jedi\\, whatever preconceived notions you have\\, leave them at the door and just enjoy the move. Moments with Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were awesome. The characters they play are getting older and a lot of time has passed since the original trilogy. A lot of complaints have been about their new force powers even though over 37 years have passed. \\n\\nThis movie opens up the Star Wars series to a new beiginning.....a new spark that will keep it going. \\n\\nIt might not be some people's taste\\, but it definitely does not deserve the 1\/2 stars that som fan boys\/girls are giving it. If you don't like it\\, move on and just watch th movies you liked.\\n\\nI'm into Star Wars for the long run.\\n\\nMay the force be with you.","true":true}
