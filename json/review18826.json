Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a mess. The Star Wars should have ended with the 6th episode\\, and it doesn't help that the movie itself is filled with boring characters\\, bad jokes and even more stupid villains. I'm all in for the EU and so on but this is simply terrible.","true":true}
