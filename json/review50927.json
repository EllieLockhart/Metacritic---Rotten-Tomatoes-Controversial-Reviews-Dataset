Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute dumpster fire.  Poor editing with botched action scenes.  Ham fisted political messages shoved down your throat\\, such as cruelty to animals\\, toxic feminism\\, and war profiteering.  Every lesson the characters learn\\, are immediately dropped in the 3rd act.  Cringe jokes like \\\"Please put a shirt on.\\\"  Characters we've known all of our lives betraying us and themselves to satisfy a terrible director's ego\\, so he can claim \\\"Look I killed Star Wars!\\\"  Leia flying like Mary Poppins is unforgivable.  Luke dying from meditating is unforgivable.  Fuck this movie\\, and fuck Rian Johnson! .5 stars","true":true}
