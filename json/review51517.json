Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete mediocre movie that destroys the story that George Lucas created by completely disregarding everything stated from episode 1 to episode 6 without any meaningful (and logical) explanation. The characters are poorly writen and the plot is just confusing.","true":true}
