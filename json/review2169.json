Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible film\\, and a horrendous Star Wars instalment. Poorly written plot\\, poorly written characters (I feel sorry for Mark Hamill) \\\"That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate\\, saving what we love\\\"... even the one-liners are awful. I blame Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy\\, and to the Star Wars fans who make excuses for this movie\\, shame on you!","true":true}
