Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"5 females\\, all better\\, bigger\\, and stronger than Luke Skywalker. \\n30 minute subplot of the characters getting a \\\"parking ticket\\\" that leads them  to \\\"stick it to the rich white man\\\" while saving all the animals. \\n\\nAbsolutely ridiculous film.","true":true}
