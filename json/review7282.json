Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Epic. Exceeded my high expectations.  Mark Hamill was excellent.  Adam Driver was phenomenal as was Daisy Ridley.  It didn't feel long to me.  Nothing felt like a surprise or was disappointing\\, it just felt natural.  Great work by the filmmakers IMHO.","true":true}
