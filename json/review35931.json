Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is very entertaining with great effects and surprises to wow the audience.  It draws heavily from its predecessors in terms of parallelism and symbolism while still standing on its own legs as a part of the franchise.  There is a fair share of closure and new questions that come with this middle movie in the sequel trilogy.  It left me excited for Star Wars 9.","true":true}
