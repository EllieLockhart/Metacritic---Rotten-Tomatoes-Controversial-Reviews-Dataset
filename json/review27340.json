Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Opened an account to post this rating because the movie is that bad.  Lots of other folks go into great detail on why\\, but the plot is garbage and ruins so much of the original three films.  Really disappointing.","true":true}
