Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first words of TFA were\\, \\\"This will begin to set things right.\\\" I only wish that TLJ had tried to live up to that promise. Until last night I had never seen a Star Wars movie that I didn't like\\, and yes\\, I'm including the made for tv Ewok movies from the 80's.  But TLJ has succeeded in putting a bad taste in my mouth. It was so bad I couldn't sleep after watching it. Rian Johnson took maybe the most iconic character in movie history and destroyed him. I can't comprehend what he was thinking with this script or how Lucasfilm or Disney green lit it. At this point I don't know if I want to see more of this trilogy. Thanks for breaking the franchise guys.","true":true}
