Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie broke my heart. This clearly showed me that Disney is more concerned with making a few political statements\\, and mindlessly empowering women in a franchise that already has strong female leads\\, than lovingly crafting a good movie worthy of the title Star Wars. If anyone is reading this\\, then save your money. Don't give this garbage the benefit of a viewing. As far as I'm concerned\\, the new Disney Canon has no rightful place to exist if this is the way they're going to treat this once great franchise.","true":true}
