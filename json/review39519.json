Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film turned Luke into a titty-milk guzzling coward and I will never be able to look at his character the same way again. This film literally shits all over the continuity of previously developed plot and characters.","true":true}
