Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The Last Jedi was fantastic\\, however it was not perfect. It has its flaws but fundamentally it is a great movie. In my opinion\\, this is the best star wars movie since empire strikes back.","true":true}
