Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a real treat. Never been the biggest of Star Wars fans\\, but I enjoyed this one and I feel like it expands upon the story established in Force Awakens even more so. The character of Ben Solo is fleshed out as well as Rey and their whole light - dark duality seems fantastic. The late Carrie Fisher was phenomenal in her role and just glad to see her. The cinematography in some scenes was breath taking. I found it disappointing how Snokes was not explained at all and cast aside but that's rather minor. The theme of failure being a great teacher hit really home. Aside from the aforementioned Snokes issues and sometimes some scenes dragging on too long it was an enjoyable ride.","true":true}
