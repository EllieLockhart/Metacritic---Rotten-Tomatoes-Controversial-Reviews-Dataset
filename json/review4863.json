Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"congrats to Rian Johnson for the worst Star Wars film of all time.  I'm really disappointed with Luke's character and the lack of character development.  I gave ti 2 stars as there was some good action packed scenes.","true":true}
