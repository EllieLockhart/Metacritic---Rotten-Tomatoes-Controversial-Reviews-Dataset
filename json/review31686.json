Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry\\, just can't get behind this movie. It's not as awhile as 1\\,2\\,3 but it fails to take any risks tread any new ground or even get the characters to anything remotely interesting. The Luke\/Snoke plot lines completely fail to satisfy and Finn\/Phasma are basically irrelevent. I forgave The Force Awakens for a lot of these failings as it seemed to be setting the stage for interesting long running story threads. This installment summarily dispatches most of the intersting things that TFA set up and thus makes that movie worse since we are now given an unsatisfying payoff. Where is the character development? To me this just felt like a generic star wars action movie\\, with a bunch of obvious tie ins to star wars expanded universe material that had little to do with making this a better move.","true":true}
