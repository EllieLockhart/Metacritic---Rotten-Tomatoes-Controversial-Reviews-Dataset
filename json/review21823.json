Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just great - having watched every Star Wars movie since the first - The Last Jedi did not disappoint! I know the story line\\, the recycled scenes and characters - but heck\\, that' s why I keep going back.\\n\\nIt has become a family\\, December tradition\\, with our 20 year old son! Star Wars and dinner...be there\\, be square!","true":true}
