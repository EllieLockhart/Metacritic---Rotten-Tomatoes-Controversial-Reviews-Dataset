Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For decades\\, Star Wars has been bigger than its 3\\, then 6 films.\\n\\nIn comics\\, video games\\, books\\, and cartoons it's universe exploded outward in every aspect.\\nThe films have always allowed you to ignore all that. Much like the Marvel Cinematic Universe\\, if it didn't happen in a movie you could ignore it and enjoy the main product without it.\\n\\nBut what you were experiencing was a watered down version of what this universe is.\\n\\nThis movie adds more concentrate. It delves into the details of the WAR\\, and that it's always relied on more than just a handful of special champions. It expands upon the technology\\, and that there's more than just blasters and light swords and ships they go fast or slow.\\n\\nMost importantly\\, it emphatically BLOOMS the force. In film\\, you've seen people use the force to see\\, feel\\, move things around\\, and become ghost after they die.\\n\\nAs a comics reader? I've seen a single Sit Lord crash land in front of a full enemy army and rip that army apart with seeming ease.\\nAs a book reader I've seen a half trained Jedi use the force to project into the minds of an entire imperial planet that he was their new dread.\\nIn video games? I've watched ...no BEEN... a half trained with lord as he pulled a Star Destroyer from the sky.\\n\\nThe films until now have allowed you to be comfortable in your knowledge of the force\\, even as the characters on the screen told you have no idea what the force can do.\\nThe Last Jedi puts you back in your place.\\n\\n\\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\"\\n-Luke Skywalker","true":true}
