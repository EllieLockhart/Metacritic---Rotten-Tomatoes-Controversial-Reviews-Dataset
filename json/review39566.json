Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film wasn't perfect of course\\, but it was different and unique\\, but there's just no pleasing Star Wars fans sometimes\\, you ask for something different here it is. Canto Byte scene could have been executed better\\, but I think everything else in it was amazing!","true":true}
