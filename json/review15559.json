Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved that this film was not a reboot\\, or a rehash. It was original\\, it was exciting. It took me out of my Star Wars comfort zone\\, and that is a good thing. Highest marks to Rian Johnson. I hope the fanboy faux keyboard outrage fits don't derail what he started.","true":true}
