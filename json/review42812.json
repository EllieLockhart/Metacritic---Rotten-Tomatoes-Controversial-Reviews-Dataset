Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not in the spirit of the true Star Wars.  It was dark and lacked any of the qualities that made the originial trilogy so great.  The depiction of Luke as an old negative has been was disheartening.  Having said all that\\, there were some great lines and as a regular sci-fi action movie it was entertaining. Not really interested to see the next movie if it's in the same vein.","true":true}
