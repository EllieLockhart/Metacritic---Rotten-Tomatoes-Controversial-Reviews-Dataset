Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this movie . It was unpredictable\\nFun to see over and over. All the actors did a great job.\\nI related to Luke Skywalker in this movie more then ever.\\nKylo Ren is my new favorite Star Wars villain! \\nThis movie did not feel long even tho it's the longest \\nStar Wars movie to date. \\nI highly recommend seeing this in 4D if available \\nThis was the best movie I ever saw in 4D \\nLove the porgs love rey love it all.","true":true}
