Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without trying to spoil too much\\, I was left equally disappointed and delighted by this latest entry. Delighted by the great cast and visuals\\, the more personal and emotional story where the stakes are higher than ever\\, disappointed by some plot decisions that spoiled the legacy of the venerated original trilogy and even the previous entry \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" for me. I can see the Star Wars franchise moving into a new direction that might be more appealing to newcomers\\, while turning off the die-hard fanbase with its light-hearted humor. Similarly to TV series \\\"Lost\\\"\\, another brainchild of J.J.Abrams (who served as producer here)\\, it feels like the plot was made needlessly convoluted in an attempt to subvert audience expectations and fan theories. Similarly\\, the plot of \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" jumps all over the place\\, with barely a moment to rest or feel some kind of gravitas. Sometimes it seems to only try and justify another overblown action sequence\\, rather than elegantly developing into a coherent whole. This shift in style left me feeling slightly alienated\\, and the increasing inconsistency in tone and vision across instalments reminds of other mega-franchises such as the Marvel Universe. Now that it has become clear that Disney doesn't have a master plan for this new trilogy\\, my expectations for the next entry are significantly lower than last time\\, and I can imagine many other fans would agree. Whether this is a good Star Wars movie or not depends on one's outlook on the series as a whole: honor tradition or venture to new faraway places? To see where \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" stands in this new trilogy\\, we will have to wait and watch the sequel.","true":true}
