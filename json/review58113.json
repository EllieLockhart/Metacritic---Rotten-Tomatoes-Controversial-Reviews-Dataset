Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie ever. THANK YOU disney for somehow ruining the best movie franchise EVER. How incompetent can you be? Rian Johnson and disney gave failed. Period. So many questions. TFW: So Kylo Ren can defeat some girl who has never held a lightsaber before? Hmm OK? Then with about 2 total hours of training\\, Rey is some amazing jedi now? BULLS***. How come every single intense scene (what we love) was made to be \\\"funny\\\" F****** incompetent!!!!!! what a damn shame. Every star wars fan i know hates dissent and rian johnson. The thing with princess leia - how weird and un-real (in star wars terms)!!!! Movies is slow\\, not serious\\, incompetent\\, terribly wrote. J.J. Abrams - well done\\, TFW set up 8 for AMAZING potential. And dumb** rain johnson ruined every second of it. How could loser kylo ben (who couldn't kill some untrained girl) able to kill snoke!???? WTF! Disney had no right to turn luke skywalker into the shell of a jedi he is. I could go on and on. DONE WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS GOSH-AWFUL MOVIE IF YOU ACTUALLY LOVE STAR WARS. GEORGE LUCAS - YOURE OUR ONLY HOPE!!!!!!!","true":true}
