Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography\\, score\\, and acting were all good... the rest is garbage.\\n\\nThe writing in this movie is definitely the laziest of the franchise. Suspension of disbelief is obliterated in the very first scene (Poe is Bugs Bunny; Hux is Elmer Fudd).  Character actions are illogical and when characters explain their logic\\, it doesn't hold water. The Force has become a lazy plot convenience device (more so). Technology \/ physics doesn't jibe with what had been previously established in the series - so much that it is absurd. The humor is childish. Character development is sloppy\\, forced\\, and spoon fed. All the intrigue that was built up in The Force Awakens is squandered. This is Phantom Menace\\, Attack of the Clones level bad. It is more fun than the prequel trilogy\\, but it is just so much stupider\\, lazier\\, and fatter (bloated with fluff) that this could be the worst episode of the franchise. It is definitely in the bottom three.","true":true}
