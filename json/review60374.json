If your expecting the original game you won\u2019t get it. They kill Joel off only 2 hours in then they brutally torture and beat Joel to death! I pre-ordered the game and when the leaks were coming out I was like nah not true boy I wrong! Guess what the woman who killed Joel guess what you play with her for 50% of the game acting like we would like her! I Finally got to the end then I was like yes kill her! Then she rememberers Joel then like oh no I don\u2019t want to kill her. This whole plot of the game was a revenge plot but guess what you don\u2019t get revenge and your whole family leaves you even worse you leave Joel\u2019s gatar then walks away leaves it! Hope they just pretend this game never existed then make a story about forgiveness\u2026 Expand","true":true}
