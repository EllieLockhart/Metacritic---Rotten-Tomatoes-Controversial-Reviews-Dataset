Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold\\, brilliant\\, beautiful\\, but challenging and\\, at times\\, off-kilter with the tone of the previous entries in the franchise. It's a matter of acceptance. It's a well-crafted and intelligent film\\, but it deliberately defies expectation and turns traditional cathartic moments inside out. This has had a polarising affect on fans\\, who have a love\/ hate relationship with Johnson's creative choices. But\\, they were his choices to make and I totally understood why he did what he did. He refutes nostalgia and embraces story service over fan service. Big themes are tackled and each character faces their hardest truths\/ choices. The plot is a little thick at times (with a little movie magic selling some of the key points)\\, but it's all well within genre acceptability and by the end of the film the Star Wars galaxy is shaken to its core\\, ready for a emotionally satisfying conclusion in Abrams hands.","true":true}
