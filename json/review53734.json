{"101487":123067,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Going with a solid 3*\\, largely because of how fantastically the movie handled and continued the lore of the force\\, while dismantling the concepts of the Jedi and the Sith.  A lot of overtones from the Clone Wars and Rebels cartoons were hit on in this movie\\, fleshing out what the force is\\, what the Jedi should have been\\, and how there must always be a balance between the light and the dark.\\n\\nMid-points of the movie are the blatant re-hashing of episode V and IV moments\\, the apparent lack explosive decompression when opening ships to space\\, and the clunky handling of Leia's demonstration of her own force abilities.  (which some of us have waited 30+ years to see).\\n\\nThe let-downs of this movie\\, however\\, are pretty major.  The entire sub-sub plot involving Finn and Rose is a complete bust.  Time that should have been dedicated to fleshing out Rey\\, Luke and Ben's past\\, as well as details about Snoke's origin were instead wasted on Canto Bight for absolutely no payout.  \\n\\nThe sub plot of Poe versus Holdo was contrived\\, forced\\, and unbelievable in every way possible.  I get it\\, Poe is \\\"impulsive and hot headed\\\"\\, but for the love of the force\\, creating two separate additional plots that are completely out of touch with the rest of the movie isn't the way to resolve that character flaw.\\n\\nThe handling of Luke is also extremely bad in my opinion.  At the end of RoTJ\\, he was on the top of the world\\, and the top of his game.  He was finally a confident\\, strong Jedi who was hopeful about rebuilding the order\\, but then we see what happened with Ben and that was enough for Luke to go on into a suicidally depressive existential crisis?  One where he was literally ready to just wait out his slow death on an island in the middle of no where instead of\\, you know\\, doing something about the horror he helped unleash on the universe?  Just like with Leia\\, I've waited 30 years to see the kind of awe-inspiringly impressive Jedi Master he had become\\, and instead we're given a broken\\, jaded shell of a man who has no reasons AT ALL to turn his back on his sister\\, his nephew\\, his best friend and the galaxy?  Terrible\\, and shameful.\\n\\nOverall\\, this movie was great in the things it did well\\, but was absolute garbage with everything else.  While I'm not exactly disappointed with it\\, I'd have to place TFA firmly\\, strongly above it in terms of quality\\, and only just above the prequels.  Maybe\\, honestly\\, even put it before Revenge of the Sith.  Overall\\, this movie was largely a waste of incredible potential.\\n\\nHope.  My only hope is that J.J. Abrams is able to close out this trilogy with a final\\, solid\\, satisfying Episode 9.","true":true}
