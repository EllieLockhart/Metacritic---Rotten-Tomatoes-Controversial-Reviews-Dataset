Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had high hopes for this movie when I saw it on Saturday. I bought my tickets in November and was excited when the critics' reviews came in. The sound is great along with the CGI\/photography. The story is too big of an issue for me. The way it jumps all over the place without much meat reminds me of watching Sesame Street. When the film was over I wondered what letter and number sponsored the episode. My kids enjoyed it and maybe that is who they are after\\, but that also brings up that its PG-13 and aimed to 8-12 year-olds. The holes in the story are huge and I can get over some things but this was too much. The film is the worst of the series and that includes the prequels. This film gives \\\"Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money\\\" so much to go on. I would love to have it come out soon so I can laugh off this garbage.","true":true}
