{"101487":101279,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-06-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All this negativity is why we can't have nice things. TFA was too close to the originals and the fans hated it\\, now TLJ is too far and they hate it. There's no winning. Honestly my rating is a 8.8\/9\\, but someone needs to offset all the 0's. Could have used a little less humor\\, let us live a little more in the emotion of the moment. That being said at least the jokes worked. SW has always been a little cheesy\\, and that's okay\\, but in my opinion they slightly cheapened the maturity of this entry. I liked the movement away from the black and white morality of the series\\, towards something more real and adult. This is a Star Wars film that's finally willing to acknowledge the grey areas\\, and I think the series is better for it. Yeah\\, there are still a lot of toy commercials in this\\, but it's SW\\, what do you expect?\\n\\nAll the things you want from the series are here. Space battles\\, ground battles\\, adventure\\, excitement\\, heroes and villains. The spectacle of it all is amazing\\, if not a little overlong. The saber duals featured here are by far the best choreography the series has ever seen. No spoilers\\, but about 2\/3 of the way through is a sequence that I don't think Lucas could have conceived on his best day. These expected moments are solid\\, but what this film really has going for it is when it steps away from those expectations. To start with there's actual character development\\, believable and relatable character growth! TLJ features some of the most nuanced people I've seen in a major studio franchise film. Finn could have used a little more to work with\\, but his B-story is still fun\\, and has some payoff for the future of the series. What always made Han so great was that he felt like a real person dropped into this fantastic world. His presence is missed\\, but Rey and Kylo make up for this in spades.\\n\\nThis finally feels like a new direction for the series\\, and as someone who grew up with the original trilogy\\, I'm happy to move beyond the characters that shaped my childhood. Those characters are still here\\, and feel so much more real than they ever have before. You can feel the weight of 30 years of war on all of them\\, especially when you look in Luke's eyes. Life seldom turns out the way you expect it to\\, and this movie acknowledges that. I think this sentiment is the exact reason so many have trouble with the film\\, they want a simple story of good versus evil. They want the heroes that they know and love to be challenged\\, but they also want it to be safe. This movie is not safe. It wants you to see beyond the space opera conflict. To see that the universe is larger than Rebels and Empires. It wants to break the cycle and become something more. I applaud the audacity of this\\, and enjoyed every moment in the theatre.","true":true}
