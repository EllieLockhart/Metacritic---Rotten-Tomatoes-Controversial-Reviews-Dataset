Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribly out of character scripts\\, wasted oporunities\\, forced characters that you'll never care for and cheesy oneliners badly delivered at all the wrong moments. \\n Just more recycled Original Trilogy with intresting twist that get backtracked for a safe bet.\\n It's not a movie for the fans but for new people\\, mostly kids","true":true}
