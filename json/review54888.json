Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's been almost a year and I still can't stop thinking about this film.   I think Mr Johnson did a phenomenal job in fleshing out all the characters.  I'm not sure what people are so upset about is Luke's fate that much different than ObiWan's.  If Leia feared the dark side  in  her own son what could we expect from Luke?  I actually thought it was brilliant that Rian Johnson chose to make it  a brief moment of uncertainty in Luke's mind.  This is Ben's story after all and it needed to be something big to turn Ben to the dark side.   You might think Luke was sacrificed for this purpose and rightly so but Luke will always be a Legend. We got to see him as a real person who makes mistakes\\, as human\\, and I think the Star Wars story is richer for it.   I know there are many other criticisms\\, I was just glad this wasn't another death star movie and the dialogue\\, yes I'm saying it\\,  is better than any Star Wars movie to date.   Leia-\\\"wipe that nervous expression off your face threepio\\\"\\, that cracked me up I think she was channeling Han in that moment.  As the middle movie in this trilogy it pays homage and respect to the films that came before it while still remaining a great stand alone film.","true":true}
