Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally loved the movie. It was emotionally intense and entertaining. The porgs were a bit of a marketing gimmick\\, but it's no where near as bad as some movie mascots have been\\, such as Ben from Treasure Planet. They didn't ruin the movie for me\\, so I can't really count them against this movie. It's surprising to see how much rage this movie is lighting. It's a fun and entertaining movie overall. Watch it for what it is and enjoy the ride without expecting too much. It's the middle movie of a trilogy. Those are often the weakest part of any trilogy\\, and they're typically used to build up the finale. You won't see a lot of fan theories confirmed with this movie\\, but that's okay. It took risks\\, not all payed off\\, but it was a good attempt and certainly worth the ticket price (at least in my opinion). And\\, don't let the opinions of others color your judgement. See it for yourself and develop your own viewpoints and feelings.","true":true}
