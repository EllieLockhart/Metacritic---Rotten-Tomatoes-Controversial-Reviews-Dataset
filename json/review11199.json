Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly garbage. Untrue to characters\\, pointless and boring\\, the worst star wars movie ever\\, and we're talking about a franchise with the phantom menace. An utter mess which ruins everything its predecessor tried to set up. The only good part of this movie is the final battle\\, and if that's not enough for you\\, then forget it.","true":true}
