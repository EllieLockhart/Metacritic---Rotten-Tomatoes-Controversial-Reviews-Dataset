Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clear and objective plot holes (Rey taking Snoke's ship off screen\\, all ships travel at the same speed\\, bombs based on gravity in outer space); revision and disruptive elements breaking the universe (ghost-Yoda interacting in reality\\, hyperspace weaponization); and the absolute betrayal of Luke's original story arc made this movie the worst in the franchise. The prequels were bad and poorly written but at least they did not go out of their way to trample on the original material. The Force Awakens did this to an extent as well but TLJ has destroyed this Skywalker saga for me. To accept this movie as canon would make our enjoyment and acceptance of Luke's passion for his father's good seem trite and naive in the original trilogy.  It isn't just that this is a poorly conceived movie with unforced errors (Admiral Akbar dies off-screen\\, Snoke doesn't even fight)\\, it made the other movies worse by tacking on a dismal conclusion to their plots. Imagine if JK Rowling came out with a new novel in which Harry has become a pedophile. That is the treatment this movie gave Luke.","true":true}
