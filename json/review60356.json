They should not be criticized on the basis of the ideas they try to defend\\, but on how well they are executed.\r\rGoing forward towards the game itself:\r\rGraphics - Visually\\, the game is stunning in every aspect. In particular\\, I think it distinguishes itself more by having one of the best lighting I have ever seen in a videogame. For a detailed technical analysis of the game\\, I recommend that you see the Digital Foundry analysis. The only problem I noticed was that sometimes there is some noticeable texture pop-in\\, but it is minor and understandable when you try to have the most detailed environments ever in PS4. Only God of War can rival with TLOU2 in this department as far as PS4 games go.\r\rSound - Maybe not as impressive as the graphics\\, but it is top tier for sure. The voice acting is extremely good\\, just as in the first game. The environmental sounds plus the soundtrack are as immersive as they can be. The sound of the gunshots feel very powerful and realistic. No complaints in this department.\r\rGameplay - It is basically a refined version of the first game.  The melee combat and the stealth feel better this time. The exploration is rewarding enough and the areas are much more open than in the first game. In my opinion\\, the gameplay is very solid and combined with the very good audiovisual design feels extremely entertaining.\r\rPlot - I feel that the story and the character development are top notch. Contrary to claims by some people here\\, I think the game respects the original characters\\, who are now living in a different context and in a different time. Maybe\\, by having a very ambitious and expansive scope\\, it loses some focus at some points compared to the first game\\, which is more restricted and simple. However\\, it is something never tried in videogames before\\, it is well executed and\\, in my view\\, it works amazingly well overall.\r\rI think this game is a masterpiece with few flaws. My rating would be 9.5\/10.\r\rPS: It might not work so well for some people\\, depending on each one's taste but certainly the game is not a 0\/10 and no one doing a proper review would give such a score as it can be seen from the professional reviews. It is still helpful if you also look at proper reviews that criticize several aspects of the game like Skill Up\\, Polygon or Kotaku.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
