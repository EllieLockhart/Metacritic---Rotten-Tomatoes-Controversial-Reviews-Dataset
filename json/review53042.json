Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a \\\"traditional\\\" Star Wars fan (meaning I was old enough to see the first three originals in theaters)\\, I went to this movie with my family hoping for the best.  I thought Rogue One was inspiring and fun.  Episode 7\\, despite being an unoriginal plot (essentially a re-boot of Episode 3)\\, was nonetheless a credible mix of new and old\\, with some touching moments\\, good new characters\\, lots of action\\, and (of course) amazing visual effects.  But sadly I was very disappointed with Episode 8: \\\"The Last Jedi\\\".  It should have been titled \\\"The Old\\, Confusing\\, Boring Jedi\\\".  I mean seriously\\, this movie was a text book example of how to destroy a beloved character.  This movie combined great special effects with poor writing\\, slow and boring pacing\\, pointless characters\\, long periods of little to no action\\, and plot holes big enough to drive a Star Destroyer through.  And then...there's Luke.  Sad\\, demented Luke.  Luke the Jedi Master who can't even win a fight against a girl with no training? Luke the Mentor who decides to go into the room of a sleeping student and kill him?  Luke the Leader who decides to run off and hide in a big old tree on an isolated island.  We waited 34 years to see THIS character?  Sad...","true":true}
