Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was honestly meh.... enjoyable..... but far too many plits\\, and it gives the finger to the audience by telling you everything you think matters doesnt matter. if you can turn your brain off youll enjoy it\\, but if you think about it\\, its get bad... and then worse","true":true}
