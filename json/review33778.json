Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie that not only bored me and the rest of the theater\\, but left Episode 9 in shambles as it killed any suspenseful questions fans of the series had. This movie featured lackluster comedy at the expense of the story\\, and has somehow topped the Prequels as the worst Star Wars movie to date.","true":true}
