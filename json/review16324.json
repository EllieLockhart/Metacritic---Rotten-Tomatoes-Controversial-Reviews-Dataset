Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what the hell movie the critics where watching.  Besides a few funny and nostalgic moments this was movie was horrendous.  There is very little character development and its like they ignored most of the force awakens.  And how the hell did del toro's character have any idea that they where evacuating the cruiser?  Finn and his partner did'nt even know that.","true":true}
