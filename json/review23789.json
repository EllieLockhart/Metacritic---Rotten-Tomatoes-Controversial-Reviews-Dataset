Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke throwing his old lightsaber over his shoulder was\\, symbolically\\, Rian Johnson throwing away everything that lead up to Episode VIII.  I could write for hours about the problems with the movie\\, but I'll sum it up with this: It's a waste of 40 years of love and lore.  The opposite of love is not hate\\, but indifference.  And this movie has somehow turned my love into indifference.  Literally\\, everyone in the mahogany trimmed boardrooms of Disney\\, that let this abomination pass the quality checks\\, should be ashamed of themselves.","true":true}
