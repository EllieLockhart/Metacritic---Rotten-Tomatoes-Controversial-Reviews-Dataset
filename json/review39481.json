{"101487":181236,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film ruined the new trilogy for me. Badly timed jokes\\, horrible story writing. The biggest joke was having an entire subplot that that didn't further the story at all and served only to save teddy bear horses and demonstrate the evils of capitalism... in a STAR WARS film... made by DISNEY!!! Yea\\, we're really feeling that message\\, guys. Have fun making gagillions off this and discussing how progressive you are at your next Hollywood cocktail party. Supposedly\\, this movie was supposed to show awesome female characters and feminist messaging. As if forcing your ideology and Earthly politics into a STAR WARS film set in a galaxy far\\, far away isn't ridiculous enough\\, you failed to even do that. Just look at how they failed with the female characters. Leia is an inneffective leader who can't seem to lead from the front (not to mention the most laughable moment of force use in the history of STAR WARS). Rose has no character arc that makes sense and her whole plot is useless. We meet her crying over her dead sister who gives her life in order to help save the resistance. After her and Finn's completely pointless plot on space Vegas\\, ber story gets worse. As Finn is about to sacrifice himself to save the resistance (you know\\, LIKE HER SISTER DID) she crashes her vehicle into his. The wreck from this could've easily killed one or both of them\\, adding to the stupidity. But then she delivers the stupidest reasoning when Finn asks her what she was thinking. Something about \\\"we fight for the ones we love.\\\" Um\\, yea\\, what do you think Finn was doing? What your sister did? And then she steals a kiss from him in what is supposed to be an emotionally lovely scene as the giant cannon Finn was about to immobilize blows away the door\\, potentially dooming \\\"the ones we love\\\" and the people her sister died fighting for. But hey\\, at least the directors can pat themselves on the back for having Asian female representation in a galaxy of billions of different kinds of sentient beings. Because that is somehow important\\, not having plot or good characters. And Rey was made into even more of a Mary Sue in this movie. I defended her character after TFA\\, saying we would get some more character development and actual training for the once scrap smuggler turned hero in the next film. Nope. She's just magically amazing and wins at everything just like the last film. She beats LUKE SKYWALKER after not using a saber or even knowing her force powers less than two weeks ago. People are bashing Daisy Ridley's potrayal\\, saying she seems like the same naive character we met on Jakku. Well\\, when there's hardly any development written into the script\\, that isn't the actresses fault. And no Daisy\\, calling Rey a Mary Sue is not \\\"sexist.\\\" Firstly\\, a gendered term doesn't automatically imply sexism. Secondly\\, a female character who is loved\\, sought after\\, and respected by EVERYBODY in the story and who always wins at everything is a Mary Sue. And don't get me started on Vice Admiral Social Justice. That whole plot with her and Po \\\"mansplaining\\\" Dameron went NOWHERE as well. Glad we got to see HER make the lightspeed sacrifice while Ackbar was dispensed like a useless prop and Leia did NOTHING. Hux and the entire First Order are portayed as bumbling Keystone Kops\\, which is why the humor is so cringey when combined with the amount of death and destruction they impune. And I could spend an hour explaing how this film completely trashes the character and original story arc of Luke Skywalker\\, the most beloved character in Star Wars history. And this film\\, which used an entire subplot to discuss evil capitalism\\, ends with a scene of kids playing with STAR WARS figurines and toys. IT ENDS WITH A SUBLIMINAL TOY COMMERCIAL. How stupid do you think we are? And the worst part of all this was having the directors and \\\"feminist\\\" producer demonize this films detractors as \\\"bigots\\,\\\" mysoginists\\, and \\\"afraid of strong female characters.\\\" That might be true if all the female characters outside of Ma-Rey Sue were strong. Collectively\\, they were a combination of useless\\, unrealistic\\, pointless\\, and cringeworthy characters\\, at best. And I'm done defending Rey as a character. Her journey thus far has been so unrealistic and incompatible with the rest of STAR WARS canon that it's unfollowable and unbelievable.","true":true}
