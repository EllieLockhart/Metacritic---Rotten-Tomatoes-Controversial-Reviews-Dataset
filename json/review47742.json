Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When Luke just casually tossed the light saber over his shoulder as a gag joke\\, my heart sank. Between that and all the other \\\"jokes\\\" (like the sappy phone call intro)\\, gimmicks\\, and cheesy one liners\\, it almost felt like a spoof. I also didn't like how Rian Johnson seemed to get a kick out story bait and switches: you think Kylo and Rey are enemies? Ah ha! Watch this! Now they have teamed up! But wait! Now they are enemies again!! But wait\\, now--\\nAfter a while as an audience member I started not trusting anything in front of my eyes\\, and because of that\\, I constantly felt like there was nothing to grab on to\\, nothing to ground myself with story wise. It was a bit like following a social media thread: stimulus\\, distraction\\, stimulus\\, distraction\\, stimulus\\, distraction\\, rapid fire over and over. This might be why it appealed to certain people; it's like the modern day internet. All flash and cheap thrills\\, no substance.","true":true}
