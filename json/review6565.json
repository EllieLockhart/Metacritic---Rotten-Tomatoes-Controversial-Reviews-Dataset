Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"doesn't feel like a sequel to the Force Awakens more like a stand alone. The way Luke was written for this movie was horrible\\, and I don't have enough time to write how bad Snoke and Rey was written for this movie. This movie makes the prequels feel more in line with the star wars story then every before","true":true}
