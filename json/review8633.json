{"101487":121421,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-10","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First things first\\, this is a bad movie\\, not like \\\"bad\\\" but like REALLY BAD\\, if the title didn't had the words Star Wars in it it would have flopped really hard (remember Tomorrowland?). But Disney knows that a high % of the audience would see the movie for these 2 words only\\, that's why they bought the license in the first place.\\n\\nIt has too many flaws to mention\\, but plot\\, tone\\, character creation\\, character development\\, pacing\\, editing\\, bad humor\\, miscast actors or internal logic comes to mind\\, just to mention a few.\\n\\nI'm not gonna talk about SJW and political agendas\\, because it's selfevident that this is an issue that affected the quality of the movie in a very bad way.\\nNo\\, I'm gonna talk about it as an Star Wars movie.\\n\\nThis is the worst SW movie I ever seen\\, much worse than the prequels. I didn't like them when they came but even with all their flaws I still felt they were SW movies\\, bad\\, but SW movies nonetheless.\\nThe Last Jedi has no soul\\, no magic\\, no charisma\\, no Star Wars. It disrespects The Force Awakens (I didn't like it)\\, it disrespects the prequels (easy thing)\\, it disrespects the originals (why?) and it disrespects their fanbase making cheap excuses or crediting the bad reviews to trolls or organized \\\"review-bombings\\\"\\, this is lame.\\n\\nAnd they keep making movies\\, a ton\\, Solo is gonna make money\\, but not as much as they though\\, the next one is gonna make a few less\\, and after a time SW will lose the status of \\\"must see\\\"\\, but they're gonna milk it every dollar possible and then they're gonna throw it into the trash.\\n\\nOne thing I agree with this \\\"movie\\\": \\\"Let the past die\\\". It was a good run\\, but it ended in 2012. I have no interest in new SW anymore. \\n\\nLet the past die\\, let SW die. There are many other fish in the ocean.","true":true}
