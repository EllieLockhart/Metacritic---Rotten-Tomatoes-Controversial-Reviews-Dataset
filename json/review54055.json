{"101487":130320,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-11-06","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an RT account just so I could voice my displeasure with this movie.\\n\\nI have loved Star Wars since I first saw the movies as a kid in the mid-80s. I have watched the original trilogy dozens of times and never get sick of them. TFA had its issues\\, but was accepted as a reboot and good start from Disney to get their new characters integrated into the saga. JJ opened lots of questions for the new trilogy to answer and I looked forward to that... I was excited after TFA. I liked Rogue One as well and saw both of these movies in the theater multiple times.\\n\\nThen The Last Jedi official trailer was released\\, which was amazing and everyone was excited! The hype was real! .....Then I saw the movie in the theater and was... disappointed... I hated flying Leia Poppins\\, killing off Luke in that terrible ending before he had a chance to showcase his Jedi skills after 35 years\\, the cheesy\\, cringy jokes\\, Hux is now a pussy\\, Kylo isn't intimidating at all\\, the entire boring Canto Bight side plot\\, the space chase plot because they couldn't catch the lighter ships? Or hurt them at range?\\, killing off Snoke so easily\\, and how over-powered Rey was with NO training...   The official trailer was a lie to get us into the theater. None of the terrible BS from this movie was in the trailer...\\n\\nAfter seeing this movie\\, I now feel like there is nowhere for IX to go\\, nothing left excites me and I just don't care anymore. I didn't see Solo because I wasn't interested in what LucasFilm\\Disney could offer me and I thought that Han was miscast. The Last Jedi has basically killed Star Wars for me going forward\\, and took The Force Awakens down with it. I still love the OT and the PT(especially the fan edits)\\, but have no interest in seeing what KK and her story team can offer me going forward. The new Clone Wars has potential\\, as long as Dave Filoni is in charge and KK keeps her grimy hands out of it.\\n\\nI thought the special effects\\, cinematography and SFX were quite good in TLJ\\, so I gave it 1.5 stars instead of .5.","true":true}
