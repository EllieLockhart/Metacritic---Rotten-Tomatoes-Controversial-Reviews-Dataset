Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"+ Some great effects and battle scenes\\n+ For the most part\\, Leia was great\\n+ Daisy Ridley's acting and characterisation\\n\\n- basic plot based around the opening crawl (first order is chasing the rebels) that has a lot of subplots but doesn't go much further\\n- The Snoke character is irrelevant\\n- Luke Skywalker is irrelevant\\, and mediocre.\\n- Every effort has been made to move away from the previous story\/lore which again\\, results in mediocrity. \\n\\nNot really sure where they go from here. I guess that they could add Lando in\\, and then kill him off too.","true":true}
