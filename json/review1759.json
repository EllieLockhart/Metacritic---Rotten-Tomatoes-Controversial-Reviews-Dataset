Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, I really didn't like this movie. Rian Johnson messed up on so many levels with this movie. There was barely any story\\, so many characters were ruined\\, and most of the jokes\/bathos used in this film just made it not feel like a Star Wars movie. I could name so many more problems but I won't because everyone knows the rest. The only thing I liked from this movie was the cinematography and effects.","true":true}
