Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much comic relief. Finn\u2019s character is annoying and a buffoon\\, and his part of the storyline served no purpose. Rey and Luke\u2019s storyline very good. Rebel storyline made little to no sense (Star Destroyers couldn\u2019t catch up to the rebel ships until they ran out of gas? - they could outrun the Millennium Falcon in every other Star Wars movie!). Basically\\, the writers of this movie sort of sucked. So disappointed. 2 1\/2 hours could be scrunched into 1 1\/2 hour good movie by removing Finn parts.","true":true}
