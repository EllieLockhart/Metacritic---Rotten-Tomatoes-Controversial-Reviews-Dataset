I loved the first game and replay it to this day\\, and the sequel definitely lives up to the first last of us. Before writing this I was trying to come up with some drawbacks to my experience and I honestly couldn\u2019t find anything more more substantial than your A.I. Parter getting in your way not unlike the first game except it happens a lot less. It\u2019s a shame that all these sheep that you can tell haven\u2019t played the game are review bombing the game so harshly. Hopefully as real players finish the game the score will go up. As stated in the beginning I ha ent finished the game but I will be updating this review. If the game ended right now it\u2019s be enough for me to say go buy it. Definitely taking the top spot for my favorite game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
