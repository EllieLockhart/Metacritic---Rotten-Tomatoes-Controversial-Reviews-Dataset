OMG\\, this game is so good gameplay wise and specially the graphics\\, presentation. The story was sad and some parts a little disappointing but that doesn\u2019t matter because the gameplay is what really matters. Breath of the wild\u2019s story suffered by not being as deep as it\u2019s predecessors\\, but was universally praised for its good gameplay and presentation. It is the same thing here\\, a very good quality triple A title here so good you will want to play it again once you beat the campaign. There were some slight changes to the gameplay and combat system but not big changes but is okay as the first game mechanics were near perfect so it wasn\u2019t necessary to completely change the combat system. What we got here is a good game that deserves a chance as NaughtyDog keeps doing what it does best a very fun game that really entertains you\\, as that\u2019s what the video games are in the first place\\, to have fun. Please play this game is very fun\\, you might not like where the direction of the story goes but the overall game is what really matters. Stop listening to those haters who negatively reviewed this game and they haven\u2019t even played it or even completed the first five hours of the game. Or didn\u2019t even like the first game in the first place as they suck at it from the beginning. If you like the challenge in a game and using your head often this game is for you\\, you won\u2019t be disappointed. This is a masterpiece that will be talked forever as one of the most controversial games in this decade. Worth the wait.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
