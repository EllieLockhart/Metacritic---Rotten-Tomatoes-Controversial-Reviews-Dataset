Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had such high hopes\\, and was so disappointed.  None of the questions raised in Episode 7; the \\nMary Sue Awakens were answered.  Who was Snoke? How did we get from episode 6 to episode 7?\\nThis movie should be called \\\"The Last Mary Sue\\\" ( we should be so lucky ).  Every male character \\nis either immoral or incompetent.  Every female character was both fundamentally moral and basically\\nright and competent.  If the SJWs who made this disaster want to spread their misandry effectively\\nthen they need to at least make a good movie with a main character that doesn't effortlessly win\\nevery confrontation.  Shallow characters\\, the movie makes no sense.  SJW garbage.","true":true}
