Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People expect too much from a series that has always been based on pulp tropes. It's *supposed* to be kind of goofy and imperfect. The Japanese call that \\\"wabi-sabi.\\\" The Italians call it \\\"sprezzatura.\\\" The best parts of this entry must be included with the very best parts of the series. No exaggeration. I loved it.","true":true}
