Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"was ok but was a little underwhelmed by it all. loved force awakens just flowed. last Jedi just seemed to be flashbacks. a supreme leader a troubled apprentice an over reliance on fluffy creatures. a revel alliance that is on its knees yet again yoda seemed to be a little flat I'm sorry to say but with all respect Carrie Fisher is not the best actress she just seems a little to rigid to me.  the casino was pointless to me not enough of max a very important character in the first film.\\nI'm sorry but one x wing fighter doing that at the start is a bit over the top. in the force awakens they manage to hit the tie fighter but not an x wing it all just seemed to be to much.","true":true}
