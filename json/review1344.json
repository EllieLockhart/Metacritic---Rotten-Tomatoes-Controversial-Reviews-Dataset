Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Arguably one of the best movies in the series\\, The Last Jedi is an incredible experience from the score to the cinematography to the depth of the characters and themes on a level Star Wars has never reached before now.","true":true}
