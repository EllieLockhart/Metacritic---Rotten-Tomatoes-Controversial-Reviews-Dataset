Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars movie. The only good things about it is the acting\\, Not the characters\\, but the acting\\, the visuals\\, and the music.","true":true}
