Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was awful. It was way too long for its little content. \\nAlso there was never really a sensible character development. \\n\\nIn Comparison with the other Star Wars movies\\, this was the worst of them. \\nStar Wars V: The empire strikes back\\, has shown us that a really good second part in a trilogy is possible. And Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, was the opposite of that.","true":true}
