Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning. Spoiler alert. Some incongruity in places. Fun\\, nonetheless. It is sad to realize that Leia (Carrie Fisher)\\, Luke Skywalker . (character)\\, and Hans Solo (character) are now gone. Fortunately they live on in the fan fiction. I really hate how Disney has so changed the story from where the hundreds of fan fiction books took the story (with Lucas's blessing). ","true":true}
