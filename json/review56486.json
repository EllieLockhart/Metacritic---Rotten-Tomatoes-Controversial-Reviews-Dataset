Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The final nail in the coffin that made me quit whatever StarWars\\, that Disney puts out. Just like I quit Star Trek.\\n\\nAt the moment I am perfectly fine with reading any StarWars book published pre-2012\\, before watching any of these feminist-infected logic-deprived SJW-trash filled with character-assassinations of any known male. I was appalled that they weren't even subtle about what their agenda was. Force Awakens was at least watchable.\\n\\n2 months before watching this in december I began to see the signs after classifying the structure that these people uses to base their story around. Because they don't care about keeping inside the boundary of established lore or create characters that has exciting and interesting challenges to overcome and grow from. Both inside and outside.\\nSJW's has an idea that they want to show women as morally superior in any way\\, while men being brutish and wrong\\, even though they actually have a point.\\n\\nBut that is not all. Every decision for this movie's story was completely retarded and it wasted every interesting plotline and characters to the point of stupidity. And that is not counting Luke Skywalker's 180 degree change in his personality without any reasonable justification other than to tell a joke and make the main character of Rey being even more morally superior than she already is. Everything was so dull.\\n\\nThe movie effectively killed off anything that was interesting in StarWars(from Force Awakens) to the point that there is absolutely no reason to watch it anymore.\\n\\nBut it is all okay\\, I believe. Even though they wasted the opportunity to having Carrie Fisher\\, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford back in these movie\\, this will stand as a testimony of how to not treat a franchise as the market balances itself out\\, and no one caring anymore whenever Disney puts out more StarWars.\\n\\nI will be fine reading through loads of books from the legends canon\\, knowing that it can only be much better than this crap. Maybe in 10 - 15 years\\, StarWars will come back in the way it should be...\\n\\nUntill then\\, I will do other stuff :D","true":true}
