Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know that there is an Alt-right campaign against this movie for the very things I liked--its universalist religious undertones\\, its multi-culturalism\\, its strong women. And it had more humor than most episodes.","true":true}
