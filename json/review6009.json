Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Waited 2 years for this? I understand that you have to move on from the old characters but this movie was not good. I think the movie everyone wants to see is before the force awakens. Like finding new people to train\\, setting up the academy and watching How strong Luke is and Ben turning. That would have been awesome.","true":true}
