Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The first game is my favourite game of all time. Not for the graphics\\, crafting\\, enemy AI\\, shooting mechanics as they were all somewhat flawed\\, the reason is for the characters and story.\r\rThe Last of Us Part 2 has improved its mechanics certainly but the story and treatment of beloved characters is like some sort of parody. I suppose I'm glad Joel was killed of early as he was spared the character destruction Ellie received. Once the funny smart mouthed glimmer of hope in this world\\, shes become frankly a resentful angry and selfish husk of her former self. Jessie and Lev were the only decent new characters for me.\r\rI don't understand the logic of Abby's decisions at all. Her father wanted to kill Ellie without giving her a choice. Later in the game she cares deeply for 2 people who saved her life\\, turning on her own to help them. However when Joel saves her she doesn't just kill him\\, she brutally tortures him\\, and we are suppose to empathise with this person.\r\rWaited a long time for this game\\, now I just don't care\\, but wonder.......................... is this how Naughty Dog wanted people to feel?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
