Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many times this film gets you on the edge of your seat then finds a way to disappoint. Awful handling of much loved characters and an introduction to characters that will be fogotton before the credits roll. The  thunderously stupid Plot made me snigger but not out of amusement but to hopefully disguise my sobs of frustration. Some excellent space battles intertwined with plot holes you could fly a star destroyer through. Certain scenes in the casino seemed to be taken from the cutting room floor\\n of the phantom menace. I'll still be excited for ep9\\, course I will but my expectations have been slashed dramatically. For me\\, walking out the cinema\\, I had a similar feeling as when I came out of kingdom of the Crystal skull. Yes\\, that bad. Help me jj Abrams\\, you're my only hope!","true":true}
