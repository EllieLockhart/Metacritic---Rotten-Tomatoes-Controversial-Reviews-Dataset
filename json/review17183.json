Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this film. I was worried about the beginning due to all of the jumping and skipping\\, followed by numerous really dumb scenes. Once they got the junk out of the way\\, it became good. It seemed to be going down the road of mixing Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi\\, but then took a great turn. I like how the director took the complaining fans had from episode 7 and decided to veer off of the same beaten path. Ironically\\, which seems to be one of the complaints fans are now having as they disliked the new path and wanted more of the same. I also like how the director chose to not include all of the silly fan theories. I also like how Rey doesn't have any ties to the existing families\\, but show to be in touch with the force\\, quite possibly stronger than Luke. This was pretty much an out with the old\\, in with the new movie. I think Rose was a waste though. Could have done without all of her scenes. All-in-all\\, this was a good movie. Could it have been better? Most definitely.","true":true}
