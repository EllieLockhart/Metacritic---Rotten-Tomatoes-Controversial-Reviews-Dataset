Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what I just watched. I tried to stay strong for my wife since she's new to all this and really enjoys Star Wars but I just couldn't. The only force that seemed strong in this movie was PC culture. Honestly\\, I could get past that if the movie was remotely close to resembling anything I remember a Star Wars film being. I won't give any spoilers; the only point I'll try to make to other relatively huge Star Wars fans is that this move is \\\"unrealistic\\\" for what Star Wars realism is considered. As I'm writing this I've been closing my eyes\\, trying to keep my focus but each time I close my eyes I say to myself: \\\" Why\/how could this movie be released like this?!\\\" It kills me to say this but I genuinely couldn't stand watching the movie. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I just don't get why Disney shit all over Star Wars like this! They save the life of a dead women who's character was never the focus of the film to kill off Luke Skywalker!!! It's over...Star Wars is over.","true":true}
