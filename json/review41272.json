Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disaster\\, pure and simple. The stakes are all over the place\\, the plot-threads started in the last movie are wasted\\, and all the great themes of the Star wars saga are destroyed (transmission\\, gradually learning how to become a hero\\, redemption).\\nLuke Skywalker deserved better than being portrait as a suicidal bum. And Carrie Fisher's final performance is ruined by the most ridiculous scene of the entire saga. What a shame.","true":true}
