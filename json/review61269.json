The story is seriously lacking and the game play is overhauled completely from the first game\\, except this time we don't have interesting characters to keep pushing us through the game hour after hour.

The expectations were high i admit\\, and this was a difficult task\\, but this writing feels lazy and shows no respect to the first game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
