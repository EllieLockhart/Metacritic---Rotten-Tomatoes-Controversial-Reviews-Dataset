Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's star wars so it starts at a 2-star rating. The extra 1\/2 star was because it looked pretty. In all honesty it was worse than Attack of the Clones. I'm not going to get into all the details\\, but everything has already been said by other reviewers. This is probably the only Star Wars film I will never watch again....unless my 8-year old wants to watch it.","true":true}
