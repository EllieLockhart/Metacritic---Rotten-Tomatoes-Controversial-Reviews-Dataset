{"101487":187346,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-08","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This picture\\, sadly\\, made no real attempt to tell a coherent story. It seemed to have no self awareness that it was following a previous installment\\, Episode VII\\, or that this obligated its writers to pick up\\, develop\\, and\/or resolve certain plot plot points that this prior film had set up. Instead of doing this\\, the writers of Episode VIII either ignored seemingly important plot elements from the previous installment\\, or outright dismantled them and made them irrelevant. Let's discuss a handful of notable examples:\\n\\n1) Episode VII's central plot revolved around Luke Skywalker's disappearance and the search for him by the film's leading characters. Luke actually left a map for people to be able to find him\\, implying that he WANTED to be found. Well\\, the proganist finds him at the conclusion of that film. Episode VIII picks up with a Luke Skywalker that doesn't want to be found\\, and who is unwilling to confront the antagonist faction that is ravaging the Galaxy. Our protagonist\\, Rey\\, never asks the glaringly obvious question: \\\"You left us a map to find you. WHY?\\\" All Luke does is mope and whine about the failures of the Jedi Order (utterly out of character for the Luke of old\\, but that's a different criticism). He gives no indication that he wanted to be found (instead he's angry and annoyed that he has been located)\\, and refuses to go back and join the fight. Viewers are left wondering what the point of Episode VII was. The film was about the search for Skywalker\\, who'd left clues for those trying to find him. But this plot point was totally ignored and disregarded here in VIII. So what was the point\\, really? When you pick up a film following another in a series like this\\, you can't just say\\, \\\"no\\, screw that\\\" to the central plot of your predecessor. That's just bad writing. And it was utterly confusing to the audience and even casual fans not heavily invested into Star Wars lore.\\n\\n2) Episode VII introduces Snoke as the enigmatic evildoer who is responsible for the leadership of the First Order (and perhaps its creation)\\, and more importantly\\, the seduction of Ben Solo (Vader's grandson) to the dark side of the Force. Fine enough. It was also fine that this film didn't give much information about this character. It poised the next film for a big reveal about this character. Instead\\, VIII basically says \\\"Yes\\, he's just some evil guy\\, pretty powerful\\, but his backstory doesn't matter and we're not going to give it to you.\\\" And then promptly kills him off. Here's why that's bad writing. In the Original Trilogy\\, we don't need much information on the Emperor because it's at the beginning of the Star Wars saga (from a production perspective\\, this was the first trilogy). We already knew the Empire was evil\\, and we readily accepted that its leader must be similarly evil\\, and very powerful too since Vader called him \\\"master.\\\" The Star Wars universe wasn't fully fleshed out yet\\, so the introduction of this character without his full backstory worked. But now\\, a half dozen films later\\, we DO have an established fictional universe. This means that when you introduce characters that are significant and enormously powerful\\, you need to EXPLAIN who they are and give at least some information about them. Other than his name\\, we get none of this regarding Snoke. Just like in the previous point\\, Episode VII devoted a lot of narrative energy to setting up this plot point for a rich development and\/or reveal in Episode VIII. Instead\\, the sequel's writers said: \\\"No\\, let's kill this character off and reveal nothing. We're telling our own story\\, forget following any conventions of the previous film.\\\" Narratively\\, this is jarring to any audience member and makes for disjointed\\, bewildering storytelling. The filmmakers want us to watch the special effects and be awed and mesmerized\\, but not to scrutinize the plot (which stands up to very little of this activity).\\n\\n3) Luke Skywalker. He gave up hope? He seriously considered murdering a sleeping child (his nephew\\, the son of his SISTER and his BEST FRIEND)? Are the writers seriously asking us\\, the audience\\, to believe that this is the same character from the Original Trilogy\\, or are they just using his name for branding? The latter seems true. The Original Trilogy takes great pains to show how optimistic\\, courageous\\, and compassionate Luke Skywalker is. He was willing to die\\, himself\\, to redeem his father. He defeated Vader in a duel and then refused to kill him as he lay helpless on the ground. He risked everything because he believed that even those who fall as hard as Vader can be saved. He confronted THE SECOND MOST EVIL PERSON IN THE GALAXY -- a Sith Lord\\, who\\, in addition to being a merciless killer\\, was complicit in the destruction of an entire planet -- and still he had faith that he could return him to the light. THAT LUKE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THIS FILM. The real Luke would never even consider harming a child. The real Luke would never have given up. There are three films that are all about Luke's goodness\\, his hopefulness. Episode VIII takes these central themes and trashes them. What a shameful way to send off a character that was a positive role model for so many. Not only is it poor writing\\, it's also a despicable way to treat legacy so carefully crafted and so dearly held.\\n\\nI could go on about the writing flaws of this film\\, but I've made my point. The special effects were gorgeous\\, but I must say that in the end\\, this film was filled with sound and fury\\, but ultimately signified nothing. I was worse than disappointed. I'm not a fanboy that has to see his own personal fantasy on the screen. I encourage writers and filmmakers to take risks\\, to take Star Wars into new and uncharted territory. This film set out to be different\\, to break the mold. I applaud that goal. One of Episode VII's key flaws that it didn't do enough that was new. So this review is not about my opposition to taking Star Wars in a novel direction. This review is about bad storytelling. Episode VIII could very well have gone new places with the saga without resorting to an elementary disregard for basic narrative conventions. Pick up the threads of the previous installment. Resolve them quickly if you must\\, but don't just ignore them. If you're going to have central characters do a total 180 with regard to their morals and central motivations\\, you have to EXPLAIN how they got there instead of just telling us what they've done with no exposition and then expect us to believe it. I have news for Disney and Lucasfilm: audiences aren't as daft as you think. You have to try to tell a cohesive story\\, you can't just sedate everyone with gorgeous effects and visuals. None of that is worth spit unless it's backed up by a real story. George Lucas said \\\"you're using tools to tell a story\\,\\\" not the other way around. The filmmakers got this utterly backward\\, and the result is this confusing mess of a movie. \\\"Wasted opportunity\\\" doesn't even come close to describing what this was.\\n\\nFinal note: I'm an individual person\\, not a robot. I am not part of some wide-reaching\\, insidious campaign to \\\"review-bomb\\\" this movie on Rotten Tomatoes. I did create an account for the sole purpose of posting this review though. I found the flaws of this movie\\, and the motives of those responsible for its creation\\, to be egregious enough to warrant my doing this. There is a pretty good reason that this film has\\, at the time of my writing this\\, a paltry 50% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. That reason is this: this is a bad movie\\, not only in fact but also according to \\\"the wisdom of the crowd.\\\" The \\\"professional\\\" critics who handed overwhelmingly positive reviews to this film have lost a LOT of credibility. They're either 1) not very good film critics\\, 2) too afraid to lampoon anything Disney makes\\, even bad films\\, or 3) paid off by Disney to give this film good PR. Or a combination of the three. The fact is\\, this movie is not good\\, it earned its Audience Score\\, and any folks writing online to discredit these facts (alleging\\, for instance\\, that reactionary trolls are using bots to \\\"review bomb\\\" this film\\, even though Rotten Tomatoes itself has convincingly and thoroughly dismissed this) are simply delusional or too scared to admit that this picture is bad. Please don't spend any money to see this if you'd prefer to watch a good movie. There isn't one to be found within this picture.","true":true}
