Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t understand all of the hate and disdain that some people are giving. For TFA\\, people were like: \u201cOmg it\u2019s too much like the original trilogy\\, UGHH.\u201d This movie took many risks in the plot and some of you are now saying \u201cUGHH\\, this isn\u2019t like the Star Wars movie I\u2019m used to.\u201d There\u2019s no satisfying everyone\\, but I think the movie did a great job and I was thoroughly entertained. Congrats to the cast on a job well done.","true":true}
