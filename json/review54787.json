Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think fans are objecting to the direction Rian Johnson took the franchise.  And\\, while his choices are nothing like I would have wanted for Luke and the gang\\, the movie he made (minus all of Canto Bight) was outstanding.  There are some phenomenal set pieces\\, better than average Star Wars acting performances\\, and an extremely satisfying flawed villain in Kylo Ren. I will see it again tonight\\, and in time\\, the disappointed fans will come around on this one if they see it again too.","true":true}
