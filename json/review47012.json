Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment. Has the director even watched a Stars Wars Movie? What they did to Luke is disgraceful. We all have been waiting 40 years to see Luke truly wield the force and this is what we are given! Then look at the whole plot line with Po and pals and it literally was the whole movie to find out everything they did was an utter waste of time!!!!!! The whole story line is just sad and so disappointing. Number one movie in the world and only 50% of real every day movie goers give it a positive review.That\u2019s telling.","true":true}
