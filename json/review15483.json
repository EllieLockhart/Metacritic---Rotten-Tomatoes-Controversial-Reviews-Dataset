Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it! It was fresh\\, the twists were new and more impactful and now we have an epic good vs bad going in for episode 9. In short it gave us the bad guys winning at the end and the good guys beaten down\\,  leaving with just their lives but with a hope for the future. It also made Jedi storyline and the end game more interesting as now the showdown feels more global and personal that in any other time in the star wars universe.","true":true}
