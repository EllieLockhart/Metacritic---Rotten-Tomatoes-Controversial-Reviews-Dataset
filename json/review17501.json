Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I seldom pay much attention by the critics reviews\\, but do on the people who see the movie.  I read so many bad reviews on this movie\\, I almost didn't go see it.  However\\, my son wanted to see it\\, so I went ahead and went with him.  I was expecting a bad movie\\, but WOW was I shocked!  It was one of the best Star War movies I have ever seen.  Just a really GREAT movie!!","true":true}
