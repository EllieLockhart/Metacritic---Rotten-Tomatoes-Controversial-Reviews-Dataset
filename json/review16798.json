Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Intellectually disrespectful to any Star Wars fan who would have hoped Disney & LucasArts actually cared enough to build and improve the franchise.\\n\\nThere are moments of real brilliance here\\, but they are overshadowed by overall objectively lazy storytelling.\\n\\nJJ Abrams's influence from the reboot and obvious conscious (or unconscious) meddling into Rian Johnson's storytelling ruins it for anyone who actually wants their brain to be stimulated in addition to their eyes\\, ears\\, and heart. \\n\\nSuggestion: chug some rum-fortified egg nog with a drop of blue and two drops of green food coloring before watching this flick.","true":true}
