Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Folks...this movie looked great\\, but that was impossible to truly appreciate due to illogical and downright idiotic writing.  A ridiculous plot and virtually no character development.  Who are our heroes? If you can help me get to know them\\, please do.  Its not even about being faithful to the saga\\, that's another discussion.  This\\, as a stand alone film\\, was difficult to get through.","true":true}
