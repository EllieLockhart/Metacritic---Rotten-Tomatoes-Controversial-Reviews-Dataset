Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Annoying that the critics gave this movie a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes.. waste of my time and money. I sincerely regret going to this shitty ass movie based on the great rating it got on this website. I will no longer visit this website.","true":true}
