Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With glaring plotholes\\, forced humor\\, head scratching writing and misuse of Luke Skywalker arguably the most popular Star Wars character. The Last Jedi lacks the spirit of Rogue One and the Star Wars experience many fans wanted - especially the ones who have been there since the original trilogy.\\nWith Rian Johnson and J.J. Abrams leading movies in the future\\, this may not be The Star Wars you are looking for.\\nThe Last Jedi also brings up the question: What movie did the critics watch?","true":true}
