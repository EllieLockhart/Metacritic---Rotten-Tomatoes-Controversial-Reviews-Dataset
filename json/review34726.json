Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The day after. I sit here this morning trying to wrap my head around what I saw last night. It's better than the prequels\\, but\\, not near as spectacular as The Force Awakens or Rouge One. It's pretty good. But definitely not great. \\n\\nLast Jedi does not deserve the honor that it is receiving from critics or the media. While there are some nice moments\\, it simply did not work for me. As fast as The Force Awakens had me caring about these characters\\, the Last Jedi has me feeling indifferent towards them now.\\n\\nThis falls on Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy. Their job was to build off the story of TFA and give us a sequel that flowed well and moved that story forward. Instead\\, Kathleen gave it over to Rian who made an indie movie that acknowledges the story that began in TFA\\, but\\, feels like it should fall between TFA & a future Episode 8\\, yet has too much impact on the overall story to set-up a future Epi 8 well.   \\n\\nRian does not give JJ much to work with for Episode 9\\, however\\, if anyone can dig us out of the mess that Last Jedi left us with\\, in JJ I trust.","true":true}
