Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. I have my issues with it\\, like virtually any movie\\, but that didn't stop me from enjoying myself. Is it the best Star Wars movie? No! But it's nowhere near the worst.","true":true}
