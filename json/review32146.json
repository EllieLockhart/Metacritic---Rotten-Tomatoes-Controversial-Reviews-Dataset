{"101487":169583,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER WARNING>>>> I'll tell ya quickly why The Last Jedi is terrible...So Luke never got his happy ending\\, ya see\\, he struggled SO much - his aunt & uncle got burned alive\\, his mentor Ben Kenobi is murdered\\, his hand gets chopped off\\, his evil father dies. He's had SO much misery\\, it'd be nice to see him 30 yrs later happy\\, with a wife & a few kids maybe? But no\\, it was all for nothing. His reward for all those acts of Jedi heroism is to die alone on an Island\\, never getting married & not having any cool lightsaber battles. Mark Hamill is pissed I'm sure. Disappointed as hell after so much good reactions from the premiere. Leia floating in space doing Mary Poppins was too stupid and felt completely out of place. Rey was awesome\\, Mark Hamill did a great job\\, but now I see why he was \\\"fundamentally against\\\" what Rian Johnson did with his character in the script. All the character arc's fell flat\\, accept maybe Poe & Hux. The John Williams music was amazing\\, every single bit of it\\, but struggled to keep the ill-conceived script afloat. It doesn't make my top 3\\, even top 4 Star Wars movies. Maybe on par with The Phantom Menace.. I am very disappointed. JJ Abrams did such an AMAZING job with The Force Awakens & handed Rian Johnson a gem. But instead of polishing it\\, he smashed it & arrogantly ignored all the beautiful The Force Awakens mythology.. How could Lucasfilm approve this script???!!! UGH ..Luke & Rey deserved better.","true":true}
