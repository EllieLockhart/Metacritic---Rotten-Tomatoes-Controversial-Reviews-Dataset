Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of Us Part 2 was created to increase the deepness of this entire zombie world\\, adding some interesting points of view of what is like to become the villain of your own story.\rThe gameplay doesn't take any risk on making anything new\\, but it has the same mechanics and functionality of its predecessor. The only flaw that I was able to find were some minor bugs\\, witch could be easily fixed.\rSomething that separates this game from anyone of its genre\\, it's the way it shows dead on NPC's. It's suffering feels real and you won't be feeling comfortable killing others on this game.\rIt's story\\, the main focus of this game is amazing. Naughty Dog took a risky path by choosing a story that would make angry to any fan\\, but further than staying on a classic heroe theme\\, it goes further and deeper. Joel's dead at the very beginning of the game states the tone of the rest of the gameplay\\, and gives Ellie a strong reason to seek revenge\\, but after  some events on the main story Ellie finds out that love it's the most important thing\\, reflected on her finally forgiving Joel for not letting her die on the first game.\rAlthough most fans didn't like the game on a first place\\, I'm sure that time will do justice on what was achieved on this game\\, and most players will some time be deeply in love with Ellie's and Abby's story. A must play for anyone that owns a PS4.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
