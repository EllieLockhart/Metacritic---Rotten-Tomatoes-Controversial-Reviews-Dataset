Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first time reviewing a movie on Rotten Tomatoes and the reason I'm doing one now is because this movie had me so angry and upset leaving the theatre. The character development was nowhere the writing was sloppy and Luke was way out of character. The whole side plot with Finn and Rose didn't matter because it literally accomplished nothing. Roses character was literally the representation of Disney with her feel good moments and her anti establishment agenda. Don't get me wrong I'm all for anti establishment\\, but this movie was force shoving it down your throat. Roses character was pointless and so is Finns now\\, with completely no character development what so ever. The humor was over the top and any question you had from the force awakens was either dismissed or given a big fuck you. Hopefully JJ can save this trilogy because I genuinely did like the Force Awakens even with all its similarities to A New Hope.","true":true}
