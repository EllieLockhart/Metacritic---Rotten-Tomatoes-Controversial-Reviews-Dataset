Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a frustrating movie to watch. The worst part is a sloppy set of stories\\, following characters on their pointless side quests\\, through the film; the auxiliary stories do not even effect the main plot! Also\\, so many things about being in space are taken too lightly; how could a spaceship have an open cabin with people running around without oxygen suits and space just outside - the rebel bombers at the beginning; if there is an invisible barrier\\, you must show it!","true":true}
