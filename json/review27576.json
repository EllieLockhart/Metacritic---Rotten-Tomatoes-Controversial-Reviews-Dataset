Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, this movie was a huge disappointment. Rian Johnson should have watched The Force Awakens before writing and directing The Last Jedi. There was a great deal of inconsistency between Force Awakens and Last Jedi. Most disappointing of all was Rian Johnson's irresponsible portrayal of Luke Skywalker. It felt like Rian Johnson had a vendetta against Luke Skywalker and was determined to end the legend of Luke Skywalker with an inexplicable whimper rather than the heroic bang that such a character deserves. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of his portrayal of this character. The movie went on inexplicable detours into characters and storylines that were meaningless and unnecessary. Hopefully JJ Abrams can save this debacle in the next episode\\, but Rian Johnson really limited what JJ Abrams has to work with. Overall\\, this movie felt like a bad dream. Rian Johnson did everything you hoped a writer\/director would not do with such a fabled story. ","true":true}
