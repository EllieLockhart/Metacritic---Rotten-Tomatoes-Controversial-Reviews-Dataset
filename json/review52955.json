Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a pile that spits in the face of loyal fans having the attitude of i will do all i can to unravel the story I was trusted to continue in the tradition of those before me. Stunning to look at and view but an erupting volcano is also a majestic and beautiful thing to see\\, the point being it's still rather destructive. Pod race 2.0 was a waste along with that entire plot line\\, space leia lame and do you think the pilot who shot got force ass kicked by kilo when they landed? where was that? I think the thing that annoyed me most was the whole laze fare attitude. I did appreciate the nod to the original Yoda and R2's playing of the holo image from a new hope.","true":true}
