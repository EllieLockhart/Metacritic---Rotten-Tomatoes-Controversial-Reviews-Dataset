Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With the clear intention of moving away from the Lucas Legacy\\, this Director has consumated the machiavellian Disney's plan of turning SW saga in one size fits all current tendencies: ultra-feminism\\, anti male\\, ultra-diversification\\, pro-millennial ranks...\\n\\nAnd all of that could be achieved without destroting what has been the core of this epic fable: the story of the Skywalkers and the Jedi Order and its ways. \\n\\nIn place of that Disney present us one story of a disgraced hermit Luke Skywalker that has forgotten all of his vows and virtues\\, a movie where all the masculine figures are stupid\\, malign\\, flawed or plain \\\"trouble-maker\\\" and all feminine figures are virtuous\\, heroic\\, powerful\\, merciful\\, victorious. ..\\n\\nNot a single figure that contradicts that...\\n\\nSuddenly the Skywalkers are exctinct....the Jedi and its ways are useless... the Force can be tamed without a school (such a teenager dream)...\\n\\nHow disappointed I was with this movie...to the point of almost lose all interest in all SW related.","true":true}
