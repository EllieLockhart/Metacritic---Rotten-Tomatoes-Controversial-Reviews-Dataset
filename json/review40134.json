Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u201cThis is not going to go the way you think?\u201d Mark Hamill was trying to tell us all along. This movie will definitely divide Star Wars fans. Mainly because it introduces major changes into the franchise and our ideas of what is and isn\u2019t possible. I personally enjoyed being surprised by it and can\u2019t wait to see what more we have to learn of the force in Episode 9","true":true}
