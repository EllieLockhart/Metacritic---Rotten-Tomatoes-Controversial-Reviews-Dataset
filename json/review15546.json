Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved Rouge One and liked Force Awakens but TLJ was horrible\\, not just as a SW movie but an actual film\\, its bad.\\n\\nThis was as bad or actually worst than the prequels\\, I never walked out of a Starwars movie this angry and depressed at the same time.\\n\\nHell at first I wasn't keen on a Solo\\, Fett\\, Jabba movies but at this point any Starwars movies away from the Rey trilogy is a dream come true... bring it on. You can keep the new Rian Johnson trilogy as well. I like Looper\\, but I don't think I will be watching any of his future films.","true":true}
