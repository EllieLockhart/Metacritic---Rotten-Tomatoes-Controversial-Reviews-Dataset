Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed this...Who wants to see a film in which you know what's going to happen next? Lesson to all - NEVER take a Star Wars plot for granted. Still enough questions unanswered for a fantastic conclusion in the next film. BluRay already on pre-order and counting down until the next  film is released.","true":true}
