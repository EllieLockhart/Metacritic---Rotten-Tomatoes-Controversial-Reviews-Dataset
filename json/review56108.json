Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So sad.  I viewed this movie twice in the theater.  Visually\\, it was beautiful\\, and had some fun sequences\\, but as a Star Wars film\\, it was so weak.  J.J. set things up fairly well with The Force Awakens\\, only for Johnson to throw it all away to castrate the male characters\\, particularly Skywalker\\, while at the same time pushing these \\\"flawless\\\" female characters up to the fore to be politically correct.  Rey is the same clueless girl we got in the Force Awakens with little development to her character.  Finn had more development\\, willing to sacrifice himself for a cause he believes in\\, only to have some mechanic whose only purpose is to spout off some political message jump in and stop him.  Poe is shown to be a complete over the top hot head here\\, which isn't a bad idea in and of itself\\, but the entire idea of withholding the escape plan was just unnecessary.  Kylo still isn't an intimidating villain\\, and Snoke's death had no real weight to it.  And finally\\, Luke Skywalker's character was just...disappointing.  Mark Hamill delivered a good performance for what he had to work with\\, but considering murdering his own nephew after he had redeemed his father who had done countless terrible acts years before was just a joke.  Lucasfilm needs to be brought under better management.  They need a president who actually understands the franchise that is being worked on\\, rather than gearing everything toward targeting a demographic that was never really intended to be the sole focus of the series.  There were always strong female characters in the series and in the other related media.  Unless Lucasfilm changes management and gets a grip on things\\, you'd be better off enjoying the Lucas era Star Wars\\, and some of the books and comics from that period.","true":true}
