{"101487":183257,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is very heart wrenching to say this\\, about something I have beloved so dearly since a young child. Last Jedi is the absolute worst SW's movie in the history of the franchise. \\n\\nI don't even know where to begin. Everything from the bizarre\\, depressing portrayal of Luke Skywalker\\, to the uneventful backstory of both Snoke and Rey\\, the horrible plot lines\\, unimaginative storytelling\\, to the unsexy weird love triangle between Finn\\, Rey\\, and Rose. The comic relief was cringy at best\\, and anyone over the age of 25\\, could easily see a huge leftist political agenda being shoved down the throats of the audience.\\n\\nThe artwork and the special effects in TLJ\\, are nothing short of spectacularly beautiful. The action sequences are nothing short of thrillingly fantastic. Hats off to Rian Johnson and the art\/special effects team for delivering a visual masterpiece. \\n\\nWhat TLJ makes up for in art and action\\, it's lack of depth and emotion are about as shallow as the Gobi desert in mid summer. Sure the movie is a thrill ride\\, but there's no guys and glory. There's nothing fantastic\\, nothing magical and mysterious leading you up to the drop off\\, instead it just immediately drops off. \\n\\nIt would be the equivalent of going to an amusement park and the every ride you get on just immediately drops to second you sit down. There's no long pull upwards looking down at your possible impending doom\\, there's no looking around at the majestic world around you to get caught up in\\, as you begin to feel like a God climbing to the heavens above. There's no dragging you and any of the characters through the \\\"muck\\\". Therefore you don't get emotionally attached to any of the characters in TLJ\\, I never once felt despair or pain\\, or fear\\, or happiness and joy for anyone. \\n\\nInfact the only two emotions I could muster up the entire film\\, was anger and frustration at the writers\\, directors\\, and producers of this poorly crafted film. I guess you could say Rian Johnson really brought the \\\"Darkside\\\" out me. I'm not sure if that's a good thing\\, considering I had high hopes for this trilogy. \\n\\nMy 8 and 5 year old children could have told a better story. I could have written and produced a more emotionally in-depth movie\\, and I know countless of other Star Wars fans who could have did it even better than myself. Rian Johnson deserves the credit he gets\\, which is for making something pretty to look at. Everything else is just a travesty. I would advise anyone who is a long time SW's fan to save your hard earned dollars if you don't want to see your dreams shot down in flames. Which brings me to another point.\\n\\nI understand they want to do away with the old and bring about the new\\, and I'm perfectly fine with that as long as it's done the correct way. However\\, it wasn't done the correct and honest way. It was done as a quick cash grab\\, which is aggravating. There was no homage paid to Luke\\, or any of the old heroes. Where was the lightsaber battle for Luke? What the heck happened to his hope? You can't get me to believe? that Kylo Ren\\, who at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul\\, could turn the most hopeful Jedi in the galaxy\\, into a despaired hopeless hermit. You're talking about the guy you turned one of the most powerful and evil sith lord\\, back to the light side. \\n\\nI didn't have a problem with the astral projection tie in with the force. I thought it was a cool idea\\, yet it was poorly executed. I also have a problem with Rey and her unmatched skills. You're telling me that an amateur at best\\, beats Kylo Ren? Which is why I can't take Kylo Ren serious\\, and why I say he's at best a lesser powerful Darth Maul. You also make her best\\, Luke??? Why don't you just go ahead and hand her the victory on a silver platter\\, and hand Kylo Ren a trophy for participation... Rey is like a Jedi God\\, she can do no wrong\\, she has no trouble but only triumph. I want to see her suffer\\, so I can feel for her character\\, I want to love Rey as a hero. I want to go through her pain and tragedy\\, and her joy and victory. \\n\\nWhat was up with the casino scene? That whole gimmick was just a terrible time filler\\, which could have been used to show Luke training Rey! That whole casino scene was probably one of the worst scenes in the history of cinematography. Totally unnecessary\\, and boring.\\n\\nSnoke\\, where do you even start with this guy? Wow\\, what a let down. We wait two years and all we get is about 15 minutes of an old man in a golden bath robe\\, showing off extremely powerful skills only to be cut in half? Where's his backstory? Who the heck was he\\, and how did he rise to power after Vader and Sidious died? \\n\\nThere were so many really good angles they could have took when dealing with Snoke. What about the Darth Plagueis theory? What about the Jar Jar Binks sith Lord theory and tying in the prequels? What about the theory about Snoke being a master of both the light and dark? Why were all of these awesome theories\\, just brushed aside like nothing matters?\\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, had the potential to be the best SW's movie ever\\, it had the chance to the everything together\\, and it fell short due to whatever insane reasons Rian Johnson had in mind. The Star Wars franchise was a franchise\\, that seemed like it would be impossible to ever drop the ball with. However that's exactly what was done here. \\n\\nWhat's sad\\, is not only did Disney drop the ball\\, they might as well just destroyed the franchise. Maybe they're? looking to appeal to the younger generation\\, but they could have still done that and interwoven the old heroes in with the new\\, while eventually passing the torch.\\n\\nWhat Disney and Rian Johnson did to Star Wars\\, is borderline blasphemy.","true":true}
