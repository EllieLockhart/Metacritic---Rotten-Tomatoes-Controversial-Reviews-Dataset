Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If one day I will be forced to rewatch this movie again I will just pretend that it takes place between ep 3 and 4 and that the Resist..ehm..Rebellion is fighting against the Empire\\, with the support of a casual Jedi survived to the order 66 that chose to retire himself in an Island\\, and will pretend that this is not Luke Skywalker","true":true}
