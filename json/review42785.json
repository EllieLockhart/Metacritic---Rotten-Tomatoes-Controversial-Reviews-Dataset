Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was just plain bad and so many scenes did not make sense or were just bizarre. The most notable one is leia surviving in space for several minutes because reasons. It felt like a bad fan fiction and just made rey unlikable. It made the characters completely useless and it felt like finn's story made no sense and added characters that were completely useless. i think the formula was there just the director could not handle it.","true":true}
