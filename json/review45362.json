Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter pure trash...this is not a Star Wars movie. Everything about this movie is awful! Go google search anything to do with this movie and Mark Hamils opinion and it'll tell you everything you need to know. If you are a TRUE Star Wars fan\\, you'll hate it.","true":true}
