Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After this hot mess I am just pulling for the empire to crush the rebellion and end a once great franchise. TFA was a rehash of ANH and I was ok with that as I still found it enjoyable. This POS should have never been released. Disney=Judas Iscariot...they sold out star wars","true":true}
