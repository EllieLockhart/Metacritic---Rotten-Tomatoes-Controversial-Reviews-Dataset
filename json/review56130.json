Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever. I don't know what you liked about it\\, the inconsistency\\, the bad jokes\\, the forced femenism\\, the plot holes it left\\, the wasted opportunities of characters like snoke and phasma \\, the unnecessary casino scene\\, Benicio del Toro brought nothing\\, kylo ren's mood changes\\, Rey's \\\"Mary Sue\\\" character\\, no one on one lights saber duels\\, Leia's ridiculous flying scene\\, but most of all it absolutely destroyed Luke Skywalker's character making him this week pathetic washed up old man\\, he is the greatest and most powerful grand Master jedi ever\\, and it just threw that out the window. Absolutely disgusting. I hated it.","true":true}
