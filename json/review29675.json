Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson takes huge risks that pay off big time. The film stays true to the legacy of what came before it\\, while adding to the mythology and universe in new and interesting ways. Top notch performances all around. It mixes humour and heart well.","true":true}
