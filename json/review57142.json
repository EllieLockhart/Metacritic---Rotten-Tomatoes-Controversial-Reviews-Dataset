Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not going to go the way you think!\\nAnd that seems to be the issue with some vocal die hard fans\\, my advice is not to listen to them and go see for yourself. It's a great movie. Part Empire part ROTJ with echoes of Mad Max Fury road and raiders. I think after the anger has subsided everyone will enjoy this film with repeated viewings and it plays very well when watching back to back with TFA.\\nI can understand the issue with plotlines being discarded from TFA but this does not detract from the spectacle of TLJ","true":true}
