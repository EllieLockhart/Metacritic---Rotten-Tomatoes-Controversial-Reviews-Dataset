Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll give the movie 2 stars.  One for looking pretty and the other in sympathy for Adam Driver\\, who did much with very little and deserves better.\\nI hated this movie.  The story makes no sense\\, the characters are bland and disinteresting\\, The protagonist lacks a personality and any charisma.  I heartily wished Kylo had defeated the whole cast in the first act and moved onto more interesting things\\, like lawn maintenance.  Luke Skywalkers characterisation was a travesty and I'm not surprised to read the OT fans are outraged.  What did Disney think was going to happen?  I'm not seeing ep 9\\, I'm not boycotting anything I'd just rather not waste my time.","true":true}
