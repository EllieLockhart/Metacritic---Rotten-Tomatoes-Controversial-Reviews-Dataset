Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was excited for this movie. I thought it was going to bring light to the unanswered questions The Force Awakens brought. Instead it turned into a mess! So many great possible story arcs and instead Rian took the liberty to completely destroy what could have been a series better than the original.... and the sad part is there's no turning back.","true":true}
