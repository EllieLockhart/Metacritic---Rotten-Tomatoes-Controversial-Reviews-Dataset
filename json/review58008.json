Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it has some great moments\\, there are just as many bad jokes\\, pointless plot lines and unneeded new characters that take away precious screen time from the characters that matter. \\n\\n\\nAnyone that is truly familiar with the original trilogy\\, and is not willing to ignore the crimes against Luke\\, Han and Leias legacy\\, knows this newest movie failed our beloved characters and derailed this new Trilogy. \\n\\n\\nIt's clear that Rian Johnson and Lucasfilm had an agenda to kill off the old cast to make room for the new cast\\, even if its done in the most disgraceful\\, depressing ways. Disney used Han and Luke to sell these movies and then discarded them like trash.\\n\\n\\nLuke's death in this is completely unnecessary and makes his character a coward that abandoned everyone\\, willing only to jedi skype a final appearance\\, then dying for no real reason on the island he refused to leave. The former savior of the galaxy\\, now unredeemed\\, selfish\\, and actually the cause of Snoke and Kylos rise that lead to billions of people dying. Good job!\\n\\n\\nBut Rose and Finn saved cgi horses\\, and theres a Harry Potter wannabe stable boy. I guess it was \\\"all worth it\\\". \\n\\n\\nThis movie is a disgrace that craps all over Luke\\, half of what JJ setup in Ep7\\, and leaves very little to anticipate in Ep9.","true":true}
