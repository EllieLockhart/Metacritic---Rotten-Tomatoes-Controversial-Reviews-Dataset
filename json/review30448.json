Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Several issues with this one:\\n1. Too long by about 30 min.\\n2. Seemed to be including cute characters with an eye for merchandising\\, not extending the story\\n3. Not as \\\"adult\\\" as others in the franchise\\, seemed more focused on a more youthful audience and PG rating\\n4. Not a real cliff-hanger ending\\n5. A \\\"low on gas\\\" pursuit for an hour??? Then somehow a planet appears with just the right defenses\\, etc.????? Hokey\\n6. Luke character seemed split between haunted with evil (see his face when he almost does in the young Kylo Ren) and laughing at the whole Jedi thing\\, possibly his role in the movie","true":true}
