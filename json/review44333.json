Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes and the story unravels miserably when simply tugged at the seams.  This says nothing for the absolute travesty of transforming an icon of hope and good\\, spanning over 40 years\\, into a milk-drinking hack.  In dark theaters\\, lit by the light of this movie\\, is where childhoods go to die.","true":true}
