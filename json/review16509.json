Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must say. this is a big mess. I have been a star wars fan all my life as i was born in 72. hehe. So I can not stan behind this crap. The storytelling is realy bad. The logic of things is to magic. \\\"bombs in space\\\" He could have done this on a planet of some sort. and pulled it off. The Death of Fin witch would have made sens was gimped as well .. Well all climaxes of the movie are uterly BS.. The jedi part an no Laser swords WTF. Too bad to see that this is the shit the new young Directors are pulling out of there asses. Shame on you.","true":true}
