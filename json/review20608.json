Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've read a lot of negative reviews\\, and they all have something in common: everyone seems to think they could have written the story better themselves.\\n\\nFor one\\, I am grateful that the genius behind this story has surprised everyone. We don't know what to expect\\, and we still are left without a clue where the story will go from here.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was one of the best Star Wars movies hands down. The story is amazing\\, the creatures and characters really bring it home\\, and there's nothing more I could have asked for.","true":true}
