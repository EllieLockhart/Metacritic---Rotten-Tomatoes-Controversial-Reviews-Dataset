Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this movie is being review bombed for an unknown reason (maybe because it's racially diverse? or maybe everyone hates Disney?).\\nRegardless\\, this movie is significantly better than expected.\\nWhat I love about this Star Wars is that it's more than a reboot\\, it somehow manages to keep its strong emotional connection but is full of surprises. \\nToo often are \\\"bad guys\\\" just overly vilified as just pure evil with no reason and without showing their motivations. This movie helps to humanise Kylo Ren\\, which makes it far more relatable and understandable\\, overall making the movie far more impactful.\\nThe rebels also fail several times and things go a completely different direction to planned (e.g. wrong codebreaker\\, failed disabling of tracker\\, failure to prevent gate destroyer) which is refreshing to see\\, it means you can't constantly accurately predict what's going to happen and again makes it more relatable and it feels more real.\\nAnother is maintaining the emotional side and tribute to the originals\\, Luke & Leia reuniting is genuinely touching and Yoda coming back to help end the Jedi is very refreshing and provides closure on the old trilogy.\\nOverall\\, this is a really good movie and well worth a watch\\, ignore the review bombing\\, it's a great film!","true":true}
