Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We were doing so well with the last 2 Star Wars installments that we had to pause and make a prequel style cash grab flick.\\n\\nSPOILERS\\n\\nMark Hamill couldn't save this film just like how Luke couldn't save Kylo Ren.\\nHuge vegan\/animal rights messages side by side with product placement for the new cute toys that will infiltrate the holiday market. I dig the animal rights but the endless capitalism to make products by using poor comedic acts makes the film ever so cheap and tacky like a walmart knock of light saber that has no sound.\\nVisually it was beautiful. But God was never a facet of the star wars universe and the force isn't magic or some super power.\\nHow many plot lines can we have and not progress any of the characters? While we're at it\\, lets kill some off without any answer to who they were. Then let's fake you out in stupid thin plot twists.\\n\\nIn short\\, do yourself favor and watch the Christmas special.","true":true}
