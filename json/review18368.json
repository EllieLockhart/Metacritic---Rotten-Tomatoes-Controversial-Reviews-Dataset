Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought we were done with bad star wars movies\\, but The Last Jedi brings them back. This movie could have been saved in editing\\, but alas\\, we are left with Rian Johnson's attempt at injecting Marvel-like movie humor into the Star Wars Universe.\\nThe Star Wars movies have always had some humor\\, normally coming at the expense of R2-D2 or C3-PO. In the last Jedi we have poorly timed and tired jokes destroying the pacing of the film. Why would you derail a tense opening scene? Why would you trivialize the Epic moment when Rey hands Luke his lost light saber? What could have been a fantastic throne room duel comes off as a  choreographed dance\\, with even more contempt shown to the obviously more skilled guards by allowing them to be beaten. \\nAs with the previous movie\\, I avoided all spoilers and trailers\\, wanting to have no preformed opinion before seeing the movie itself. I saw the movie twice opening day (I did not pay for either viewing)\\, and upon the second watch my contempt for the movie continued to grow\\, as I groaned before what i new was about to happen on screen. \\nRian Johnson is the Jar Jar binks of The Last Jedi. thankfully he did not have any screen time\\, but his impact will be felt for as long as people watch this movie.","true":true}
