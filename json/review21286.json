Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie with high hopes and it blew them all away in the best way. The movie doesn't follow the standard star wars saga formula and it's all the better for it. There are a few beats that feel out of place but are still well executed and all the performances are stellar across the board. This film takes what we know about the lore and turns it on its head. To simply say it takes risks would be a disservice to the movie. The stage is set for an epic conclusion and further episodes should they choose\\, and I can't wait for more.","true":true}
