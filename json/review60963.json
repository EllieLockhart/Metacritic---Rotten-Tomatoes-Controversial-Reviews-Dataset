Simply idiotic and inconsistent.\r\rSo the story is resumed to a vengeance trope (because who would want to witness an interesting\\, gut-wrenching and beautiful story in a TLOU game?) against an uninteresting villain we are supposed to relate through brutal scenes. But that's it. There is nothing more being developed. At no point the director's promises are respected : no questioning redemption nor forgiveness\\, you just drag some characters to the next cutscene where someone gets butchered. No control or decision on actions\\, the player means nothing. So how are we supposed to think about redemption or forgiveness if none of our actions actually matter ?\r\rThe best decision to take is actually not to buy the game. Because\\, unfortunately\\, fake positive reviews from companies glorify this joke and will still convince some people to give it money.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
