Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When George Lucas was making Star War movies\\, all he wanted is to tell his story\\, when Disney makes Star War movies\\, all they want is to get that $4 billion back and make more.\\n\\nDisney doesn't have a story to tell\\, the whole movie is a mixture of subplots each serving a different marketing strategy. Nostalgia to sell tickets to fans\\, cute animals to sell toys\\, feminism to pander to the PC culture and meaningless jokes for schmucks.\\n\\nThe most disgraceful part is that Disney brings the old heroes back\\, only to make them old\\, fat\\, miserable and died in meanless ways. Disney has no respect for them\\, they're just there to sell tickets.\\n\\nThis is not a Star Wars movie but a Disney movie to lure Star Wars fans. Compare this movie to the originals is like comparing cola to wine\\, looks similar but tastes very differently. \\n\\nI'm done with this cash cow\\, Disney can sell tickets and movie products to those who claim they like this movie\\, I won't go to see another Disney Star Wars movie again.","true":true}
