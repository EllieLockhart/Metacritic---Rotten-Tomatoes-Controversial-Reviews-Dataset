{"101487":184606,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is conflicting for me. For starters\\, I laughed at all the jokes included\\, I found myself 'wowed' at the cinematic experience of several sequences and scenes... but there were so many story elements that just don't make sense or were weakly written\\, in my opinion. They lacked depth or just failed to achieve what could have been possible. \\n\\nHoldo's actions and failure to communicate with her subordinates were absolutely worthy of treason and the mutiny that followed. Even after her big reveal\\, I questioned why she didn't make it known in the first place. They just lost 2 important ships in the remainder of their fleet with no attempt to save the crews\\, or at least launch a counterattack in a similar fashion to Holdo's final act. Even after Holdo's sacrifice\\, I didn't find it a redeeming action based on all the confusion and losses suffered under her leadership. I was so annoyed with her decision-making that I was just glad she wouldn't be making a return in future films.\\n\\nHux and Kylo display incompetence time and time again\\, yet are somehow the leader's of The New Order? This regime seems destined to fail under their leadership even without the presence of a powerful adversary among the 'New Resistance'. Their characters inspire ZERO fear or confidence in their ability to lead or conquer anything in the same way that nearly every villain in past films has - Vader\\, Sidious\\, Dooku\\, Maul\\, Boba\\, Jango\\, Tarkin\\, Jabba\\, heck\\, even the changeling assassin seems more capable than these two despite its' minuscule role. Snoke was the only redeeming character that brought these elements\\, but now he's gone after such little impact. He had so much to offer in terms of how in the world anyone would overcome him. Kylo's betrayal isn't uncharacteristic of the Dark Side\\, but Snoke's send-off seems too trivial after seeing the power he seemingly possessed.\\n\\nWhy do the 'bad guys' continue to put so many resources into building astronomically sized ships\/assets after they've proven time and time again to be an absolute waste? On screen alone\\, they've now lost 3 death stars\\, 1 dreadnought\\, and a mega-class Star Destroyer\\, not to mention losses incurred that are mentioned in lore\/stories. Size alone no longer inspires fear. It is not daunting. These true feats of engineering are now completely irrelevant.\\n\\nHull breaches. HULL BREACHES! The vacuum of space sucks out everything within as we witnessed with the General. Soooooo... why are Phasma\\, Rose\\, Finn and everyone aboard this ship immune? That scene was an absolute treat to witness\\, but AGAIN I was left questioning aspects that you just showed me an hour before behaving differently. HOW DID LEIA PULL HER SPECIAL STUNT!? WHY IS NO ONE ADDRESSING THIS AFTERWARD!? \\n\\nLuke:\\\"How did you find me? I purposefully came to the most un-findable place possible!\\\"   .......There was a map bro. There was a fucking MAP. It was literally the most important fact in Episode VII to finding your ass. AND YOUR OLD DROID HAD THE MISSING PIECE! I really loved Luke's send-off scene and Yoda's involvement\\, but everything that happened between Luke and Rey simply didn't feel right. More questions.\\n\\nThere was SO much hype about Rey's past that when we finally learn the truth\\, this 'big reveal' is absolutely one of the biggest let downs for me due to the amount of emphasis put on it and the manner in which it came out. It carried no weight. It brought no substance. It brought Rey no sense of relief nor conflict in that moment. So in the end\\, why did it even matter?\\n\\nThe parallels of Crait to the battle on Hoth make me want to vomit. Geee\\, very original of you to make a new trilogy that duplicates so much of the originals. I can pop those in the Blu-ray player if I want that experience again\\, just saying. But to add to the stupidity of the waste that is Rose - as far as ANY of the 'speeder' pilots knew\\, the last remnants of the 'New Resistance' are now trapped within a fortified cave with no exit and facing destruction ONLY due to the presence of a single laser cannon approaching with New Order forces. So Rose takes it upon herself to plow into Finn (after traveling at lightspeed somehow to regain an immense amount of ground since all of the speeders were just shown in the prior scene bolting back for the door while Finn continued on course) and eliminate any possibility of destroying the cannon? For what? That weak-ass 'power of love' scene? I didn't grasp that emotion between these characters at any point prior\\, and kissing while the fort's door is being melted is certainly the worst timing imaginable to illicit a positive response from an audience. YOUR ENTIRE CAUSE IS NOW ABOUT TO BE WIPED FROM EXISTENCE THANKS TO YOUR ACTIONS ROSE! I wish Finn had left her in that speeder's cockpit to be crushed by an approaching Gorilla Walker. Rose and Holdo's actions did everything to ruin the resistance. I will forever hate both characters.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, the film is a treat for the eyes. Scenes are very well shot and it provides a lot of astounding moments. The story elements are where it simply falls far short of what I anticipated. Rogue One was a drastic rebound from The Force Awakens\\, so I thought Disney had figured out the right recipe for this 'secret sauce'. Please go back to the drawing board for the final chapter. After 2 movie let downs\\, and Electronic Arts sinking their ship... you're really losing my interest in what the future may bring.","true":true}
