Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I GREW UP WITH STAR WARS AND HAVE BEEN A FAN SINCE 1977. I LOVE THE OT\\, EVEN WITH IT NOT BEING PERFECT AND SOME CORNYNESS. THE PREQUEL TRILOGY FILMS WERE OKAY BUT I FELT REVENGE OF THE SITH DID A GREAT JOB. THE NEW TRILOGY THOUGH\\, WASN'T A BIG FAN OF FORCE AWAKENS BUT IT WAS OKAY. THE LAST JEDI IS A MESS. IT RUINS LUKE SKYWALKER AND RUINS THE SET UP FROM TFA. THE FILM ADDS THROW AWAY CHARACTERS AND ACTS LIKE TFA AND TLJ ARE TWO DIFFERENT FILMS WITH TLJ TOSSING AWAY PLOTLINES FROM ITS PREDECESSORS (BETTERS). THE CRITIC RATINGS ON THIS FILM IS ABYSMAL AND TRULY IS ABOUT PANDERING TO DISNEY.","true":true}
