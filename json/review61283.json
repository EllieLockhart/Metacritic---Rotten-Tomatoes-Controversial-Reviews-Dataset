The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I think the story didn't please everyone because everyone kinda wanted a happy ending or something that they would expect. On the contrary\\, even though the ending is sad and unbearable to the point I have nightmares\\, i totally love it. it made me think. which I think is good. The choices Ellie's choose to make were very characteristic to the human being. She couldn't free herself from the burden and the loss of her adoptive father. Obviously if you think ln a objective view\\, you would think her choice were dumb and that should have let it go\\, which I agree! But that's her story and we gotta understand that that is her point of view and that we can't just put our-self in the place of Ellie.\r\rRemember when Joel saved Ellie from the Hospital\\, you were all agreeing that killing a doctor for selfish purpose was ok. Abby seeked revenge\\, Ellie seeked revenge too. It's human. It's just retribution.\r\rOn another note\\, I think the staff really made a good work\\, such as the way they wanted the game to be played. Like the intro with Abby\\, then Ellie for the revenge\\, and then the 2nd part with Abby point of view\\, to finally with Ellie again.\r\rFinal note : 9\/10\\, love the story\u2026 Expand","true":true}
