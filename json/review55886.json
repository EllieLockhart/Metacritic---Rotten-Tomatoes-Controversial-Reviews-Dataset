Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really good movie\\, but with several flaws.  \\nThe biggest flaw is the run time\\, while I wouldn't say any part bored me\\, some of it could've been cut (like the entire Monaco planet stuff) to make a more cohesive movie.  Another thing that bothered me was that we don't get any background info on Snoke\\, he seems to be quite old and powerful\\, so where was he in the first 6 episodes? Also\\, some of the effects were poor\\, especially in the creature department. The other flaws are things that can't be discussed unless you've seen the movie.  \\nThere is a lot of good:  fantastic action scenes\\, good acting (in a Star Wars movie?!?)\\, some big laughs (actually\\, an early gag was almost too funny for a SW movie)\\, and some interesting interplay between characters.  \\nAs per usual\\, even though I spent more time complaining about it\\, I really did enjoy this.  I think it'll rank right below Return of the Jedi for me.","true":true}
