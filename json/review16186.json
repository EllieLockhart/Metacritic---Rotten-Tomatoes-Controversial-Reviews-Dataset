Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm gonna give it a middle score\\, because it was \\\"okay\\\".The first third of the movie was definitely worth just 1 star for its excessive use of jokes and far too light of a tone for a SW movie\\, but it got better as it progressed. My biggest gripes with this movie\\, however: No balls to let characters die where it seems right and fitting; missed out on some much better dark story lines and character deveoplemtn\\, instead opting for more neutral-grey and heroism.","true":true}
