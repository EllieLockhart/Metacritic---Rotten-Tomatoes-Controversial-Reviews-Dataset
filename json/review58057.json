Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie made.  The list of wrongs with this movie is endless... Adam Driver's performance and character are the only thing making this movie something other than a complete joke.  Rian Johnson absolutely failed with this installment.  A scattered aimless plot ( was there one? )\\, the ridiculous Mary Poppins Princess Leia moment\\, pointless characters ( Snoke\\, Rose )\\, obvious SJW and Feminist agenda ( ALL of the rebel leaders are women\\, and all of the male characters in the movie are either idiots\\, cowards or trigger happy imbeciles )\\, The corny lines that were supposed to be comedic just made the movie seem like a bad SNL skit\\, the terrible Yoda hologram\\, bombs that \\\"drop\\\" in space??\\, the list goes on and on.  Even Mark Hamill said that this was not the Luke Skywalker he knew.  The only people who like this movie are the type of people who like it JUST because it says Star Wars\\, or people who don't know anything about the previous installments.  The only upside of this movie is that now JarJar Binks is no longer the worst part of the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
