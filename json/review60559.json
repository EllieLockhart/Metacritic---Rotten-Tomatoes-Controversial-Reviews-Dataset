The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Look\\, ultimately I found this game to be disappointing. I know\\, the people that gave this game a 10\/10 are going to dog on me and other people like me. People can be disappointed with a product and leave a negative or mixed review\\, just because they are bringing up valid criticism towards your game does not mean they are trolls or crybabies\\, they are just looking at the game through a different critical eye than what you are. For me\\, the story was the biggest let down. The new characters for the most part didn't land with me\\, and the ones that did are killed off and quickly forgotten\\, like they never even existed. Leading up to this game there was false advertising on the content of the game and the story\\, and obviously there's going to be backlash from that. On top of that if you brag about how you intended for your game to be divisive i think you forfeit your right to complain about half your audience not liking your game. This game literally takes the \\\"revenge is bad\\\" storyline and beats you over the head with it over and over again. Gamers are smarter than that\\, we know \\\"revenge=bad\\\"....we didn't wait 7 years for that. Correction\\, revenge is bad unless you're Abby. Abby gets her revenge and in my eyes gets away with it. Ellie loses EVERYTHING. It is also blatantly obvious that they go out of their way to force you to like Abby (Hey\\, look at how Abby plays with dogs\\, wow such a great person!). Finally\\, Metacritic\\, if you are going to be deleting negative or mixed reviews on your website that are clean genuine reviews then please do likewise with the 10\/10 reviews that are either clearly copied\/pasted\\, or are clearly made by bots. Otherwise you are just aiding in the score of this game being artificially inflated. However\\, I don't think you will do anything\\, as we all know that is a one way street\\, they will delete only the fake\/suspect reviews that are negative (even just outright deleting legitimate negative reviews)\\, but they will leave the fake 10\/10 reviews alone. That is how it works. This game IS NOT a 10\/10. It is also not a 0\/10. Even though I believe this game is a 5\/10\\, realistically it is probably around a 6\/10 or a 7\/10\\, at its absolute highest 8\/10...but anymore than that and you're just pretending\\, I'm sorry.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
