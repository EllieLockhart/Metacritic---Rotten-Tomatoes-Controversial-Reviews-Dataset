Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost a good movie\\, but has too many annoying scenes that stop it getting there. Like a lot of people i didn't like the way they wrote luke's character in this movie\\, he really did deserve better. The carrie fisher mary poppins moment had the whole cinema groaning as well. Bit of a disappointment really.","true":true}
