Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was brilliant. Completely different from any of the the previous Star Wars movies. Leaves it completely open on what is going to happen next. Only reason is 4 stars is because there are some scenes that were just unnecessary and boring. Other than that all the key moments were unreal and breathtaking. ","true":true}
