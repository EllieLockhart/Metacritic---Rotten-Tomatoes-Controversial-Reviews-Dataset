Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was alot of fun\\, however there were few nitpicking plot points(that I won't go into for spoilers) that stood out as completely deflated from the previous movie... or just not that important. Other than that\\, this may contain one of the cooler lightsaber fights we have ever seen\\, and one truly jaw dropping moment of destruction. Go see it\\, it was awesome.","true":true}
