{"101487":175921,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi. With a title like that\\, it's no surprise that Star Wars Episode VIII was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The implications and perceived darkness of the title and trailers gave mega-fans like me more hype than we could handle\\, especially coming off the nostalgic and satisfying Force Awakens\\, which was a grand-slam commercially\\, critically\\, and most importantly: with the fans. I bought my tickets at first release\\, wore my favorite Star Wars shirt\\, and arrived at the theater expecting great things and to be blown away again.. but I can't believe I'm saying this: I left The Last Jedi disappointed & feeling like I got swindled by an old friend in trailers & marketing.\\n\\nNow\\, to say that I hated The Last Jedi would be a big overstatement. The movie does many things extremely well. For one\\, the visuals are crisp and the cinematography is fantastic. Indeed\\, it is definitely a beautiful film to look at & technically sound one as well\\, with diverse location settings everywhere from breathtaking green rocky Irish mountaintops to underused yet fascinating Utah white and red salt fields. The visual effects in things like Rey's flashbacks and visions as well as the lightsaber fights are great too\\, as should be expected with that kind of budget and today's tech but still a plus.\\n\\nFollowing\\, the action. TLJ (The Last Jedi) certainly delivers on action\\, with thrilling sequences in things like all of the lightsaber fights\\, the starship chases in the beginning and end\\, and even the all-out war scene in the final act. There are surprises too that will keep your heart pounding (although I have problems with some of them as I'll explain later)\\, but the film is definitely not boring and worth watching for sheer popcorn value.\\n\\nNext\\, the characters. The acting is very good as the cast does wonders with the admittedly problematic script they're given. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are by far the MVPs here and deliver fantastic\\, layered performances that add a LOT of depth to their characters and explore their backstories and psyches\\, with John Boyega doing well too in his subplot. TLJ also introduces a lot of new characters\\, some of them intriguing like Benicio del Toro's morally gray DJ\\, Captain Phasma\\, and Snoke as he's further revealed\\, but all of them very diverse in background and ethnicity\\, something as an Asian man who grows tired of seeing all white people in every movie\\, I can especially appreciate.\\n\\nAlso\\, Luke is back and brings a tremendous sense of nostalgia and as-expected great\u00a0 performance\\, even though his actions and the decisions written for him are problematic and something I do not agree with (as he did not either apparently according to reports). His story arc with Rey on the mountaintop is by far the most enthralling and where the film feels most at home exploring. It's a shame it feels undercooked as they spend a lot of time weirdly focusing on subplots like Finn and Rose (a character I didn't exactly love and felt forced to give Finn something to do) and the whole ship thing which didn't make much sense at all instead. This left many people in the audience head-scratching as they could've made a much more powerful movie further exploring Luke\\, Rey\\, & Kylo's arc.\\n\\nNow\\, the flaws\\, and I'm ashamed to say there are a lot of them. First and foremost: Disney-fication. I have been calling this out since the summer and how much Marvel films have changed since their Disney deal in movies like Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok\\, where it feels like Disney is trying to skew the movies towards weak-minded kids who want silly jokes and fuzzy creatures forced in every 5 seconds to lighten up and kidify the films\\, making them devoid of any wit\\, seriousness\\, or consequences previously artful films could've had. That seriously hindered my experience of Ragnarok & Homecoming\\, but the SAME problem blleds over to TLJ here\\, even more brutal as things like Porgs (the new Jar Jar Binks as far as I'm concerned..) \\, burping dwarves\\, Luke cracking jokes\\, and alien maids in nun outfits are shoved down our throats\\, when the film was marketed as being dark & serious like Empire Strikes Back and is essentially a big lie on that front and insult to Star Wars fans who trusted it.\\n\\nNext\\, the script is a mess. I found myself thinking at several points in the film 'Wait\\, this doesn't make sense. No problem\\, they'll fix it in the end'\u00a0but they never did. First\\, the entire Finn and Rose subplot is completely useless and does absolutely nothing to progress the story in any way. It feels like they just wanted to give Finn something to do & fit in an Asian character to appeal to that marketplace's $$$ (even more insulting). Also\\, the plot on the ship made NO sense. If Captain Phasma had just explained her thinking to Poe instead of leaving it muddy for dramatic effect\\, all would've turned out better for the Rebels instead of the disaster it did. Finally\\, I don't think the filmmakers understand how space works (crazy to ponder as it's called STAR Wars) as Leia had the perfect opportunity to have a meaningful (and well-needed after her tragic passing in real life) exit\\, but somehow survives being in DEAD SPACE without even a suit and swims to safety like nothing happened when science says she would've died instantly. Wow.\\n\\nFinally\\, accuracy to the Star Wars name and vision George Lucas built over 40 years. The film feels almost like a parody and betrayal of the character of Luke and the Jedi. I have to wonder if Rian Johnson even watched the original trilogy because of how different Luke is as a person\\, COMPLETELY flip-flopped in every way from his ideologies since we last saw him. Like I could accept that isolation can change a person\\, but his explanation and reasoning made no sense and were so poorly written it pissed me off: I sensed a little darkness in my student so I'm going to kill him and all Jedi I spent an entire trilogy begging to be part of!!!! Also\\, why did Yoda come back and say Jedi need to die and go along with his reasoning (which at least would've made for a more intriguing storyline if the movie had stuck with it and ended the Jedi and tried something different)\\, but at the end of the movie\\, we are in the EXACT same position narratively as when we started: The Rebellion is scrambling to survive as they're being hunted down by the First Order. The only difference is *SPOILER* Luke's exit\\, but even that lacked the true gravity and emotion that we should 100% expect from the exit of MAIN CHARACTER OF STAR WARS.\\n\\nIn the end\\, (I still can't believe I'm saying this for one of my most hyped films of the year) I left The Last Jedi disappointed and like I got let down by an old friend. The title\\, marketing\\, trailer\\, and \\\"critics\\\" all lied to me (Rotten Tomatoes is 100% paid off by Disney to give every one of their major releases 90%+ reviews\\, even when fans hate it and give 40% less (unseen in any major blockbuster). I will never see TLJ again and do not plan on seeing Ep. IX either. Thanks a lot Disney for ruining Star Wars.","true":true}
