Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Would give negative stars if I could. I don't even know where to begin. I think the saddest part is seeing this new generation of idiots thinking that somehow this is even a decent movie. \\n\\nJust a disaster from beginning to end. I still can't contemplate how Rian Johnson could have mucked things up that much. Just look at Mark Hamill's post premiere face. His expression pretty much sums up how true fans feel and the atrocity we just witnessed at the movies.","true":true}
