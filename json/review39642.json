Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This\\, in my opinion\\, is the BEST movie ever made! I was nervous about it at first before I saw it. But now\\, as I type this review\\, I am proud of what Rian Johnson and Disney did. The Force Awakens disappointed me. This movie didn't. The plot was excellent. The action\\, the dialogue\\, the intensity of everything\\, it was incredible!! I wish I could give this movie 6 out of 5 stars because it deserves it!!","true":true}
