Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie. And on several levels I do\\, I have to say the first two acts are actually quite exceptional. Mark Hamill delivers a stunning performance as Master Luke Skywalker\\, but I do have to agree with his earlier statements  which as he fundamentally disagreed with the direction they took him. That being said the third act really suffered in this movie. A lot of the threads they set up for in the force awakens were not even resolved but just tossed out the window. Several new and intriguing characters were just abandoned\\, leaving me at least feeling quite disappointed. The resolution of the film felt unnecessary and a bit sloppy. I really wanted to like this movie and on some level I do\\, but at the same time it doesn't resonate well with me and has a poor aftertaste.","true":true}
