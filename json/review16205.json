Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I might be in the minority here but I thought the dark side was way cooler in this movie. Maybe the Jedi should stop trying to train students because they always seem to go to the dark side? This movie is good fun and gives fans exactly what they\u2019re hoping for. ","true":true}
