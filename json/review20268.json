Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was so bad\\, from the sequencing to the plot. Tried my best not to fall asleep all throughout the movie. I am perplexed how this movie stands with a 91% rating. It's not just a bad Star Wars movie. It's a bad movie.","true":true}
