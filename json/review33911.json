Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible script\\, pacing\\, forced humour....For everything that TFA lacked in originality\\, The Last Jedi lacked in just basic film making. \\n\\nFeels like the result of a movie that was written more in a board room than in the director's mind.\\n\\nOnly real focus seems to be creating merchandising opportunities.","true":true}
