Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I was mind blown after watching it. I couldn't take it all in. When I was leaving the theater\\, I wanted to watch it five more times. I've been a Star Wars fan for years\\, and not because I was raised to loved Star Wars\\, in fact no one in family\\, or my close friends were huge Star Wars fans. I on my own decided to watch Star Wars and that started what would become my intense passion for Star Wars. I have watched every SW movie that's come out. I'll be honest\\, I was extremely excited for The Last Jedi\\, but I had become slightly jaded once the premiere came. Once I started watching it\\, the jadedness went away and I was left with pure emotion. During the film\\, I almost cried\\, I laughed a lot\\, I was upset and joyful and full of suspense and in shock.  I had so many feelings\\, I couldn't take it all in!! It was so ingenious and well written. The acting was phenomenal and story was wonderful. I never wanted it to end. I can not wait to watch it again.","true":true}
