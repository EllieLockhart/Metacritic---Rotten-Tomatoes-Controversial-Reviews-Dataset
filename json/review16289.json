Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not interested in watching a social justice commentary in Star Wars\\, bashing capitalism\\, and furthering the environmentalists mothering of animals. I want an epic story that taps into ancient truth\\, just as 4\\, 5\\, and 6 did. This was not a movie about truth and the heros adventure. This was a movie about\\, as Thomas Sowell puts it\\, the Vision of the Anointed. It's Communistic in it's philosophy\\, asserting non-timeless ideals of identity politics. This movie is a statement about the moral hierarchy of victimization\\, Marxism in disguise\\, oppressor against victim\\, capitalist against labor\\, instead of the timeless ideal of good battling evil. This movie isn't about good vs evil. It's about young vs old\\, progressive-ism vs conservatism. It's not story-telling. It's caricatures representing ideas\\, instead of people in a battle with their own inner demons\\, and conquering the evil without. It's not the hero's journey. It's the victims' perception of the universe. This movie can go to hell.?","true":true}
