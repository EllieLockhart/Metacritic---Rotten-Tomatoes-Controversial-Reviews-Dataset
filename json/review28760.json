Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite frankly\\, all of us had very high hopes for this movie\\, thinking that it would be the ESB of the sequel trilogy. Clearly\\, it wasn't. Many unecessary deaths were introduced\\, with a sh*t ton of plot holes. I mean\\, this movie was SUPPOSED to answer TFA questions\\, but not\\, it created even more uncessary ones. Rian Johnson f*cked the saga up way beyond repair with this movie. I won't lie\\, I enjoyed various scenes\\, but they were not enough to redeem the crappy movie itself. Yes\\, we need to get used to changes\\, but GOOD changes\\, not the real bad ones like this movie did. I just hope JJ may somehow clean up this humongous mess Rian did. JJ\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
