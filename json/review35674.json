Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is another great Star Wars movie. Don't listen to the fan boys\\, this movie goes to places no Star Wars movie has gone\\, great acting\\, cinematography\\, directing\\, editing\\, etc. I only have one problem\\, it's an small scene with a lead character that does something that's seems not very \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, but all the rest works.","true":true}
