Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"There is so much to say about this game. I absolutely loved this game! No matter what the detractors say because they love Joel and Ellie so much\\, everyone has to admit that the storyline was good because it made you feel some kind of way when situations happened to the characters and THAT is what makes the game good! At first I was rooting for Ellie and Joel and when it cane time to play as Abby I literally was thinking to myself \u201cwell screw her! I\u2019m just gonna play her and do the minimum!\u201d. I couldn\u2019t stand her at first\\, but then I started seeing all that she had gone through in the game\\, why she did the things she did and started realizing\\, hey she does have a heart and NO she didn\u2019t kill Joel for no apparent reason whatsoever! The only scientist\/doctor (that anyone was aware of) that could potentially create a vaccine and save humanity is dead because of Joel! I don\u2019t think people really let that sink in because they want to marry Joel and Ellie so bad. The characters Joel and Ellie were good people in their own way\\, but Abby was good in her own way as well. It just takes seeing things from another person\u2019s shoes rather than your own selfish viewpoint just because Joel was killed. There wouldn\u2019t be a story if everyone lived. There wouldn\u2019t be dialogue between people about the game either. What would there be? Bigger monsters and tiptoeing through the tulips? Come on people! Abby was after the cause of her pain and sorrow. She didn\u2019t want anybody dead but him\\, she could have killed Ellie as well\\, but she didn\u2019t because Ellie wasn\u2019t the source of her distress. It was Joel. No one can tell me they would have done things differently if they were in her shoes! Most people would\u2019ve prolly killed Ellie too\\, but Abby showed her humanity and it\u2019s wild to me how people didn\u2019t see it! The last fight was brutal and over the top and it showed me that Ellie was kind of crazed during the fight. Abby only fought Ellie to save this teenage boys life. She didn\u2019t even want to do it! Ellie didn\u2019t give two licks. Her humanity was nearly gone. She didn\u2019t care what was going on around her\\, she only saw one thing and that was to see Abby dead. In the end people really need to play the game in its entirety\\, PROCESS what happened (if they can\u2019t while playing) and then write a review. Don\u2019t write a review based on love for characters in the last game. Don\u2019t write a review when you haven\u2019t completed the game or based off leaks. I\u2019m only saying this because I know someone who has an opinion opposite mine that hasn\u2019t played the game and thank goodness they didn\u2019t write a review just because of things they seen in leaks and reviews from people who haven\u2019t played.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
