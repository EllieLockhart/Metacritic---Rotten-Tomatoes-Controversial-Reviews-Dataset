Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, just awful. I'm not a Star Wars super fan obsessed with the old movies\\, and I came in wanting to love this. This movie is just Disney being Disney with a bloated budget\\, one liner jokes being fired at random that destroy any sense of realism\\, and a plot that sounds like it was fished from a random word generator. There are only two reasons to slightly like this film. 1) It looks amazing\\, but so does every movie with a big budget and this film had the biggest. 2) Diversity. Yeah diversity is great but if you really want diversity you would want diverse actors playing GOOD CHARACTERS AND NOT JUST BEING PLUGGED RANDOMLY TO FILL A QUOTA. People will praise disney for being diverse but sadly I feel this has just become Disney's latest marketing scheme to suck in young viewers. If Disney cared at all they would have made a good movie with good character rolls to be filled and not a black whole of compressed trash built to suck in the money of anyone with an inkling of curiosity.\\n\\nTLDR: 1)Shit plot even the actors themselves couldn't take seriously (seriously look at Mark Hamill's interviews.) 2) Disney must be stopped before they hunt down and suck the life out of every beloved series in existence like some kind of ridiculous money vampire.","true":true}
