Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel people are being extremely unfair with this movie. \\nThis was a great Star Wars film. The hardest scene to take in might be the Leai scene where she uses the force to save herself. But this is the same Leai who feels Luke's need for her in ESB and that he was still alive in RotJ and feels Han Solo die from across the galaxy\\, so her using the force in this manner isn't so far fetched. I think the final saber fight was so badassly samurai like\\, like the duel between obi wan and mail in rebels. And that's the best. Sure the prequels(which no one liked for over a decade) had all those flashy lightsaber battles\\, but we got that with Snokes Guards!!! People need to realize that new is good. But if you can fail to see the force being reborn into it's spiritual roots rather than fricken midoclorian garbage than I feel bad for you. Embrace change\\, that's the will of the force.","true":true}
