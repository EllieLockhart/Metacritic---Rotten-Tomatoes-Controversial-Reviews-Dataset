Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi takes inspiration from previous movies within the franchise\\, however adds it's own unique spin onto it. The movie introduces a few new elements\\, some that work and some that don't such as a certain thing which is too strange and impossible to explain how a perticular force power was even possible. The over use and obsession of wildlife within the movie was fun at first however became too common.                                                                               The visuals within the last Jedi are likely the best they have ever been within a Star Wars movie\\, this can be seen in the ships and transports that this movie brings along such as in the new AT-M8's and snokes flag ship.                                         The characters them self also take an interesting turn of events with you thinking that they may take or do one thing and then the opposite happening. However some roots in which certain characters go you would never believe them to take that root. The acting is top notch with an improvement in acting style from lead daisy ridley (Rey) and a more fleshed out Po Damarom\\, who was not seen enough in the force awakens.                                                                   In conclusion I really enjoyed this movie despite the floors\\, and would recommend to not judge it by what other people and communities are saying\\, but by your own opinion .","true":true}
