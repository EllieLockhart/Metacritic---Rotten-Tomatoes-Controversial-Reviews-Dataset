Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't even begin to sum up everything wrong with this movie. It is far and away the worst movie since the Phantom Menace\\, and it MAY be worse. I literally never bother to review movies\\, but this trash was so bad I just had to add my 2 cents to the pile. \\n\\nTo put this into context\\, I'm a lifelong StarWars fan. I adored Rogue One. The only StarWars movie better than Rogue One is Empire\\, but that's a given of course.\\n\\nHalf of The Last Jedi is uninspiring drivel either on a little island or on some stupid ship. The characters do a bunch of nothing which leads to more nothing. There's a ton of CGI animals thrown in to try and make you forget nothing is happening. After the nothing\\, there is almost a light-saber fight that is almost interesting and character building\\, but then it becomes more nothing. The movie ends with some kid holding a mop. It's suppose to be deep\\, but it's really more nothing. \\n\\nIf you're a fan of StarWars\\, skip this. If you're a fan of good writing\\, character building\\, characters with agency... really if you're a fan of things that are good\\, skip this.","true":true}
