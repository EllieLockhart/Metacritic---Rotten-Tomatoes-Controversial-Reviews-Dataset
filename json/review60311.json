Despite what some people have said\\, the characters are excellently written and all have depth. The gameplay is action packed and tense\\, similar to that of the first game but amplifies and tightened at the screws.There\u2019s a lot to say about this game.

The gameplay is action packed and tense\\, similar to that of the first game but amplifies and tightened at the screws. The game can pan out without a single bug or jitter of the Ps4 console\\, this is surprising as the game is massive! At times it feels like an open world game\\, even though it\u2019s not supposed to be! The game is about 20-30 hours depending on how much you decide to explore. And NO the game is not too long\\, it\u2019s a game for gods sake. When have people ever complained about a game being too long? In summary\\, The Last Of Us Part 2 while being controversial and brave\\, is the culmination of years of passionate development and a spectacle of what the Ps4 can accomplish and what we can hope to expect from future games! Definitely worth the money\\, even if the story is too complex for you or you don\u2019t like it\\, it\u2019s worth playing until the end and experiencing a game that shines with the very passion its creators have put into it!!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
