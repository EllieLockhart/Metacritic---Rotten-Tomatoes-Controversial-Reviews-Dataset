Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leia flies like Superman through space\\, Luke milks a space walrus and dies alone after abandoning his friends and trying to kill his own nephew\\, and Yoda laughs while burning sacred Jedi shit with force lightning.\\n\\nIt was beautifully made though\\, competently shot with some pretty killer production design in places.","true":true}
