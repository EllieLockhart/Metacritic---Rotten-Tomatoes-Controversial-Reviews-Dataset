We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As you guys might be able to check my profile I only write reviews when I feel strongly about a game\\, and in this case I do.\r\rI was anticipating this game greatly\\, however as trailers came out and later videos discussed the relationship of Cckman and sarkasien(however it is spelled) and their agenda made me wary. Then the spoilers came\\, then the lockings and bannings\\, eventually the game is out and we all see that the leaks were true. The disgusting nature of the writing and story is something that most people find repulsive\\, as the current 20000 positive to 40000 negative reviews show as well.(At the time of my writing\\, it took this **** website nearly 2 months ALLOWING me to post a negative review on this crap)\r\rSince the shills are out in numbers\\, and are giving 10s it is only fair that this game gets 0s too in response. My actual score would be about 3\\, it is an extremely boring and tedious game with hardly any action and way too much downtime. I wouldn't recommend it. It simply pales in comparison to the first game\\, and compared to that it is indeed a 3 at best. Cckman got everyone fired\\, Naughty Dog is not what it was in the ps3 era. And it will only get worse as time goes by and we enter the ps5 era.\r\rGet the heck out of here with your SJW(communist) agenda\\, cultural revolution and eventual genocide.\r\rI got the game used from a friend that got it early\\, if you must get it\\, buy it used if you care for the future of\u00a0gaming!!!! Don't give any corporation money for this brainwashing bs.\r\rAs a final note: professional reviewers have been a joke for years\\, and that is only getting worse as well.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
