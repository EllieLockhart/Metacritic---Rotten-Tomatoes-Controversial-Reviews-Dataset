Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complicated\\, with turns that are both unpredictable and seemingly dismissive of the work done in the force awakens.  At the same time it is fun\\, technically excellent\\, and worth repeat viewings.  Judging the second act of the trilogy without the third will mean many choices are not going to be fully understood\\, but I for one am very interested to see where we go from here.","true":true}
