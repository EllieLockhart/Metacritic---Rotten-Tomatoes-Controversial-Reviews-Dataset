Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"way too many plot holes and a total disregard for all the set ups that JJ Abrams implemented in VII. This movie is like a child took over a story without caring about what came before it and just made up a store off the top of his head. Ryan Johnson just wanted to make his own movie and wasn't focused on making the middle movie to a trilogy.","true":true}
