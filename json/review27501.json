Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall had some visually stunning scenes and a plot I enjoyed\\, but it has some pacing issues and a lot of things it could've done better. Still very much worth seeing for the main plotline.","true":true}
