Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is inconsistent with the story line from The Force Awakens\\, which set up a number of story arcs that are simply dumped in The Last Jedi.  Everything the audience was looking forward to being explained at the end of the Force Awakens is brushed off.  Main characters are killed off in boring and meaningless ways\\, new characters have all the charisma of dead slugs.  If there is an actual story line to the movie it's not apparent in the film.  I would rather rewatch the Star Wars Christmas Special than sit through TLJ again.","true":true}
