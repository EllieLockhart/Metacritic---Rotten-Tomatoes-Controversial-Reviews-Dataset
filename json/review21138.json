Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thoroughly disappointed with what they did to Luke Skywalkers legacy in this film. Luke was willing to die for Vader\\, but in this film he was willing to murder a child in their sleep? It doesn't make sense. My pet peeves also include \\\"Laser Sword\\\" and WWII style bombers in space. And seriously how did the bombs fall if there is no gravity in space. I'm a Star Wars fan through and through\\, but that was ridiculous.","true":true}
