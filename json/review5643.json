Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didnt like it but can work with in regards to the Star Wars universe. Im giving it 1\/2 star. The reasoning behind it is because of Disney force feading that the movie was a great movie when over 1\/2 the fans disagree. Instead of looking and seeing what they could do better they just tell you as a fan for almost 30 years that you just dont get star wars.","true":true}
