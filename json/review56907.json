Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"These are not the Red Herrings you are looking for...\\\"\\n\\nI gotta say. I'm actually fairly disappointed by The Last Jedi. There were a LOT of awesome scenes in the movie - some of which are non-sensical in the context of pre-established lore - and overall\\, it has a lot of good. But the massive hype in the ad campaign for the movie\\, the completely illogical choices for several of the main characters (this was my absolute main gripe with the movie; a brilliant arc was set up in TFA just to be completely discarded and thrown to the wayside... hell it was even built up IN THE LAST JEDI\\, up until the point where they completely disregard it)\\, and an overall unfulfilling ending\\, that\\, just makes me want to watch older and better Star Wars movies to fill the void this movie just didn't fill on it's own...\\n\\nThe worst part? Knowing the choices that were made for this movie and that potentially masterpiece-tier plot arc that was discarded\\, I really don't want to see the 9th installment\\, nor am I excited for Rian Johnson's \\\"new trilogy.\\\" Here's hoping the Han Solo movie\\, and rumored Ben Kenobi movie are good in their own right.\\n\\n2.5 out of 5.","true":true}
