Based on what we got on TLOU 1 the bar was set very high.  Part 2 not only didn't meet that bar but plainly failed in multiple levels throughout the 22 hours I played the game.  Never before have I purposely wanted my character to be defeated in a game but that was my reality in one of the ending fight scenes.

The gameplay\\, graphics\\, scenery\\, and scare factor are all top notch and deserve acclaim.  The plot and storyline is equally poor however.  A very sour ending to what should've been a great series extender.   Definitely play this game if you have not played or have no interest in part 1.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
