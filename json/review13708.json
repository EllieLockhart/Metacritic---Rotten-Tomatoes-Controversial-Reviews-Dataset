Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find it really questionable that the critics liked it so much\\, it was awful\\, not only from a star wars fans perspective\\, but also a movie fanatic. i support woman empowerment and cultural diversity\\, but to shove it in so BLATANTLY is TERRIBLE.","true":true}
