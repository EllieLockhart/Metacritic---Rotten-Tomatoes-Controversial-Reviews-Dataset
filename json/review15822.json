Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars\\, but this movie just makes no sense. It is so full of plot holes that the Star Wars faithful (myself included) are in complete turmoil. There is no rational explanation for the story. We don't understand much of what happened and how it came about. \\n\\nThis turmoil has been blamed on sexism due to the many female lead roles\\, but that accusation is a distraction. Using men in the roles wouldn't have fixed the real problem -- the numerous plot failures. \\n\\nAs the movie ends in complete tragedy\\, all the good guys still alive have smiles on their faces in complete denial of how badly they failed. Disney lives in the same mode. They made a Star Wars movie and they're wearing smiles\\, but they are also in denial of the movie's many failures.","true":true}
