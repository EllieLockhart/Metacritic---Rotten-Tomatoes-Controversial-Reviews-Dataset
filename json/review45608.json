Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. The movie tosses out most of the interesting new ideas from The Force Awakens abs spends way too long jerking you from one plot twist to the next. The movie reaches a clear and obvious end point\\, then continues on for another half hour. Several scenes are glaringly nonsensical and clearly exist only because someone thought the visual would look cool. Most of the subplots are either contrived or pointless or both. The silly humor that's repeatedly shoehorned is overbroad and often contrasts harshly with the serious tone of adjacent scenes. The ending lands with a dull thud that leaves me totally unenthused for the next film. ","true":true}
