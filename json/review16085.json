Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm another person who has signed up just to voice my utter disappointment in this film. I'm still in shock that I've walked out from an expensive trip to the cinema feeling as if I wasted 3 hours of my life. Luke's character is shameful. I can understand the franchise's desire to address things such as the terrosim parallels and the failier of the Jedi\\, but they did not need to make it such a depressing unrelenting death fest. The relationships through the whole film were just muddy and nothing was resolved. I'm all for feminism and enjoy watching strong female leads but does this mean we are not allowed any character development or relationships? We go to the cinema to escape reality and there was a reassuring beauty in the older films of the good vs evil but this film was just like spending 3 hours trapped inside the head of a disillusioned and depressed middle aged man.","true":true}
