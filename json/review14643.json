Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have just registered onto this site to say what a steaming pile of sh\u00d7t this film was. I'm an avid SW fan and have posters up in my man cave to prove it. This film was so awful that I left the cinema after about 30 minutes as it felt like all the previous films have now been disregarded. The acting was laughable\\, the jokes were terrible and watching Luke milk an alien cow and Leia regain consciousness in space and fly back to her ship were just too much for me. This franchise is now tv or a download at best.","true":true}
