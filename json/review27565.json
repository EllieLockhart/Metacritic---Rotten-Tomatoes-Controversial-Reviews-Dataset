Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall the movie is great.The effects are amazing\\, all the shots are just beautiful\\, and the film was made great. But\\, as a star wars movie it came in well under my expectations. I was disappointed by what was included in the film and how Rian Johnson did or didnt answer many of the questions that J.J had left wide open to build off of. Dont get me wrong Rian did tell an amazing unexpected story but there were many thing that could have been taken down different paths. Hopefully episode IX will live up to the expectations that I had for The Last Jedi.","true":true}
