{"101487":169612,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAAAAAAAR WAAAAAAAAAARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Need I say more?\\n\\nSTAR WARS episode VIII: The Last Jedi.\\n\\nI'm not gonna lie\\, at a little over 2 hours\\, the film is mostly a slow crawl capped with action at the beginning & end. But the character development & story building makes the slight tedium worth it. Once again\\, there are shades of the OT spread throughout the film\\, but this time\\, they're subtle\\, so it's not an out & out remake. So many characters go through a noticeable arch\\, & while some threads come to an end\\, new ones are woven before our eyes.\\n\\nOnce again\\, the cast brings it home\\, & helps you remember why you love this franchise so much! Let's start with everyone's favorite scavenger; Rey spends much of this film as Luke did in ep 5\\, learning & growing\\, & sadly coming to grips with stuff she never wanted to confront. We see a more visible struggle between light & dark within her; she wants to be good\\, but it's hard at times to see which side is actually so. Chewie was there\\, supporting Rey\\, & that's pretty much it for him here. Ren is pretty one note this time around\\, he tries to be this soulless machine of the Order\\, but he's clearly losing it\\, the answers are right in front of him\\, but he's too blind & stupid to get it! He really is a tragic figure\\, a master of nothing but self destruction. Finn & Poe really seem to follow the same path this time around. They start out really headstrong & single minded\\, but they realize that\\, like in ep 4\\, there are alternative strategies. Leia really gets to show her strength both as a leader\/mentor\\, & in the force. We get to see her at her best\\, & worst\\, we see why she still commands respect\\, (R.I.P Carrie Fisher). Laura Dern's character surprised me\\, I can't say how\\, but I can say it was genuine. Snoke is...a bit of a disappointment this time around. He felt sinister & intimidating in ep 7\\, like the Emperor returned\\, but this time\\, he was...cantankerous\\, like he just escaped from the old folks home\\, not very threatening\\, also he wasn't actually scarred\\, he was misshapen\\, like he was born with that head; it brought up more questions\\, there was one improvement to him though\\, his look; he didn't look like CGI\\, he looked like a person in practical makeup\\, it was very impressive. Hux & Phasma were....there. Yeah\\, sadly\\, that was pretty much it for them. Hux spent the film as Ren's punching bag\\, & Phasma had 5 minuets of screen time at most! Hopefully\\, they'll get the end cap they deserve in ep 9. And now\\, we come to the old master; Luke. Was. Broken. That's all I can say here. With all he's seen & done\\, he was like a veteran with the worst case of PTSD & war weariness ever seen. He can't stop blaming himself for making the same mistakes as the Jedi of old. He took one look at Rey\\, & saw the same cycle of darkness consuming light that led to Ren. He's old\\, & tired\\, so...very...very tired; but. Not. Yet. Beaten. Now for the droids\\, good & bad; R2 & 3PO were there\\, supporting the main characters\\, but the real MVP was BB8\\, who has now truly taken the title of most bada$$ droid in the SWU\\, having dethroned R2; I can't go into detail\\, but rest assured\\, he won fair & square! And there was an evil BB unit as well\\, which I have dubbed BB 8-ball\\, he wasn't just evil\\, but smart\\, it's always good to see a smart villain. The background characters were able to really shine without stealing the spotlight\\, they really made the Resistance feel like a close knit family\\, they added some much needed depth to the universe.\\n\\nThe effects were not only true to ep 7\\, they were even better! Besides Snoke's upgrade\\, soooo many places & other characters were done practically\\, & the CGI was so crisp\\, you'd swear they'd gone back to pure model work! Starships\\, aliens\\, droids\\, worlds\\, I was there\\, interacting with real beings! It wasn't even in 3D\\, yet I was fully immersed!\\n\\nThe music was a perfect blend of classic trilogy & new trilogy\\, adding just the right punctuation.\\n\\nWhile it might be a bit slow...ok\\, really slow\\, in the middle\\, ep 8 still manages to have a decent amount of action\\, comedy\\, drama\\, & suspense\\, all while building & shaping things for the end of the new crown jewel of the SW franchise; the modern trilogy.\\n\\nI'm giving Star Wars Ep-8: The Last Jedi 3.5 stars out've 5. It was entertaining enough\\, but the slow middle drags it down. Not enough for me to consider it bad though\\, & the overall quality has really improved\\, so that's a plus. Now comes the agonizing wait for Episode 9!\\n\\n#MayTheForceBeWithYou","true":true}
