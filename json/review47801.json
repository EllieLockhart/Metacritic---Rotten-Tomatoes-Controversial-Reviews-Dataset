Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I start? The good? It's a Star Wars movie. The bad? Luke skywalker's character is wasted. Disney made a mockery of him. Really\\, did I wait 30 years to see him milk a sea cow? Apparently\\, I did. I like Rey. I really do! However\\, she's gone from Luke as an orphan to Luke at the beginning of \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" without any real training or trials. I wish I could grow in life as easily as Rey grows in these movies. Lastly -- and I'll say it -- The female characters are made stronger by chopping the male characters' legs off. The men are all idiots. Let me compare this to Star Trek: Voyager or Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Those shows had *very* strong female characters while also having very strong male characters. However\\, in Star Wars\\, the male characters are little babies. Did I wait 30 years to see this? Yes\\, I did.","true":true}
