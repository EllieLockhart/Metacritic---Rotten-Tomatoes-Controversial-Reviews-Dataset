Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, this is a great bean count movie. It was entertaining without a doubt. However\\, as a true star wars fan (someone who saw all the movies\\, read the books\\, played the video games) I would have to say that this movie does not honor the spirit of Star Wars. In killing off Luke Skywalker\\, Disney has made the same mistake as Hasbro when they decided to kill off Optimus Prime when they were making way fior the second generation of the Transformers line. Disney and Rian Johnson will soon realize the totality of their epic blunder.  But\\, I do not think they will care so long as this movie makes them a lot of money. So\\, please count on bean counters!","true":true}
