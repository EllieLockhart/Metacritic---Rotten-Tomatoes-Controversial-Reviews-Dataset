Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful spacebattles\\,costumes\\,setpieces. the comical timing and setup was terrible. I could forgive that.what I cant forgive is how they handled the plots handed over from the force awakens\\, how they treated Luke and Leia\\, They made fun of the fans expectations of certain cliffhangers from the previous film. SPOILERS:SPOILERS: how does Luke respond to getting his lightsaber back? he throws it away as a cheap comical point. Who is Snoke?never mind\\,he is dead. Do the republic finally see the danger of the first order now? oh\\, they arent mentioned and\/or is crushed already? Who is Reys parents? oh they are inconsequensial? What awesome powers have Luke gained as a Master? oh\\,he shut himself from the force and moping around before he dies\\, drinking green milk from the balls of a spacekritter that looked like it got to a climax when milked. what the....the casino run looked like   the Norwegian stop motion picture \\\"fl\u00e5klypa grand prix\\\" google it and you get the same silly sense. This movie completly wrecked my entusiasm for the fantastic star wars universe. it will still make billions without my money in the future\\, but that is the only way i can have a vote\\,not bringing them my money.If there are enough of us\\,maybe they one beautiful day need to care about what they serve us. Cause now they are feeding us the bottom of the barrel and we ask for seconds\\,Disney gladly supply.","true":true}
