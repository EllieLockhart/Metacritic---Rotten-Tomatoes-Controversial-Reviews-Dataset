Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m a truly gutted by this movie\\, with the death of Carrie Fisher you now have the scenario where you will not have any of the original cast in episode 9\\, or the ridiculous possibility of a computer generated princess Lea or a ghost Luke Skywalker\\, both possibilities fill me with dread. The ridiculous death and lack of background story regarding snoake was amateur at best and for the god like character of Luke to go out with a whimper the way he did was pathetic. I really can\u2019t see a way back for the franchise \\, it was as if Disney asked the director \u201chow can we kill Star Wars\u201d and he made this movie. In the final analysis their purchase of the starwars franchise could be the biggest mistake since the Mcdonald brothers sold their company for 2.7 million\\, cause in my eyes the franchise will now die a slow death.","true":true}
