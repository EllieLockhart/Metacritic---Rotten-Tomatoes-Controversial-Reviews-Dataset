Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Damn shame what they did to this movie - fine with creative choices when they take the story forward with respect to what went before it - this one failed to do the latter. It seems Darth Mouse is so pre-occupied with creating twists and mysteries that can keep the fans speculating for two years\\, while paying no attention to telling a good story. Got no problem with the Snoke theories being all kinds of wrong\\, but sending the most iconic sci-fi hero out this way just breaks my heart. Fans have kept this franchise alive since 1977\\, not studios - the character development that this movie took\\, is just taking a big piss on fans and a legacy that Disney had no hand in building.","true":true}
