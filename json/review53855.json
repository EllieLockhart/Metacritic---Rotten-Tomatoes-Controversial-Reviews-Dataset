Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"his guards is one of the most badass moments in the entirety of the series. Same thing with Luke's final moment. The problem is\\, that I felt both of these things (Luke dying & Rey & Kylo teaming up to defeat Snoke) would happen in Episode 9. Now what happens? I almost have no desire to watch the next film because the only real thing it could be about is Rey defeating or turning Kylo. This film could have easily been split into two films\\, but instead we have to wait 2 years to see if JJ Abrams can  figure out a way to make the new story line interesting again","true":true}
