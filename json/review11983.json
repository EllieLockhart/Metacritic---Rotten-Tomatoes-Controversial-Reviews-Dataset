Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely despised this film.\\n\\nThe last Jedi managed to run for 2 hours 30 minutes and not answer any questions or move the story forwards.\\n\\nA mediocre string of sub plots\\, riddled with an obvious political agenda.\\n\\nRemoving characters from the original trilogy one by one and stripping them of dignity and respect.\\n\\nForced humour to cover up the lack of story combined with shameless attempts to make more money by Disney Corporation have turned a beloved franchise into a cash cow with little respect to the original vision Lucas created 40 years ago. \\n\\nIt took Disney 4 years and the better part of a billion dollars to kill Star Wars. Now they spit on its grave by making films that lack any creativity and disrespect what came before it.","true":true}
