Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most complex of all of the Star Wars movies. Focuses much more on characters than it does the plot. It explores what drives these characters and makes them human. It's a film that needs to be watched more than once to be truly understood. The performances and visuals are spectacular. While not flawless\\, this is a strong contender for one of the best in the franchise.","true":true}
