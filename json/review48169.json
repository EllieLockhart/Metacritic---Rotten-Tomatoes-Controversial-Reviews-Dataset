Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually and technically crafted at a high level\\, the plot was contrived\\, and new characters pushed forward at the expense of the older established characters. To quote Mark Hamill \\\"This is no my Luke\\, this is Jake Skywalker\\\"...  Also they \\\"Lucasarts\\\" was heavy handed with the inserted politics of the real world... SW is escapism\\, I don't need a refresher on the 1%\\, slave kids\\, or the plight of alien horses","true":true}
