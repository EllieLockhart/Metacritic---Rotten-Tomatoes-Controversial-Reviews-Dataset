Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You cannot please everyone\\, especially Star Wars fans who think that if you do anything new (The Lady Jedi) or copy too much (The Force Awakens) then you\u2019re ruining Star Wars. This movie is great and should not be reviewing as much criticism.","true":true}
