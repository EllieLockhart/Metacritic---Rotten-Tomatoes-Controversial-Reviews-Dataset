Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not waste your money. If you are a fan of the entire star wars franchise\\, then this movie will only disappoint you. The only hope I had going in was that this movie be better than that steaming pile \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\" Sadly this movie couldn't even live up to that low of a standard. I will not be seeing episode IS\\, and I encourage all of you to do the same so Disney sees that they can't churn out crap and get rewarded.","true":true}
