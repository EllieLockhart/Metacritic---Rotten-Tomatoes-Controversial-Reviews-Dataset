Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This may be the best Star Wars to date. Good character development\\, comedy\\, and action. It was fun from start to finish. It had so many moments that really pulled on the heart strings in a great way. All these negative reviews make absolutely no sense to me\\, for once the critics seem to be right! This movie is amazing!? ","true":true}
