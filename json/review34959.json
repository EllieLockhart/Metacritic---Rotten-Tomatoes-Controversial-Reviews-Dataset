Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the film offers an amazing skill of being unpredictable. that being said\\, the high expectations are deflected as you are left with the shock and awe factor. the film provides a new spin that star wars never did before. its performances go a long way of being stellar; ridley and driver have such powerful chemistry. 4.5\/5","true":true}
