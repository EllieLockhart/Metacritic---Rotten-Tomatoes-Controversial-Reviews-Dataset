Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So i wanted to love it but i didn't. To have a good story you need to have a good and convincing antagonist and strong motivation to do the things you believe in. For me\\, the whole story arc and characters are not convincing and they are stuck in limbo (thank god for Ray\\, the only character that develops a bit). Kylo continues to be even more emo (if that was possible)\\, princess Lea goes full Superman in space\\, Snoke is totally not important nor are the reasons of dark side supremacy\\, main spaceship battles are dragged and main space pursuit goes forever (till there is fuel???).  But with all the faults and dead ends\\, movie has an epic feel to it. Some parts are entertaining and it is a nice cinema experience. Shame that my expectations were too high.","true":true}
