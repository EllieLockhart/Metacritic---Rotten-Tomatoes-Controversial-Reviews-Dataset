Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has always been a flawed franchise\\, but The Last Jedi removed everything endearing from it. The new characters were boring when not aggravating or completely unnecessary\\, the breaks in basic scientific logic were insulting\\, and the beloved legacy characters were handled so haphazardly it's brought into question whether the director or writers had any love for them in the first place. Some well-choreographed action sequences are a pleasure to watch\\, but hardly redeem this soulless cash-in of a beloved franchise.","true":true}
