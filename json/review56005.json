Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seems like neckbeards are coming out of the woodworks to rate this movie (that they have seen multiple times and own the blue ray for) poorly.  Was it perfect?  No.  Was it better than ALL of the prequels and  as good as Eps 6 and 7 though not as strong as 4 and 5 nor is it as good as Rogue One.  This movie did not kill the franchise nor did Disney- had it remained in the hands of Lucas\\, we would have never had more movies and if we did\\, they would be the Prequels all over again.","true":true}
