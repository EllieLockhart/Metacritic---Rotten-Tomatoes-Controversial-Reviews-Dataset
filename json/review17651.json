Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I stopped going to major releases a time ago because I've always found myself disappointed. All of them seemed to be boring and predictable\\, milking the same old stories: good guys beat bad guys\\, the young reckless kid is right\\, etc.\\n\\nSo I went to this movie fully expecting this kind of crap. Fortunately (and surprisingly)\\, I was completely blown away by this movie. Every minute kept me on the edge of my seat\\, waiting to see what is going to happen next. I have not felt this kind of suspense while watching a movie for years.\\n\\nOutside this\\, the movie has some amazing scenes. I was constantly getting goosebumps\\, and I'm considering going to see it again only to watch one of such scenes.\\n\\nI would say that this movie is a masterpiece\\, the best Star Wars movie since \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\". By far. I cannot recommend enough that you go watch it. 10\/10","true":true}
