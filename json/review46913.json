Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in with no expectation. I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't perfect and had a couple of crazy scenes. But every Star Wars movie has had that. That's what makes them so endearing. I enjoyed this episode\\, the plot twists and turns\\, new characters mixed with old\\, and the great fight scenes. Pleasantly surprised and eagerly awaiting the next episode.","true":true}
