Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"after seeing this film 4 times... I finally feel I can give it a proper review. Pros: -Luke scenes -Action -THAT SOUND TRACK -The complexity of Kylo Ren -That call back -Taking risks Cons: -some comedy -some Leia stuff -The entire casino thing -Phasma -left with more questions than answers I really enjoyed the film\\, but there were a few things that really irritated me. I get that Disney decided to take risk and make this different than other Star Wars movies\\, but some of these things didn't work for me. Honestly\\, I felt indifferent after seeing it the first time but after a second viewing I really enjoyed it. it has gotten better with every viewing. I am excited to see the direction they continue going because I really feel it is unpredictable. ","true":true}
