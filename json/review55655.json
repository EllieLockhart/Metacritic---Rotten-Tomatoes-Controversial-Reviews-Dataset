Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of all the wonderful possibilities in the Star Wars Universe - both Cinematic and EU - the choices made for this movie were worst than dire.... I've been a long term fan of Star Wars\\, consuming lots of information from many sources - novels\\, games\\, series\\, etc.... I felt this fickle attempt at making it new and fresh worked as well as poisoning the soil to make it fertile again... It left me bereft of any meaningful fan status for the entire  saga... I couldn't care less what happens next. My fandom has died with this movie. Well Done Disney. you've truly delivered a Christmas Turkey (deja vu with Phantom Menace\\, only a lot worse)","true":true}
