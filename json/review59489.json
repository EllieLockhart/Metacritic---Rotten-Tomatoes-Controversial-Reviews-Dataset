Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Found this gem in a comment section: However I have to completely disagree about the game passing the message of \\\"revenge destroys you\\\" to the player at all. First of all\\, any time a character does a morally good action\\, the story punishes them for it (Joel saved a total stranger-> she kills him\\, Abby spared Ellie and Tommy->they come for her\\, ellie tried to get information from bf-dude and pregnant-lady without killing them->they try to kill her and she's forced to kill them). Ellie did indeed lose everything in her quest for vengeance and in the end did the morally right thing and forgave Abby\\, therefore forfeiting her revenge. Abby lost nothing in her quest for revenge and even accomplished it\\, most of her friends died at the hands of ellie in self defense and they weren't just innocent bystanders\\, they were accomplishes to Joel's murder\\, and in the end having satisfied her lust for revenge even gets a chance at redemption and a proper life in the form of Lev. So one of the characters gets her revenge\\, loses nothing to achieve it and in the end gets a chance at a new life while the other forfeits her revenge (having killed literally hundreds of unrelated people to get to that point)\\, loses literally everything she has in the process and has absolutely no chance at redemption\\, having lost even her father's final gift to her (playing the guitar). If anything\\, the message I got was \\\"seeking revenge or not\\, be as ruthless as you can be\\, lower your guard for no one even if they're tied up and at the point of a gun\\, leave no loose ends and never forgive\\\"\\, which I'm pretty sure is not the message ND intended\\, basically turning us all into tlou1's Joel\\, the guy they are trying so hard to frame as an irredeemable villain.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
