Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is packed with jaw dropping action. It strikes a perfect balance of action\\, humor\\, and nostalgia. Is is telling its own story\\, not re-hashing old plots\\, which is great. The depth of Leia's involvement is awesome and fitting.","true":true}
