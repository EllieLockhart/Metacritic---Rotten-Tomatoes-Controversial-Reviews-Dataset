Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not an angry fanboy\\, it's just an awful movie. The writing is so bad in so many ways that I seriously doubt that George Lucas could have done worse. What sucks is that this movie will make a billion dollars and Blade Runner 2049 (an imperfect but vastly superior movie) lost money.","true":true}
