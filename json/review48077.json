Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the film is visually stunning\\, it takes more than money to make a good movie.\\n\\nSome movies get better the more you think about the movie once you leave the cinema\\, other movies just get worse as you recall the plot holes and inexplicably bad writing that resulted in familiar characters doing uncharacteristic things.\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi is definitely one of the latter kind of movies.","true":true}
