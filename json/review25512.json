Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers here. This movie has taught the world a valuable lesson. DONT OVERDO EXPECTATIONS. This film plays with expectations so much that it is sure to piss off fans. You go into this film without expectations or very minimal expectations\\, then you'll likely appreciate the hell out of the Star Wars film that has done something new and extremely bold. Good job Rian Johnson.","true":true}
