Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie. So many plot holes. All you had to do Rian Johnson was follow Episode 7's arc. Just follow the arc. You are making a second movie in a trilogy. Follow the arc. Instead\\, you introduced random elements and extinguished several plots from episode 7. That isnt your job. Your job was to continue the arc from episode 7 and build upon that story. Instead\\, you just wrote a tangential story that didnt progress the story that was started in episode 7. This makes no sense. There were so many stories in episode 7 that just disappeared. Which is fine if you are making a different story\\, but you are making the second chapter in a trilogy. You didnt develop any characters\\, you had so many plot holes\\, you did progress any arcs and the pacing was garbage.\\n\\nEpisode 7 built a solid foundation for Episode 8 to expound upon and Rian Johnson just farted on it.","true":true}
