Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hi there\\, I'm another bot posting a negative review (\/sarcasm)\\n\\nEnough has been said about this movie to the extent that it would be pointless of me to repeat it\\, but if I can encapsulate what's ultimately wrong with it\\, it's that this movie was not value adding in any shape or form.\\n\\nTFA was derivative of A New Hope\\, but it added value. It set up mysteries (what happened to Luke\\, why did he disappear etc\\, who is Snoke etc.)\\, it set up characters (the mystery of Rey's lineage)\\, it set up things to look forward to (e.g. the Knights of Ren)\\n\\nThis movie added nothing. It was basically a long TV episode of another pointless struggle between the Resistance and the First Order. You could remove this movie and you wouldn't lose any major story element from Canon.\\n\\nAside from the \\\"death\\\" of Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nWhat an ignoble end for a character who stood up to the most powerful Sith Lord in history - \\\"I am a Jedi\\, like my father before me.\\\"\\n\\nInstead\\, he died on a rock. Why we don't know.\\n\\nIf Luke had died there on the battlefield\\, sacrificing his life to save the survivors\\, that alone would have saved the movie for me.\\n\\nBut he didn't. He died on a rock. Whilst patronising Kylo Ren with petty insults.\\n\\n","true":true}
