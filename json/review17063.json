Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. It makes me want to see the first three entries from this franchise. I really have only seen the last 2 or 3 and I would like to compare since the last few really seem to follow the same blueprint. There were some great individual performances in this instalment and some thrilling moments. Great film\\, definitely will watch the next one even though Im not a die hard Star Wars fan.","true":true}
