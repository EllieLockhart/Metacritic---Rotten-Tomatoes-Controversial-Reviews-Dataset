Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The treatment of Luke Skywalker was a gut punch. People have their favorite characters in the SW saga but Luke IS Star Wars so to see a character that you care about and have seen grow up on screen get treated so shabbily is a sad thing. Who would do that to the actor? And the audience has been waiting to see THIS character for 40 years\\, or at least imagined him in a good place. This movie has a lot of flaws and some good stuff too and one could forgive it for its flaws if it didn't destroy the main character of the whole saga.  Having \\\"good\\\" female characters is a must but Rey is too perfect and powerful to care about. She is not human. The other characters are okay but are hard to care about. I liked Rian Johnson's Looper and Brick and again\\, I would have turned a blined eye to the film's failings and just enjoyed it if Luke was treated like the hero he's supposed to be\\,  These Disney sequels have no success stories\\, all of our heroes are failures. Han is a deadbeat dad who raised a psychotic and Luke is a loser who should have never left the farm. It's amazing that a whole 40 yr saga of comics\\, novels\\, games\\, cartoons\\, and of course movies\\, can be uprooted by one cynical twist of a movie.","true":true}
