Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's either the length or the reliance on a single plot thread that stretches from beginning to end that makes this movie so achingly dull. The misplaced humour breaks up some of the tedium but it comes at the expense of cheapening some potentially serious story themes. Several characters could have used more attention.  \\n\\nThat said\\, the visuals are on point and appear technically sound.  \\n\\nA big disappointment for both fans and casual acquaintances of the franchise.","true":true}
