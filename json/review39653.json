Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a bad movie. Anybody with a mind of their own can see that. Like\\, this is unforgivably bad. So many counterintuitive pointless scenes\\, so many dumb moments. It's hard to believe this is a accident. A movie this bad has to be purposely made this way. Like\\, every sing;e chance they have to diminish a character they take. Just look at Snokes face when he dies\\, he looks needlessly moronic. My theory is this movie was made to cause outrage amongst older fans to make them seem overly sensitive and not reasonable\\, just to make younger people feel more important. When a new star wars fan see negative reviews about this movie they probably think; \\\"Hey\\, this is star wars. star was is good.  what a bunch of bitter old men\\\"\\, when in reality they have every reason to hate it because it goes entirely against the arcs and terminology of what a fan expects from the series. I could go a bit further\\, and say this is to reinforce a hive-mind like complex over films so that the only thing that matters in a film is its branding\\, and not the content within the movie itself.","true":true}
