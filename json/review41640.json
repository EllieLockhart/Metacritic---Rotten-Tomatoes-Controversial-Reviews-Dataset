Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is incoherent both within itself and other SW films that it's amazing it was approved to be made. There's no meaningful message behind it. Eg. Holdo's sacrifice is contradicted by Rose's reaction to Finn trying to destroy the big gun. Greenpeace action on Canto is stupid\\, because they free space-horses and leave child slaves behind. There is no explanation whatsoever why Luke would forget all that he learned in eps. IV-VI and try to kill a sleeping kid. If Kylo was such a threat why he can kill any armed person without help? If Yoda can do lightnings why didn't he use it in the past? The list of issues with this movie is long. The bottom line for me is to finally\\, after 40 years\\, grow up and stop buying Star Wars stuff for my kids.","true":true}
