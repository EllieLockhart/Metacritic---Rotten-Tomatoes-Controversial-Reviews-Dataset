Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Even if the story isn\u00b4t the way we expected after watching the trailers or replaying the incredible first part\\, The Last of Us Part II is an amazing game. The graphics\\, details\\, facial expressions and just everything is very polished. Even if the gameplay is very similar to the first one\\, the improvements on the AI makes it a different and more interesting challenge. As I\u00b4ve seen\\, the story\\,  the decision of making almost half of the game to be played as Abby and the ending are the most disliked parts by players. But I really don\u00b4t think those decisions are bad\\, they make you experience the game from a new perspective to show you that there is no villain or hero in this world\\, just people trying to survive and hoping their loved ones survive as well.\rMy only \\\"complaint\\\" would be that I think Abby\u00b4s part sometimes felt a little dragged and some of the characters in her side of the story weren\u00b4t really memorable\\, but nothing too bad or excessive\\, I think the ending was justified and a good way to end this story\\, even if it clearly isn\u00b4t a happy ending or anything close to it\\, since Ellie\u00b4s ending is absolutely hearth-breaking.\rThis game was truly an emotional rollercoaster\\, filled with amazing and emotional moments that will be in my mind for a long time\\, as this just became one of my favorite games of all time.\r\rNaughty dog really didn\u00b4t lie when they said that some players would love the game and other would hate it. I guess the best way to find out i trying it out for yourself ad making your own opinion about it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
