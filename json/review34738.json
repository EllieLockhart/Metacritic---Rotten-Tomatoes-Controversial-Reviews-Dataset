Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The death of Star Wars. Semi-interesting sci-fi movie\\, if you can get past all the plot holes and the many annoyingly convenient coincidences. The reality is\\, it was an attempt to re-write Star Wars\\, by infusing it with the writers personal views and politics. The Last Jedi turned out to be The Last Star Wars Movie I was interested in watching. There's no New Hope for JJ trying to scrounge the mess that was left for him to salvage for making episode 9.","true":true}
