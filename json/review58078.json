Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst film in the franchise. Huge disappointment after the masterpiece of Rogue One. Rian managed to ruin Star Wars. YOU CAN'T DROP BOMBS IN SPACE AND PICK AND CHOOSE WHEN PEOPLE CAN\/CAN'T BREATH IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE\\, BE CONSISTENT.  Apparently Rian is also a feminist because he turned every guy in the series into bumbling idiot.","true":true}
