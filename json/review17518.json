Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I should have known that the corporate money making machine that purchased Star Wars would ruin it for any fan of good storytelling. The output is terrible and not worth your money\\, even though you'll experience it yourself\\, because it is called Star wars. I can't even write about this right now I am so annoyed at how bad this was. It's time to move on from Star wars\\, lets worship the originals for their greatness and ingenuity and leave the rest to the trash. Boycott Disney and their destruction of something special and magical.","true":true}
