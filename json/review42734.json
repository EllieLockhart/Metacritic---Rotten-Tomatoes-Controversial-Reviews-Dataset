Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was greatly disappointing as expectations were set high by the exciting trailers. The plots were scattered through the film and felt hollow. The continuity was off as well as the writing. Most of the character development were reversed back into how they started in the beginning of the film. The film dragged on as many of the plots could've been cut without making any effect on the rest of the movie. The movie was overall forgettable as it didn't satisfy Star Wars fans and didn't provide a cliffhanger or twist that left you wanting more. It didn't feel like a Star Wars movie but a science fiction Marvel spin off.","true":true}
