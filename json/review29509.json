Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is the worst director I have seen EVER. Don't watch this movie as it is a tragedy of corporations doing a deplorable job of continuing a creative mega-franchise. It essentially neuters the lore of the universe forces romance stories and has NO logistics.also if you want to see marry poppins in space then here ya go leia in space also luke is wasted asset plot points if first movie that are squandered! It's so bad that when luke dies people in the theatre were yelling \\\"come on\\\" due to the awful writing and HUGE plot holes and death of luke skywalker.","true":true}
