Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\nA movie that did almost everything wrong. This is not a SW movie\\, this is spaceballs 2.\\nOpening scene starts with the \\\"raspberry\\\" scene from spaceballs and then contniues with this kind of \\\"humor\\\" throught the whole movie\\, comicity is something that should be used with common sense\\, not thrown random like salt sprinkled on a steak.\\nThe main plot is non-existent\\, with Rey trying to convince a clown Skywalker to teach her\\, and her friends that go on a totally useless mission because nobody told them there was already another plan\\, which in turn allows the enemy to discover this secret plan.\\nUseless characters and scenes like DJ (benicio del toro) and the whole aformentioned mission.\\nEverthing we were waiting to know or see from ep.VII is still without answer\\, because some characters died in ep.VIII and we are still wondering what the heck was their purpose apart from filling a hole in a plot that is already riddled with such holes.\\nThe millenium falcon\\, yet again\\, flies into a tight canyon\\, yay for that ! (this is an ironic statement). The only space battle we see is a whole failure\\, I'm not saying every battle should be a scripted my a navy mastermind admiral\\, but for the love of God what where you thinking when you decided to have 5 or more bobmabrdiers carrying a huge load of rigged bombs close toghether? One explodes and triggers a chain reaction leaving only one? This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen and my tactical warfare skills are limited to videogamas\\, it's just WRONG! Then what ? you blame Poe Dameron\\, wtf ! NO! You blame the general or the admiral or whoever is in command.\\nThe only 2 scenes I liked this movie where the cruiser used like a hyperspace bullet and Luke creating the illusion of himself\\, the rest of the movie is basically trash.\\nAlso\\, Porgs are annoying\\, Phasma's death is even more disappointing than Snoke's.\\nGood direction of photography though\\, especially on the red\/white planet\\, which unfortunately looks a lot like Hoth\\, even the \\\"battle\\\" if we can call like that a battle.\\n\\nVERY\\, VERY disappointed. Worst SW movie so far.","true":true}
