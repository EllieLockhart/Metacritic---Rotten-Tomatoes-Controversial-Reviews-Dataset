Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An entertaining movie with visually stunning settings. Sadly\\, it misses the emotional connection with audiences that the previous movie did so well. Also\\, many silly moments and dialogues that don't fit the movie rhythm.","true":true}
