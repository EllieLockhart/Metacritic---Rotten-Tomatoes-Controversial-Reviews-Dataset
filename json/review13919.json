Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are looking for a Star Wars movie this is not it. Story is completely inconsistent\\, characters are bland with little development and no plot to really progress the movie. This movie just pushes explosions and new characters at your hoping you won't notice the fact that there is no substance. Dialog between characters might as well be written by a 12 year old and relationships between characters is forced and unnatural feeling. I highly suggest saving you money and watching this when it comes out on a streaming service if you absolutely have to watch it. This movie is probably only the 2nd time I've ever left a theater angry.","true":true}
