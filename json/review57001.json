Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They really messed this one up. After seeing the trailers I was expecting a story driven suspenseful movie with still an appropriate amount of comedy. What we got was a movie that wasted every opportunity to be good and threw a big middle fingers  to the fans that have supported the franchise over he many years. This film had more similarities to Episode 1 in the form of worthless filler and subplots that robbed the core story. I don't know who is at fault for this travesty but I hope there barred for Star Wars for the rest of their lives. Remember Disney the fans pay to see the movies\\, not the critics. \\n\\nWith that being out of the way there are some good aspects of the movies\\, but the content is just handled so poorly.","true":true}
