Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I watched The Force Awakens\\, I had to do it 3 times in order to like it and I didn't. And I use to watch Star Wars movies couple of times just for pure enjoyment This one I watched once and I find it at least a little bit more original than The Force Awakens and some of the element I do like. However\\, second time when trendy politics that slowly is becoming a sexism almost a hate toward male characters made me leave the cinema in the middle of the movie. But that is story for someone else.\\nWhat I did like in this movie is that Snake died very early and considering this character didn't represent anything special in Star Wars universe it did make sense. He should go down from the beginning same as the New order.  Snoke spoils overall beauty of the Sith and as such is not worthy successor as supremo of dark side. I am very skeptical for the upcoming\\, episode 9.","true":true}
