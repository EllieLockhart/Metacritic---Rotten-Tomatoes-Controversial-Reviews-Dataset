Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a decent movie but its not a good Star Wars movie. It has many issues that only Star Wars fans will care about. Worth watching in the cinema once so you can at least experience it and make up your own mind.","true":true}
