Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are no words to express how awful this film was. To illustrate just how nonsensical the plot of this film really is without spoiling too much\\, let me just reveal that the heroes at one point have their plans thwarted by-I kid you not-A PARKING VIOLATION\\, and it just keeps getting worse from there. I'm thankful that I at least didn't pay for my ticket\\, but I'll never get that two and a half hours of my life back.","true":true}
