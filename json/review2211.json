Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first I was anticipating a rehash of Empire Strikes Back. And I'm okay with it\\, I won't complain about familiarity or recycling ideas. But Rian Johnson successfully deliver unexpected turn in every corner of the story. And it is the right thing to do. Rey-Luke relationship will be like Luke-Yoda? Not quite. Luke is a bitter person for his failure\\, he was the optimistic person in the galaxy but now he is the most pessimistic. The Last Jedi\\, without trying to spoil the story\\, managed to open huge potential of where the saga will take its next step. Mark Hammil gives his best performance as Luke Skywalker here\\, so does the late Carrie Fisher in her last role. The new cast gives their strong performance\\, though as character\\, Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo stands out. Almost everyone in the story got their new point of view in facing the world. It's a great and complete storytelling from start to finish.","true":true}
