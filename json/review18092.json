Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this second chapter in a new star-wars saga. while the film was long\\, it was an excellent blend of the fun and the serious\\, coming together to make a film that is a growing experience for the entire cast\\, and one of the best performances Mark Hamill has ever produced.","true":true}
