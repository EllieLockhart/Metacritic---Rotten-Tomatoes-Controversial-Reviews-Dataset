Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok. Yes directing a Star Wars movie must be pretty patronising\\, since the franchise means so much to so many people. However there is no excuse for poor story telling. This movie had everyone quite as they walked out of the  cinema. It was like they had just been watching a blank screen. The plot seemed to go no where\\, the character of Rose and Captain Haldo where just plain painful\\, especially Rose knowing she will be in the next film unfortunately. What happened to Star Wars. To tell you the truth I love the prequels as much as the original trilogy because of the over arching story telling. These new sequels are so on your face SJW That it's off putting. I pray to got Ep 9 will bring everything to a neat conclusion and make sense of this jumbled up story that has been made by two different directors who ( want to story to go different ways)","true":true}
