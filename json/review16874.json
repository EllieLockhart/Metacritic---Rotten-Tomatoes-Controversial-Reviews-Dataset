Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the end luke Skywalker was not a jedi or jedi master the best he got to was padwon. \\n\\nIn all the cannon of the star wars universe a padron is led by a jedi through there training. The padwon will face the dark side in there own way the jedi will guid they through this. \\n\\nWhat dos luke do as a jedi trainer gets scared by a padwon going to the dark and trys to kill them in there sleep.  Yes luke is very strong with the force but he had nothing els the jedi must have to be known as jedi","true":true}
