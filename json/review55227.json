Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just going to repeat what a lot of people are saying:\\nAnakin was the chosen one and concieved by the force and still had to train most of his life to get to where he was.  Luke went through extensive training too.  However Ray and her now meaningless backstory just trumps all of that?  K.  Humor was poorly written\\, EXTREMELY cringe.  Straight disrespected Luke.  I wanted to rip my eyes out when Leia survived in space with the force. Mishandled all of the tools given to them to make a great movie.  I feel like Rian Johnson's idea of a good plot is to just do the opposite of what everyone wants and not put any thought into how he could execute it well..  I consider TFA a star wars movie but i'm trying so dang hard to pretend like TLJ never happened.","true":true}
