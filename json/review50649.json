Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"5\/5 I don't usually give five star reviews\\, but this one really deserves it. Not only is it one of the best Star Wars films to date but one of the best films I've seen this year. Full of great characters\\, epic moments\\, and unexpected twists. A great film for any Star Wars fan.","true":true}
