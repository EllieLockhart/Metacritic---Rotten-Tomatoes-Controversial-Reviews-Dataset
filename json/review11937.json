Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely disappointing. Worst Starwars movie of them all. Boring\\, lacks any charm or imagination. I am really struggling to think of a single epic standout moment in the whole film. Even the Phantom Menace had memorable moments such as the Pod Race and Darth Maul. So many problems. Snoke's lame death. Uninteresting new characters with zero development. Kylo Ren is a weak villain. Leia can fly through space i mean come on... really!? The Jedi faith is literally tossed away on a holiday island. I could go on.","true":true}
