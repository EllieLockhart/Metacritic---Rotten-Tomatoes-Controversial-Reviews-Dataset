Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson leaves us with a emotionless story with little depth.  The characters are unbelievable.  Poor attempts at humor are thrown in at critical points in the story.  I felt like I was watching a burning bag of dog crap!  Thx!  This made\\, The Force Awakens\\, look like a good film.","true":true}
