Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A SW movie that breaks its own cannon. Visually very beautiful\\, it is a pretty film\\, but...that's about it. The characters from 7 ALL regress\\, back to the beginning of episode 7 it's like the director hit the reset button of all character development for those that even had any. There are some neat new force powers introduced. The director was looking to \\\"subvert expectations\\\"...well I will compare it this way. I went to a sushi restaurant\\, and I ordered the sushi mystery special\\, so the waiter brought me a burrito topped with oatmeal.","true":true}
