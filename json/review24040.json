Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill's career best performance. Some of the plot holes are an issue\\, but the overarching themes are well delivered and welcome. The Star Wars universe has become a bigger\\, more inclusive place.","true":true}
