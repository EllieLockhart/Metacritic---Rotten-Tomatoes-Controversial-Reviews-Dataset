Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first movie\\, they really just redid the extended universe. This one\\, they changed the characteristics of some the principal players. You can't change the core of who some is about\\, morally.\\nThe ending kind of reminded me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. That isn't a compliment.","true":true}
