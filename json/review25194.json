Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice continuation of the franchise. Mark Hammill was great. Some interesting twists. Solid visuals and sound editing. Daisy Ridley & Adam Driver seem well-poised to bring us into the second phase of the series.","true":true}
