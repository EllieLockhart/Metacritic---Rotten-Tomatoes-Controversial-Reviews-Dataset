Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, The Last Jedi is equal parts infuriating and heartbreaking. All of the mythology and heroism of Star Wars is disassembled in this film and replaced with a watered-down\\, corporate-friendly franchise where characters can be cast aside on a whim and sequels can be produced on an assembly line.\\nLeaving the 'Star Wars' aspect of the movie behind\\, there are a few good scenes and some special effects and cinematography that are gripping and thrilling\\, but the film as a whole is far too disjointed with flat\\, uninteresting characters to stand on its own even if it were unconnected to the larger franchise. Even the new characters are largely shafted by this film\\, with most going on convoluted sub plots that pad out the screen time and ultimately have no bearing on the story itself.\\nSomeone at Disney obviously noticed all of the emo Kylo Ren memes because they make a specific point of shaming him to the point where he destroys his helmet\\, only to put him on an arc that comes so close to being a very visceral exploration of what it means to be evil before allowing him to devolve into a simple caricature.\\nRey is no better off as the heroic female character we were previously given is apparently unworthy of a compelling backstory of her own and she becomes just a formless vehicle for the audience to explore Luke and Kylo's personal and moral failings.\\nAnd Luke\\, while expertly played by Mark Hamill\\, is the most shocking disappointment of the film. It is truly horrifying to watch a childhood hero contemplate murdering a sleeping child. It leaves me at a total loss and my heart is broken because of it.\\nWhere Force Awakens was a very respectful and thrilling passing of the torch\\, this film takes that torch and sets 40 years of fandom on fire.","true":true}
