Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another film ruined by Social Justice moral busybodies. I truly hope this does not make enough money to cover it's costs. I don't want to be preached to by neo-marxists for the next twenty years. It is like opening a dance club and playing 70's music. When you completely ignore your core audience you should pay the price.","true":true}
