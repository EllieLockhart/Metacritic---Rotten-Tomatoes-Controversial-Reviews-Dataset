Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My friends and I highly enjoyed this installment. We did not expect most of the movies twists and turns. It made us excited for the next movie. While it's sad that Leia won't be in it anymore\\, her character was well featured. The experience in the theater was also one to remember. There were many funny and sad moments\\, but overall it was fantastic. I don't understand all of the bashing\\, it was creative and met my expectations.","true":true}
