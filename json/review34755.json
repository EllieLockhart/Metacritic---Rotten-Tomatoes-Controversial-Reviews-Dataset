Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The devils in the details one this one. While the new version of Luke's Character initially felt heartbreaking to me as a huge fan of the old cannon\\, but Mark Hamil's performance is spectacular and compelling. Some good dialogue some really cheesey stuff too. Really great moments placed amongst some really bad ones too... it's a bit like the force... a balance of both good and bad. NOT AS NAD AS SOME ARE RAVING","true":true}
