Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson delivers on the most ambitious Star Wars film to-date.  Bold\\, smart\\, rich with story and character depth\\, Johnson understands the heart of Star Wars goes beyond its superficial iconography.  While a tad overlong and a bit messy at times (though never sloppy)\\, The Last Jedi hits where it counts\\, and features some of the best material this franchise has seen since The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
