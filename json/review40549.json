Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst film I have seen in a long long time. The whole movie is full inconsistencies\\, plot holes and character assassination. The movie breaks the pre established rules setup by Star Wars franchise and The Force Awakens. It even breaks its own rules. It  is very lacking in continuity. The tone is all over the place. The comedy is inserted in inappropriate moments. It sounds like a fanfiction brought to screen and a very bad one at that. I am very disappointed that this movie has been released as a part of my beloved franchise.","true":true}
