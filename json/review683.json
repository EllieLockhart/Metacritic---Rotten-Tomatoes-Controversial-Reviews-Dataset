Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing installment that continues to build the new characters. It's a much more bold and risky film than Episode VII. It doesn't retread old ground and is the most original film since Empire.","true":true}
