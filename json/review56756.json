Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was entertaining but seemed to erase all the other movies. Luke's character seemed opposite to what he really was as demonstrated by the other movies. Too much Leia\\, Poe had no real purpose\\, Rebel Alliance was weak and useless. Jedi was reduced to basically nothing. The movie was just misplaced and lacked hope and vision. In my opinion I would have liked to see the movie called \\\"Rise of the Jedi\\\" and Luke was powerful and in control waiting for Yoda and others to say \\\"Go now is the time\\\". Defeat the empire and the movie close with Luke and others around the once damaged Jedi council with Yoda\\, Obi Wan\\, Mace\\, and others who had gone on with some of the new Padwans. To me Episode 9 should be Luke waking and realizing what could have happened in episode 8. thus erasing a confusing movie.","true":true}
