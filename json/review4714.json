Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely and utterly disappointing. From a huge Star Wars fan they missed this completely. There is certainly a few good moments. Absolutely. However the bad in this film ruins the little good it had going for it. No interest in seeing this again or owning it. (From someone who saw Force Awakens 13 times in theaters.)","true":true}
