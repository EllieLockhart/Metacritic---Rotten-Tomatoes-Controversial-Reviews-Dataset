Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically ignored everything you believed about Star Wars and was not consistent with episode 7. Also the main plot was the slowest and most boring chase scene ever. It had some good parts but was disappointing. 2-3 stars max. Will watch again but doubt It will warrant a higher score. This totally removed any hype I had for episode 9. I hope Disney and jj steer the last of the trilogy correctly to a proper fanfare. ","true":true}
