Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not asking for my money back but at the same time I'm not eager to see it again...so decent but far from great. Not sure what the critics liked so much about it. On one hand I was happy there was no Death Star\\, on the other I thought the characters they introduced were bland and\\,much of the story was\\, quite frankly\\, unnecessary. They should have spent more time developing the characters they had and simplified the story. Didn't mind the humor but so much more could have been done. Luke (or Rey) raising the X-wing out of the water\\, Lando as the 'codebreaker'\\, Leia sacrificing herself to destroy the fleet\\, Luke coming out of isolation to lead the Republic in the last movie\\, introducing the Knights of Ren. So many missed opportunities. This movie may have been entertaining but was ultimately disappointing.","true":true}
