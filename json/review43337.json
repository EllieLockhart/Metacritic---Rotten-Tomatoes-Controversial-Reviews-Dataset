Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a hard movie to rate. There were things about the storyline that take some time to absorb. I didn?t really know how to feel afterwards. But I never felt it was a bad movie.\\nIt had incredible moments.\\nSome bizarre ones and a few that weren?t really needed.\\nMy biggest problem is they left too much unanswered.\\nThere also wasn?t enough character development in Rey.\\nBut I still think it?s good. They will need to tie some things together in part 3\\, otherwise it might be another matrix blunder. You know where the 2nd is ok\\, but the 3rd movie makes the trilogy pointless.\\nI?ll need to watch it again to take more in\\, but I appreciate what?s good about it.","true":true}
