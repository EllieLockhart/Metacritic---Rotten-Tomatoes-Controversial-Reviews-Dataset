Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning film\\, but many plot holes\\, and yes too much propaganda that does not belong.  I had not noticed it till after I thought about it.  I don't pay to be preached to at the theater.  Also if you care about the old characters\\, you may not like how they are dumbed down in this movie before being killed off.  Additionally\\, it seems there were questions left from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" that go either unanswered\\, or they are literally down-played as \\\"they don't matter\\\".\\n\\nIf you want some eye candy and can handle throwing away all previous iterations of Star Wars","true":true}
