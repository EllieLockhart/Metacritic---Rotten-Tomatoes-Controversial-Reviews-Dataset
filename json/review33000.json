Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story was dull and tired\\,. 2 Hours of filler and 30 minutes of story that really didn't save the movie for me. Too bad fans don't punish movie makers for bad movies. Everyone is going to see it\\, regardless of how bad it is. It was on par with Teletubbies and just as mind numbing.","true":true}
