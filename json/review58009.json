Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it's another dazzling special effects movie with a team of thousands of animators and the budget to match\\, the characters lost some of their integrity and core. The disgruntled Luke\\, Rey's insane Jedi gifts without any real training\\, and many other inconsistencies caused the movie to plod on longer than it needed to be. We're left with a completely broken rebellion\\, most of our favorite characters dead\\, and only the idea that this insane battle will go on forever without ever really conquering the Empire. Knowing that is the case makes any future episodes a bore. Not the best feeling leaving a movie\\, and certainly not even close to the campy ending of the original Star Wars\\, but it's still fun to watch 40 years later. The Last Jedi won't be remembered in the same way.","true":true}
