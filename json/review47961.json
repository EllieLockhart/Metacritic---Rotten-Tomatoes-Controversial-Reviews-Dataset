Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it isn't exempt of flaws with glaring plot holes\\, issues with pacing\\, and an awkward time skips(the movie takes place over an 18 hour period). It is by far the most emotionally charged of the franchise\\, it boldly goes out of its way to basically say to the audience\\, \\\"Get in loser\\, we're Star Wars whether you want to or not\\,\\\" and the several plot twists keep you guessing right to the very end. The central theme is change\\, letting go of the past\\, and the continuation of old ideals in a younger generation. Which makes it tough to pay much service to the fans and you may not love it\\, but I think that it's worthy of respect. Overall\\, its a movie to be experienced and I imagine that it'll be fun to rewatch for years to come.","true":true}
