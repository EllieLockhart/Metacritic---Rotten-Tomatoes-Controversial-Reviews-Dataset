Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, the very idea of this abortion in film form should have been enough for the writers and directors to kill themselves.  If you are planning on throwing your money away on this\\, you should just binge drink for a month\\, you would probably lose fewer brain cells that way.  In 2 and a half hours\\, you could probably just watch the older films or maybe even consider watching something you haven't seen before and actually expanding your horizons.  The first half of the movie just feels like they can't get it off the ground.  The longest +hour of your life will be sitting through the shit dialogue and poorly re-imagined versions of Luke and Leia.  There is even a superman scene which the writer seems to just have pulled out of their ass to justify keeping Leia alive seconds before they had killed her off just because.\\n\\nAs I watched the movie through\\, I was convinced that the people doing this just hated Star Wars with a passion.  Almost as if they woke up one day as angst ridden teenagers after being broken up with by their gender fluid partner and said \\\"I now know what I want to grow up to do.  I want to shit all over a beloved character and hero like Luke and attempt to destroy the entire franchise\\, just because I want to see the world burn and people be as shitty as me.\\\"  \\n\\nThere are a few sorta funny scenes in the movie with Luke\\, but honestly Mark is just giving us his prized shit eating grin as he himself realizes what a shit show the entire movie and re-imagining of his character really was.  After all\\, he was getting paid his millions.  Might as well not rock the boat to much eh?  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, I really wanted to enjoy it.  I kept talking myself into how much I liked Force Awakens\\, but after a year I realized how fruitless it was and it was better to just be honest.  What they've done with the whole saga is a shit stain on film making.  \\n\\nLuke is dead\\, if they bring Leia into the next one she will just be CGI'd into it\\, and Snoak is dead.  There is literally no point to even go watch the next one.  Any build up they did with the characters was wasted.  JJ\\, if he does the next one\\, is going to have a nearly impossible job to fix what these asshats broke.  Frankly\\, I don't even think he can fix it.","true":true}
