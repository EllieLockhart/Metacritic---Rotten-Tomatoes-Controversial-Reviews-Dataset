Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Painfully\\, post-modern. Overt regressive political pandering. Completely butches the original characters. Isn't even consistent within itself\\, scenes don't make sense and they completely drop entire plot points from the previous movie that the previous director put so much effort in getting the audience invested in. Looks good though.","true":true}
