Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow movie with many plot holes and disappointing characters. It was an okay movie over all however it didn\u2019t feel like a Star Wars movie at all. Many characters weren\u2019t used to their full potentials and others weren\u2019t used at all","true":true}
