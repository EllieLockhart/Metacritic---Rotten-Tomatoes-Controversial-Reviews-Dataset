Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hello Disney.\\n\\nDon't cry! The situation is not that tragic!\\n\\nAt least you will not have to find a place where to bury the digital release of this crappy movie.\\n\\n(though you'll need to find an humongous one to bury the unsold DVDs\\, BluRays and action figures\\, especially that of Rose Tico).\\n\\nN.B. Please tell Ruin Johnson to stop talking about this movie. Every time he opens his tiny mouth in his man-baby face and his creepy voice comes out\\, he makes the situation worse.","true":true}
