Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was over the top crazy CGI. Whatever happened to  character development? They didn't do a good job of developing Rey's character. Dialogue was just so boring. Very disappointed.","true":true}
