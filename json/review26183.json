Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NOT Star Wars. This movie did not feel like a Star Wars movie. There were poorly conceived scenes in the movie and several plot holes. Saw it twice on opening day thaten a few weeks later","true":true}
