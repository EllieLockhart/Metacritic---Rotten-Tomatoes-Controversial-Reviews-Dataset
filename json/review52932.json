Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another Fanboy pick'n'mix of original trilogy scenes and motifs. Slow\\, pointless plot lines and no rhythm\\, this monotonous dirge is only punctuated by glimpses of humour and better acting by most of the cast. Two of the three interlinking plot-lines completely fail and stories of a massive twist are greatly exaggerated. Equally lacking in backstory as the first\\, I still struggled to have any empathy with any of the new characters. Rey's parentage question is short-changed\\, and Snoak's history is still none existent\\, making his demise unimportant. Phasma's lack of screentime continues. If Disney think they are creating the next Boba Fett\\, they are oh so wrong. If I was Christie\\, I'd stay dead and walk away from a third chance to be part of the background. An attempt to make Mark Hamill look younger goes horribly wrong.  My advice is to go see it\\, but go with zero expectations and you may think it OK.","true":true}
