Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest installment in the Star Wars empire continues the refreshing change The Force Awakens brought about to introduce a confident and effective female lead in Daisy Ridley.  Still\\, The Last Jedi lacks the originality of Rogue One.  The Last Jedi is a beautiful film\\, but one viewers may feel they have seen before.","true":true}
