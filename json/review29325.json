Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy did their best to kill Star Wars with this installment. From Cranky Murderous Luke to Leia\u2019s Mary Poppins impression in space to hyperspeed as a weapon. Not to mention the travesty of the wasted half hour on the casino planet to start the film. If you are a true Star Wars fan then you will or at least should hate this movie. This is the first time I\u2019ve been heartbroken by a movie but man Rian did his best to ruin a big part of my childhood. If they ever let Rian Johnson near another Star Wars film I will revolt haha. Do yourself a favor and pretend this movie doesn\u2019t exist.","true":true}
