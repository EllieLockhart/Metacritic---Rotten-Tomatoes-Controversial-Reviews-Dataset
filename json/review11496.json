Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. 'Subverted' expectations by ruining all the setup from the first film and ultimately goes nowhere. Good effects and Kylo + Rey were entertaining but overall the movie was garbage and ruined the SW franchise. Save your money.\\n(I am not an Alt Right Russian Bot).","true":true}
