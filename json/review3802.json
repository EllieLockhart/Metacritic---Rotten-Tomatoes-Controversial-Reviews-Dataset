Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Biggeet kick in the teeth to a fan base i have ever seen. It is that bad there is nothing even to compare it too. This is the benchmark as to how much you can destroy a franchise by completely disrespecting the characters and changing everything about them. In fact they were the exact opposite of what they were and srand for in the original trilogy and every incarnation afterwards. Complete eyeball garbage. I will never pay to watch a Star Wars film ever again.","true":true}
