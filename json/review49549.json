Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow... I thought The Force Awakens was bad... This is quite possibly the worst\\, most poorly written big budget blockbuster I have ever seen. The half star is for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher\\, the only actors who came through this mess with any dignity intact. It's so sad to think this was Carrie's final Star Wars movie (excluding what was pre-filmed for ep IX). If you want to watch a true big studio\\, mega budget train wreck in action\\, this should be your first and last stop.","true":true}
