Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything is wrong within this two and an half hour mess.\\nSupposedly epic scenes ruined by jokes\\, a truly offensive offscreen death\\, an incoherent and inconsistent plot\\, and badly developed characters combine together to give you\\, the viewer\\, one of the worst Star Wars experiences of your entire life.\\n\\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg.\\nWell developed characters who act coherently to their background\\, like Poe Dameron\\, are almost demonized with any reason at all. Promising and interesting secondary characters like Tallie Lintra and Captain Moden Canady are -little spoiler (?)- just killed after a bunch of seconds onscreen to leave room for such a boring subplot (the one involving Finn) you'd hope to have a remote controller to just skip it all.\\n\\nA sidenote: Star Wars setting is not supposed to be politically correct\\, inconsistent\\, and most of all so lacking of coherence even with the last Episode. \\n\\nThis movie is a disgrace.","true":true}
