To say the game is packed with things to do is an understatement.\r\rLeaving aside all the random fun there is a cracking single player focused game with an engaging story\\, wonderfully deep characters and a fun\\, accessible fighting system. The story will have you laughing and crying\\, in a weird organised crime soap opera kind of way. This was my first look at the Yakuza series and I cannot wait to try the next one to find out what Majima and Kazuma get up to next.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
