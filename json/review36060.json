Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes Star Wars in a new needed direction to keep the franchise new and full of surprises. Our protagonists dwelve even deeper into their personal arcs which drives the audience into more interest for the new sequel trilogy. The movie does contain some incredibly dumb and pointless moments but are overcomed by stunning visuals\\, plot twists\\, avoiding a re-write of empire and one of Mark Hamills best live action perfomances  yet.","true":true}
