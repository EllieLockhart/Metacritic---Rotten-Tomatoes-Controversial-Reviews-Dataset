Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die-hard fan of Star Wars since the 70s\\, i never ever thought i would say that but... Episode 8\\, sadly\\, ruined the whole thing for me. Even if Episode 7 was not a masterpiece\\, i still loved it very much because of the new characters such as Snoke\\, Rey\\, Phasma and Finn. \\n\\nAfter seeing Episode 7 i was very excited to see what kind of backgrounds they had\\, their stories\\, connections and such. Well... What a let down it was as\\, in fact\\, they became mostly...nobodies in Episode 8\\, no stories whatsoever\\, no real backgrounds\\, no connections with the viewers\\, no passion\\, no real feelings\\, in fact\\, they became shadows of themselves\\, blend\\, lifeless\\, and mixing that with a ridiculous plot and storyline\\, the whole movie became a mess real quick unfortunately.  We all waited 2 years for that\\, with hopes\\, questions\\, surrounding the mysteries\\, the new characters\\, and the new storylines....Only to be mostly abandoned by the director and Disney. \\n\\nI have no idea why it turns out that way\\, but in the end\\, i was very sad to witness such an amazing saga as Star Wars becoming even worst than Jar Jar era... The more i think about Episode 8... The more i think id prefer to see Jar Jar back again. Ok maybe not but...close. I hope that JJ will bring back Star Wars to us with Episode 9\\, even though i have NO idea how he will be able to do that\\, considering the mess Johnson left behind.","true":true}
