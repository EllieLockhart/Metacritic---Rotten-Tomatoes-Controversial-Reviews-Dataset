Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you go into this film with a view in your head of how it SHOULD go. Of what SHOULD happen then it is highly possible you will be dissapointed. If however you are open to new ideas and a new approach to the space opera then you may well agree with me that the Last Jedi joins Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest films in the saga. The film is full of new ideas new characters and challenges what the core  of Star Wars is and reminds us that heroes can co.e from anywhere at any time-consuming a fantastic message to spread to fans of all ages. Not everything works\\, a d there are a few line deliveries that are far from perfect but these are minor niggles in a film that was exciti g to watch from start to finish. Grumoy old gits need to leave thwir fan theories at the door.","true":true}
