Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The sheer contrast between the \\\"top critics\\\" and general audience rating of this film is evidence enough that so-called \\\"professional\\\" reviewers no longer have any idea what they are talking about. The Last Jedi was not only a monumental disappointment for fans\\, which is becoming increasingly evident from their public reviews. More than that\\, it stands as perhaps the best example of what not to do with a near-incorruptible\\, multi-billion dollar movie franchise. Johnson's vision of Star Wars represents everything that has gone wrong with films today\\, from its dead-end plot lines and meaningless shocks to its palpable attempt to ruin its male heroes with contrived\\, irrational\\, and utterly pointless heroines and their hammy\\, almost zealous overacting. As much as I would like to cut the film some slack\\, I have to rate it as the worst Star Wars film ever made. 1 out of 5 stars for the irony of making a movie about hope\\, while at the same time closing the door on the future of Star Wars. J.J.\\, my deepest sympathies are with you. If you can fix this one\\, I shall buy you lunch!","true":true}
