Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was a clear intention to tarnish the essence of star wars. It is simply no way to explain something so malicious as Luke milking an alien monster\\, along with other absurd moments as completely ignoring the lineage of Rey (what was the main plot from 'the force awakens' when saying: \\\"The Force is strong in my family\\, my father had it\\, I have it\\, my sister has it. You have that power too.\\\")\\, and that ridiculous and weak plot to end any possible theory on Snoke. Not to mention the stupid way in which a Jedi was depicted as a weak soul with more confusion than a teenager succumbing to fear\\, this argument is completely opposite to what a Jedi was meant to represent: spiritual illumination; and not a weak average personality; that was absolutely not what the essence of a Jedi was from its original conception. \\n For me\\, this raises the question if some idiot comes to destroy a movie story important to many people\\, has the right to do it. It's just disrespectful to the star wars fans.","true":true}
