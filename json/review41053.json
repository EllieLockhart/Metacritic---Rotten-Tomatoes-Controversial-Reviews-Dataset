Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie gave some fun twists to the Star Wars saga\\, while still seeming to keep to the mirrored trilogy stylings of the previous instalments.\\n\\nThe characters were fun\\, the visuals breathtaking\\, and the story made for a fun romp from beginning to end. \\n\\nAlso\\, Mark Hamill and old cranky Luke made every scene with him a delight.","true":true}
