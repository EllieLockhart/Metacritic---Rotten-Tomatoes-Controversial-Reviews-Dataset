Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining\\, but not impressive.  Totally screwed up Luke's character\\, all of a sudden he wants to end the Jedi?  Really?  Disney is really allowing these movies to get so screwed up.  Snoke?  Who the F is Snoke?  He's the Supreme Leader\\, with massive power\\, but gets killed too quickly.  I loved Rose\\, but her story line with Finn was such a boring waste of time\\, way to SJW (Rich people are evil).  Laura Derns Character was empty with no real substance.  General Leah should have died in the vacuum of space\\, but magically she can use the force now.  It was entertaining (had I never seen any other Star Wars before)\\,","true":true}
