However the game takes a different approach to the story and that fact alone will result in various different opinions.

Its not a game to make you feel good\\, its a game that will show how awful and beautiful the world of the last of us is. Its main theme is about hatred and the desire for revenge\\, but also about perspective. If you can go on this journey with a open mind you might  experience a very special story that needed to be told. The graphics are among the best the ps4 ever produced\\, the gameplay is vastly improved and does everything the first game was lacking in terms of mechanics. The game's pace can drag on in a couple of parts\\, but overall it's a minor nitpick that does not compromise the experience whatsoever. The sound design is really impressive making the experience really immersive and the music\\, both original and covers\\, are subtle and beautifuland sets the tone really well throughout the journey. Overall an experience that cannot be missed for those who want an different type of story and really well made game overall.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
