Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great continuation of the new saga. I was very pleased with this movie.  Story was a nice change of pace.  Action sequences and practical effects\\, once again\\, allowed me to become immersed in the Star Wars universe.  Character development and progression were well planned and flowed well with the sequence of events depicted in the film.  I had hoped for more information on Snoke\\, but there is still one more film\\, at least\\, to allow for this.  Luke's struggles\\, current and present\\, are consistent with the expanded universe and cannon literature.  Once again I was very pleased with this film.","true":true}
