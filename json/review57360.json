Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made me sign up as an audience reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes. I have been a life long Star Wars fan for thirty-six years. Born and raised next door to Skywalker Ranch\\, ILM\\, Lucasfilm... I was so excited to see this film.\\nThis is not just a bad Star Wars movie\\, this is a Horrible movie in general. The acting throughout the cast is terrible. (With the exception of the character of \\\"Rose\\\") The plot and story are terrible. Terribly written and terribly portrayed. The only surprise that comes to you during the film is that it actually ends. \\nIt is beyond obvious that Kathleen Kennedy and company are pushing for strong female leaders\\, white men are the devil\\, and the beauty of diversity is struggling against white male authority. As a white male myself I could watch that if it was done well\\, as in an artistic\\, well done movie with thought\\, planning\\, writing\\, and special effects to support that story. This film had none of that! They came very close in The Force Awakens. That films subtle humor actually added to the story. They tried over the top humor in this film and it detracted greatly from the saga.\\nIn summary this film is horrible! \\nAs a movie fan\\, it made me want to walk out of the theatre.\\nAs Star Wars fan\\, it made me want to blow my head off.\\nThey should have titled this move \\\"The Phantom Menace 2\\\"","true":true}
