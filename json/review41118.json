Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had so much good and so much potential and it shot all of it in the face. The biggest joke of a scene in a movie was the Leia space flight scene. Now we have a dead Luke and a living Leia (Rest in peace Carrie).\\nHope JJ can pull a miracle out of his ass because Rian Johnson left him with nothing for Episode 9.","true":true}
