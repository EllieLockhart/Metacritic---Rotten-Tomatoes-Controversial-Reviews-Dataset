Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it is a good movie. Great plot all the way through. but I fails on the acting ( not kilo ren he was great ) and scripting. The mood was totally off. The drama is gone. I am not saying it is a bad movie\\,it isn't\\, but it is not the same type movie episodes the originals are. If you are going into this movie for the first time don't expect a star wars movie expect a disney movie with all your favorite characters all squished together. It will make the experience more enjoyable and less jarring. ","true":true}
