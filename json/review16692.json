Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never left a theatre more disgusted with a movie.  The disrespect they paid to the central character of the original trilogy is amazing.   They made Luke a soulless\\, spineless\\, empty vessel of a being.  In Return of the Jedi\\, Luke had brass balls.  In this he's not epitome of nothingness.  He's not even a man.  At least make Luke a man.\\n\\nMovie was visually pretty though so I did give it 1\/2 stars.","true":true}
