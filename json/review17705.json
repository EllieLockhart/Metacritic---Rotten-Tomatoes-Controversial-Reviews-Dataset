Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It does not follow with the original star wars themes or rules if you will.  Characters do things with the force that are not in line with what the previous movies established\\, major jokes are common in the middle of serious scenes\\, and kylo rin is the worst \\\"evil\\\" character they've ever had in all of the star wars.  I was angry by the end of the movie and I am only a casual fan.   93% rating seems like a conspiracy.  I give it a 60% for visual effects only.","true":true}
