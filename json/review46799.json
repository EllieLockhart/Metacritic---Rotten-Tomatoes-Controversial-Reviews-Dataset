Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well... it's better than Force Awakens.\\n\\nFirst the good: \\nMark Hamill gave a great performance as Luke Skywalker\\, the legend with feet of clay. They gave him good material to work with\\, and he made the most of it.\\n\\nFinally some respect for Leia - She's not given too much to do\\, but this character got some much needed and deserved attention. \\n\\nThe cinematography is outstanding. This is a visually beautiful film. The sets and locations just\\,... pop. The action sequences flow well and are easy to follow without appearing overly choreographed. \\n\\nAdam Driver gets his Snape on\\, making Darth Vader wanna-be\\, Kylo Ren sympathetic and interesting\\, a miracle in and of itself.\\n\\nHumor\/heart - parts of the film are genuinely funny...like\\, intentionally. The script gave every character something to work with\\, a chance to develop\\, a reason for the audience to cheer for them\\n\\nNow the stuff that could have been better (No spoilers)\\nThere are several rather large plot holes\\, some big enough to drive a star-destroyer through. Enough said\\, for now.\\n\\nThe three new main characters are completely ineffectual. They\\, literally\\, accomplish nothing that they set out to do. They\\, in fact\\, fail rather spectacularly. This appears to be solely for the sake of developing character arcs. Though refreshing at first\\, it's odd to have a film where the main characters contribute nothing to the resolution of the plot.\\n\\nI wish directors would stop remaking their favorite scenes from the original trilogy. I had a strong sense of deja vu as I watched reshoots of the siege of the rebel base on Hoth\\, the Falcon flying through the death star\\, the attempt to deactivate the tractor beam\\, etc. I'm begging you\\, please\\, give us something new. Do something original. Blow our minds.\\n\\nPenguin dogs - You'll find out. These things are super cute and completely unnecessary. They exist solely to provide Disney with something to merchandise.\\n\\nThe Upshot:\\n\\nThis was good - not great - but definitely worth the price of admission. I\\nhad low expectations after The Force Awakens\\, and that certainly helped\\, but there's stuff in here that deserves applause.","true":true}
