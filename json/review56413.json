Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie\\, along with Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One. A bold movie full of surprises\\, Most of the jokes landed perfectly and a few not as well. \\n\\nGrowing up along with Luke and Star Wars\\, I went in without any preconceived ideas and was taken on an exhilarating ride. It goes to unexpected places and builds up the mythology further. \\n\\nGorgeous cinematography\\, beautiful score\\, excellent sound design and incredible performances from everyone. \\n\\nEven the things people are complaining about\\, are enjoyable when you don't take it as a new author adding his own flourishes to the gospel. It's made by an talented filmmaker and team for entertainment.\\, adding momentum to propel it further into the future. Opening up the franchise to the new generation and releasing it from the bonds of the previous generation. \\n\\nGrowing up with the franchise\\, now my son is joining the new characters on this journey","true":true}
