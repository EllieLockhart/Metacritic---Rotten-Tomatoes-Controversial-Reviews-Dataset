Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The trailer looked great. One of the things I was really interested in seeing was the battle between the walkers and the sleds. I wondered what new way the good guys would find to take out the walkers because I assumed Ryan wouldn't just have them use harpoons and tow cables again. What we got to see was the good guys drive out there-and then just turn around and go back?! Well\\, I guess that did subvert my expectations.\\n\tThe last Jedi is the Matrix 3 of the Star Wars Saga. Knowing the fate of Luke is so grim\\, it stifles the enjoyment of the previous films. I'm much more excited to see Adywan's Return of the Jedi: Revisited than I am the next new Star Wars film. Which is a shame because I did like Force Awakens. JJ has an impossible task to wrap up this derailed train-wreck.","true":true}
