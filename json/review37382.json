Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem is it has a lot of holes in the plot. \\n\\n1.-The First Order can trace the rebels at speed of light\\, but they can\u00b4t reach them at turtle speed? That\u00b4s improbable.\\n2.- Finn cross the Galaxy to find a decoder-hacker in order to bring him to the Firt Order spacecraft...\\,etc. Instead Finn could simply reach the rebels at the border of the galaxy asking for their help.\\n3.- Luke\u00b4s character is pathetic. Most of his scenes he is almost crying. This movie could be the last Luke\u00b4s adventure. Luke\u00b4s character is completely wasted.\\n4.- Leia is not superman (for god\u00b4s sake).\\n5.- Snoke is also a wasted character.\\n6.- Rey can master advanced techniques of the Force without any training and become a Jedi in three days? Not even the chosen one (Anakin Skaywalker) or Yoda could do that.\\n\\nGood special effects and photography. \\n\\nPersonally I lost interest on the next movie. It\u00b4s a shame.","true":true}
