Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The \\\"Star Wars\\\" title alone gave this movie 3 stars. However\\, the characters were written so poorly that I can't in good conscience give it that rating. Luke behaved like Han in this movie and made me sympathetic to the franchise's top villain\\, Kylo Ren. The established  \\\"flirt-mance\\\" between hero leads Rey and Finn was scrapped in favor of a Rey\/Kylo flirt-mance\\, which makes zero sense. While The Force Awakens left several intriguing plot lines unanswered\\, TLJ more or less finished them all off with a collective whimper\\, leaving me curious as to why I spent the last two years anticipating a satisfying resolution. I have no idea where the Star Wars Saga will go from here\\, and I'm not sure I want to know. Major\\, major disappointment.","true":true}
