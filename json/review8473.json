{"101487":121093,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  It was REALLY GOOD.  Ignore the naysayers and critics.  If you're a Star Wars fan\\, you will\\, at the very least\\, enjoy it.  And if you're a fan of some (or most) of the Expanded Universe (EU)\\, then you will definitely feel good about the way it turned out!\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nYOU'VE BEEN WARNED!  TURN BACK NOW\\, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSo\\, my thoughts on some of the major points of contention in the movie:\\n\\n-A little bit of silliness in it\\, especially at the beginning.\\n\\nYes.  There was some.  Especially the bit with Poe teasing Hux.  All I can say is\\, if this upset you\\, you obviously never watched the Prequels\\, The Clone Wars\\, or Rebels.  Those are all MUCH sillier and much more ridiculous.  Disney toned down the silliness quite a bit from where George Lucas brought it.  BUT\\, yes\\, there was a bit of silliness in there\\, and after The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, I'm sure some people were hoping it would be gone for good.  But if the Prequels were a 10 when it came to silliness\\, TLJ is no worse than a 2.  It is not even remotely silly as Jar-Jar\\, 8 year old Annakin blowing up a battle station\\, C3PO having his head swapped with a battldroid\\, or General Greivous.\\n\\n-The Rebel Alliance was buying weapons from the same arms dealers that were making them for the First Order!!!\\n\\nWow.  There's a shocker!  Why\\, it's almost as if there was some sort of civil war going on or something...\\n\\n-There was an SJW message in it!!!!!\\n\\nCongratulations!  You apparently don't know the difference between a Social Justice Warrior and a Libertarian!  Because that was a LIBERTARIAN message!  If you are not referring to the message the Code Breaker gave Fin\\, though\\, perhaps you are referring to the fact that Rose prevented Fin from sacrificing himself and said something about saving the people we love rather than dying for a doomed cause?  Now I'll admit\\, I was kinda hoping Fin would go through with it.  But Rose's actions  were her own\\, based upon the fact that she had just lost her sister for the cause and obviously had strong feelings for Fin.  AND\\, the fact that they were all willing to let Luke sacrifice HIMSELF for the cause more than made up for that!\\n\\n-Kylo Ren is too whiny!\\n\\nAnd Annakin Skywalker wasn't?  That's the whole point.  Be a little bitch and you will turn to the Dark Side!\\n\\n-And\\, finally\\, some people didn't like the direction they took with Luke Skywalker...including Mark Hamil himself.\\n\\nWell\\, if you have read any of the EU\\, then you were fully prepared for this version of Luke Skywalker.  I don't need to tell you about how he went into hiding for fear that he would make the same mistakes Obiwan did if he attempted to train any Jedi on his own\\, or that he feared turning to the Dark Side.  You were prepared for this\\, and you were pleased by the direction they took.\\n\\nIF you are not familiar with the EU\\, then allow me to explain.  Luke was never some noble knight in shining armor that represented the epitome of the Jedi Order.  He longed for adventure.  He ignored his teacher's instructions.  He whined about things being too difficult.  He lied.  And in the end\\, he failed his final test against Darth Vader...the test that Yoda told him would make him a Jedi.\\n\\n\\\"Wait...what?!?!?\\\"\\, you say?\\n\\nHe longed for adventure.  Something Yoda frequently warned him about\\, and something Rey never did (remember\\, she wanted to return to Jakku).  Rey was much more like Obiwan and Yoda than Luke ever was.\\n\\nHe ignored his teacher's instructions.  He went into the Dark Side Cave on Dagobah with his weapons\\, in defiance of Yoda.  There he faced his fear:  that he would be turned the the Dark Side and become a Sith Lord.  Then he ignored Yoda's orders not to abandon his training in an attempt to save his friends in Cloud City.  He did so anyway\\, and to what end?  He didn't save his friends.  Lando did that.  All he did was walk right into Vader's trap and put his friends at risk when they came back for him.  Sure\\, Artoo went with him\\, and it was Artoo who turned the hyperdrive back on on the Falcon.  But had they not been slowed down by having to go back and save Luke\\, the Falcon might have just told 3PO itself that its hyperdrive was turned off.\\n\\nHe whined about things being too difficult.  Well...that's a given.  There would be no infamous\\, \\\"Do.  Or do not.  There is no try.\\\" line if he wasn't frequently whining about things  being too hard during his training.\\n\\nHe lied.  He told Jabba he was a Jedi when he wasn't.  He even asked Yoda later if he was Jedi\\, to which Yoda responded that he had one more test:  to face Vader.  Which brings us to...\\n\\nHe failed his test against Darth Vader.  Oh\\, he saved Vader.  But he tried to strike the Emperor down in anger and hate...EXACTLY how the Emperor wanted him to.  He gave in to the Dark Side.  He failed his test\\, and he did not become a Jedi.  Bet he was also not a Sith.  He was a Grey Jedi.  But that decision to give in to his feelings and strike down his enemy is also what allowed him to save his father\\, and bring him back from the Dark Side.  \\n\\nThe direction they went with Luke in TLJ was exactly the direction they needed to go with him.  Rey\\, not Luke\\, was The Last Jedi.  And her behavior proves that point.  \\n\\nOh\\, and how Luke used what remained of his life force to generate an illusion in order to hold off Kylo Ren and give Rey time to save his friends and allies was awesome.  I wonder how many people realized that it was an illusion from the moment he walked out of the blaster fire?  If that hadn't been indicator enough\\, surely him pulling out his old\\, just destroyed blue light saber would have told them?\\n\\nAnyhow....\\n\\nIn conclusion...\\n\\nThe whining over this movie is nonsense.  It was a great movie.  Any Star Wars fan will enjoy it!","true":true}
