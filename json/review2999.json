Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Badly written\\, poor dialouge\\, implausible ridiculous plot points\\, obvious continuity errors\\, lots of dumb unnecessary CGI creatures\\, silly in stead of exhilarating. I'm shocked so many critics are saying they thought it was great?! Possibly we didn't see the same movie.","true":true}
