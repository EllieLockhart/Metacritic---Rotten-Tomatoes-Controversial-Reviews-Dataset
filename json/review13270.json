Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why the critics are giving this movie good reviews\\, unless they were paid off. The writing and storytelling are terrible. The dialogue is bad. The tone and pacing of the movie are off. The one-liners and jokes aren't funny. The plot doesn't make any sense and is full of holes. There are too many characters we don't care about\\, too many unnecessary subplots that go nowhere\\, too many unbelievable plot devices. Luke's character isn't handled well and his relationship with Rey isn't developed in an interesting way. The entire subplot with Finn and Rose is pointless. It's just a terrible movie. This is coming from a long-time Star Wars fan.","true":true}
