Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story line unfolds and unfolds and unfolds and goes. . .no where.  After A Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, HOW could they mess this up so badly?  I've followed Star Wars since the beginning.  Most of the movies (including this one) I first saw around midnight for the opening show.  I LOVE STAR WARS!!!  But The Last Jedi\\, except for a few good scenes\\, is just boring to watch\\, sometimes even painful.","true":true}
