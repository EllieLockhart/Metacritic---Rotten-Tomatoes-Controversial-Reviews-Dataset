Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw it\\, and wasn't impressed.  Yes its better than the Jar Jar plagued \\\"Phantom Menace\\\"\\, and probably better then \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" whitch came across as a blander redundant version of \\\"a New Hope\\\"\\nBut its far from good\\, nowhere near as good as the original trilogy\\, or Rogue One\\, and not even as good as episodes 2 or 3. its riddled with problems from the main threat getting killed off so now we have a temper tantrum throwing teenager who we already know can easily be beaten by the new hero Rey as the primary threat.\\nRey went for training from Luke  received none but magicly knows how to be a jedi?  \\nThen theres \\\"Admiral hunger games hair\\\"  dont even remember her real name but the whole side story about finn and the casino and poe taking over the ship could have been avoided simply by her explaining the plan!\\nAnd luke giving up on everything?  When force awakens ended we all hoped luke was there to train in solitude\\, to learn from his mistakes instead hes a hermit whos given up on life.\\nAnd of course theres the underlining theme of feminisim in whitch every man in the movie is treated like a idiot\\nHell one of the more potentially great moments of the film was botched when fin\\, finally overcoming his cowardice could have sacrificed himself to save the rebels\\, but in standard Disney fashion the good guys never die and how the hell did they get back inside when they were literally feet from the enemy?  Snuck around behind luke?\\nAnd why the hell did luke die?  Sure he'd be exhausted but it felt like he was letting go on life not that he'd just sacrificed himself like it was a heroic sacrifice as it may have been if he had actually showed up\\, heck Kylo killing luke may have made him a real threat rather than the bumbling child he came across as...\\nI can't belive I'm saying this but I dont think I'll go see the next movie in theaters\\, I'll go back to reading the original expanded universe instead","true":true}
