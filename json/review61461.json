We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I think the low rating is related to the extremely high expectations from this sequel. If you leave the story aspect aside\\, which is indeed the weakest aspect here\\, then as a stand-alone game it is quite good. It is almost the same gameplay as in the previous one with some improvements\\, so if you liked the first you should be good with this one as well.

The problem in the gameplay\\, however\\, is that it does get repetitive after a while. And since this game is longer than the previous\\, at some point it does get tedious.\rSo\\,\rGraphics - 10\/10 - The game looks amazing as you could expect\\, the animations both in the cut scenes and the in-game are great.\r\rSound - 10\/10 - Great ambient sounds which gets you into the atmosphere\\, weapon shots and reloads sound amazing.\r\rVoice Acting 10\/10 - As you expect from Naughty Dog\\, always deliver a perfect voice acting\\, all voice talents did an amazing job here.\r\rSoundtrack - 10\/10 - Music which gets you into the atmosphere perfectly.\r\rGameplay - 8\/10 - Enjoyable\\, a bit improved from the previous game\\, but gets repetitive after about 70% of the game.\r\rStory - 3\/10 - Well\\, it is bad. Really really bad. Not only it is not interesting\\, especially the second half of the game\\, some of the character's choices which affect the story\\, does not make to much sense.\r\rOverall I really enjoyed this game\\, but was very disappointed from the story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
