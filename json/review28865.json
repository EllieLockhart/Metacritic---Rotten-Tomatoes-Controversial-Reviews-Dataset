Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really a slow speed chase!  That is what I paid money to see\\, I don't think so. Terrible side story with Canto casino\\, it had no bearing on the plot and didn't grow the characters involved. Destroyed the Luke character\\, the one who saw good in Darth Vader\\, by having him turn his back on everything.  Finn\\, Rey and Poe should have had some character building together\\, but I guess Rian Johnson just wanted to tear down the characters we loved... Let the past die. Nope\\, without the past we have no present and definitely no future. The only good scenes are visually; the throne room fight and Holdo's kamikaze plan.  Just don't watch this if you love Star Wars\\, it is definitely the worst thought out plot and is hostile towards existing fans without attracting new fans.","true":true}
