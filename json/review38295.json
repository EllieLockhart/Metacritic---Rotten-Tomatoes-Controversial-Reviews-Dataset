Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst depiction of Luke sky walkers character\\, I feel for mark hammil.\\nRey gets zero base on how or why she's such a skilled fighter and force user.\\nThe whole movie is based on plot holes and cuts away from any and all interesting ideas started from the force awakens.\\nIt's just a poorly made fan flick.","true":true}
