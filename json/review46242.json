{"101487":193263,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning: This review contains spoilers.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a film which desperately tried to break the Star Wars mold and upend old traditions to create a new type of Star Wars movie.  In some areas it succeeded in doing so\\, but those changes were not for the better.  In other areas\\, this was very much a Star Wars film\\, but one more reminiscent of the prequels than of the original trilogy.\\n\\nTo start with the good\\, the film looks great.  The filmography is sound\\, the sfx are great\\, and the musical score is outstanding.  There are individual scenes that are also excellent\\, and seem as though they were ripped from a different movie.  Many of the scenes with Kylo Ren and Rey\\, for example\\, stand above the rest of the film in terms of quality.\\n\\nHowever\\, the few good things about this film are completely overshadowed by the bad.  The story itself is jumpy and confused\\, and it's hard to tell what the actual plot is (to the extent that there is one).  The entire Resistance storyline is less a thrilling war against the First Order\\, and more a slow motion police chase in space that manages to go on for nearly the entire run time of the film.  Finn\\, Poe\\, and Rose are completely mis-utilized.  Poe exists only to butt heads with General Leia and her new counterpart (played by Laura Dern)\\, but otherwise does little of note other than to stage a failed and pointless coup aboard the ship.  Finn and Rose go on a wild goose chase in pursuit of a codebreaker\\, which involves some of the worst scenes in any Star Wars movie.  A wacky nighttime escape from a casino on large cartoon rabbits seemed worthy of a Benny Hill soundtrack\\, and was more in line with something we would have seen in the prequels than in a modern Star Wars film.  Much like Poe's adventures\\, theirs ends in failure\\, but not the grave\\, dramatic types of failures that we saw in a movie like Rogue One.  This failure was entirely pointless\\, born not of the pride of the heroes\\, but instead\\, their utter stupidity and a lack of normal communication.\\n\\nOne of the most bizarre scenes involved the destruction of the bridge on the Resistance flagship\\, which killed (offscreen) fan favorite Admiral Ackbar\\, and sent Leia careening into space.  In what many are now referring to as the \\\"Mary Poppins\\\" scene\\, Leia opens here eyes\\, lifts her finger\\, and floats back towards her ship\\, into the safety of an airlock.  It was a jarring scene\\, one which caused most of the audience in my showing to burst out in laughter\\, which I'm guessing is not the reaction that was intended.  In the end\\, the Resistance storyline probably should have been scrapped and re-written entirely.\\n\\nThe storyline involving Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren is of better quality\\, but also made seemingly bizarre choices in it's storytelling.  Much like the casino chase\\, our time with Luke often seems reminiscent of something from the prequels\\, featuring him tossing his father's lightsaber over his shoulder for a gag laugh (ruining entirely the suspense built at the end of the Force Awakens)\\, spear hunting fish in the most convoluted way possible\\, and\\, in one of the most disgusting scenes in the series\\, milking a large\\, four titted alien sea cow and slurping noisily from the bottle.  Luke's character continued to be misused throughout the rest of the film\\, which makes us wonder if perhaps Mark Hamill was right to express concerns over the direction that was taken with his character.  If the movie wanted to take Skywalker away from the hero archetype\\, perhaps it would have been served by spending more time with him agonizing over his past choices and the nature of the force\\, instead of showing us where he get's his daily calcium.  His death was equally perplexing\\, the anticlimax of a grand story that has been building since 1977.  \\n\\nRey's storyline with Ren was the most intriguing part of the film\\, teasing a close connection between the two and indicating that one or the other might end up switching sides.  However\\, the end state of the movie is much the same as it began\\, with Ren on a homicidal campaign against the Resistance and Rey the all powerful hero of the good guys.  A perplexing decision was made in the brief life (and death) of supreme leader Snoke\\, a character responsible for the downfall of the New Republic and the destruction of Luke's new Jedi order\\, who was given mere minutes of screen time before being summarily killed off with no backstory or development.\\n\\nOn the whole\\, the film stands shoulder to shoulder with the prequels\\, or perhaps among the latest of the Transformers series.  Visually appealing\\, exciting\\, at times funny\\, but with little substance.","true":true}
