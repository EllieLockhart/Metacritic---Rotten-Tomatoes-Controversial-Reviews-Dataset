Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should have been titled \\\"A Progressive Space Opera for millennials\\\". It was certainly marketed as a Starwars film. A simple chase scene of attrition. Familiar beloved characters were eliminated. A nonsense subplot with hints of social awareness towards greed and injustice\\, casino scene anyone? It made no sense in this movie and it was \\\"forced\\\" in. Spare me the liberal hypocrisy while you dine in your red carpets and devour on caviar Hollywood! I don't believe the hype.  Rogue One was a far better movie. The \\\"last real\\\" StarWars movie.","true":true}
