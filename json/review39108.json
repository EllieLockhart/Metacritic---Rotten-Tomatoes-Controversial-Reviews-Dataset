Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this crap made even less sense than the last one and killed any character growth that was already established not to mention pointless scenes and characters compelling devoid of any reason to be except serving one purpose to explain some bs in the plot. Horrible fighting scenes\\, even Phantom Menace managed to capture epic sabre battle\\, this one was pure garbage and pointless. The space battles held almost no sense at all (why didn't they do the last manoeuvre straight away???) not to mention super hero taking on the entire fleet by himself\\, awful presentation of last trilogy main character that had no sense whatsoever... Boy I could go on all day. This franchise needs to die\\, panders to very\\, very\\, cheap comedy laughs and more pointless special effects hungry kids. Check the reviews on imdb\\, this is utter dumpster.","true":true}
