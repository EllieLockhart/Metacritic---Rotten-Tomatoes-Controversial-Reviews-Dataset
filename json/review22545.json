Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's get the positives out of the way and the reason it doesn't deserve the lowest score : The visuals are spectacular\\, there is excellent cinematography\\, the music is outstanding.\\n\\nLet's now focus on why it's only a 2\/5 : The writing for this movie is absolutely awful. It is filled with lazy writing\\, plot holes and nonsensical moments. All the existing characters got ruined\\, the new ones were awful. \\\"Nothing\\\" is the best word to describe what we get. A boring side story that should be a filler episode for a TV-show that results in nothing. Rey's parents were no one. Snoke is nothing. \\n\\nThis movie is great for people who like nice visuals. It's an insult for any Star Wars fan\\, and an insult for anyone who enjoys good story telling.","true":true}
