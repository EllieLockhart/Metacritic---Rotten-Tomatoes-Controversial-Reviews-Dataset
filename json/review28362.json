Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly my favorite starwars movie yet.  For those complaining about canon\\, nothing in this movie breaks canon.  If the issue is that there are previously unseen Force powers\\, that can easily be explaining by the passing away of the strict rules of the Jedi order.  Luke's character was fine.  He had been through so much\\, you don't know how he would have reacted.\\n\\nIt does not destroy anything force awakens set up.  Just your theories\\, get over yourself. Besides\\, even if it did let's not forget the romance between Leia and Luke bring set up in episode 4 and 5.\\n\\nGreat movie and I will definitely be looking forward to the next.","true":true}
