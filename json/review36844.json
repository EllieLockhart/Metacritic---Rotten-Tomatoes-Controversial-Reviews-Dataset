Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a cinematic masterpiece\\, in terms of pacing\\, action sequences\\, and suspense.  It was however\\, the biggest Star Wars let down imaginable.  It was as though Rian Johnson\\, the director of this movie had virtually no interest in the characters and general story arc created by J.J. Abrams.  Johnson basically just decided to clean house and dispatch any characters he wasn't thrilled with and completely ruined the store.  The worst part is the most intangible piece of the puzzle.  J.J. Abrams is set to direct the next film\\, yet his characters are either dead or have pivoted away from their original creation.  This was the biggest F U conceivable.","true":true}
