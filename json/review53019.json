Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, appalling. As a Star Wars movie\\, absolutely disasterous. Zero suspense (the horse escape in the Casino planet was akin to the barrel escape scene in Hobbit)\\, zero character development (I literally don't care if Finn\\, Rose or Poe live or die)\\, and zero respect paid to the mythos\\, consistency and icons of the series. \\n\\nThis is the beginning of the end for the franchise\\, I am sure of it.","true":true}
