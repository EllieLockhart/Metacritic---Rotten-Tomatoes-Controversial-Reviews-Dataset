Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Down with Disney for what they have done to Star Wars! Not only have they destroyed Star Wars\\, they have destroyed the desire to see films if this is what people have to look forward to--the abject destruction of hope and one's heroes to make way for Mary Sue. LUKE DESERVED BETTER--WE ALL DESERVED BETTER! This is only getting half a star since zero stars is not an option!","true":true}
