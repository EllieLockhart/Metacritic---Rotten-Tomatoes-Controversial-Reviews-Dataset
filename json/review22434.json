Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left the cinema disappointed with how the characters were treated\\, Kylo Ren was the only character that felt like they matched and progressed from their appearance in episode 7. the plot is disjointed and opens alot of B and C plots that server no purpose\\, too many plot holes. visually there are some excellent shots...the hyper space scene . Excited to see how this story will fit into the saga once the next instalment drops","true":true}
