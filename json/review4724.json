Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely destroys the \\\"magic\\\" of Star Wars\\, and I suppose it was intentional. Was completely a focus group tested movie to appeal to a different audience while no longer considering the fans\\, Mark Hamill himself lamented in an interview that the director did not consider the fans when making the movie\\, only on making \\\"his\\\" own story that spites the originals. This movie is soulless\\, and the director didn't even work with the last director(abrams) on continuity\\, Kylo Ren had his scar moved not because of aesthetics but because the directors had no communications with each other beyond relative plot points and what characters not to use in the movies(IE\\, don't use luke or snoke in force awakens and don't use Han Solo in The Last Jedi). This movie felt like watching a lame transformers movie again\\, but I doubt it will do as well in China as those do. 2 Stars for production and sound quality\\, and that's being generous.","true":true}
