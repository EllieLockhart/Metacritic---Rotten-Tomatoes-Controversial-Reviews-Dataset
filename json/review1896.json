Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from what I suspect is some harsh editing for time constraints\\, I loved it. Fellow fan boys and girls need to stop rating Star Wars movies when they are still smarting over their two years of obsessive theorizing being for nothing. They'll see it three more times\\, and realize it's actually fantastic. Hopefully\\, they will update their ratings then.","true":true}
