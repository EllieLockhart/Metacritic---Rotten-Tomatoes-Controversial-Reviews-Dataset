Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This doesn't deserve to be in the Star Wars franchise. It makes no sense and the sub plots bring nothing but political bias to the unimaginative story. I tried to watch it again but made me cringe even more. RIP Star Wars","true":true}
