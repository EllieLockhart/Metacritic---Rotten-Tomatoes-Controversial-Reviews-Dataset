Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is a great addition to the franchise. its similar to empire strikes back\\, but different enough to feel like its own movie. that does not mean its without flaws. this movie dedicates a lot of screen time to side characters and some answers from puzzles of the force awakens are frustrating\\, but that does not make it a bad movie. some flaws\\, still great addition.","true":true}
