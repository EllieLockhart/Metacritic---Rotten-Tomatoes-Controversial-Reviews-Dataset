Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I call upon all 1 star reviewers to watch it a second time now that your preconceived notions have been obliterated. I hated it on opening night\\, was about to rate it one star but decided to give it a second look anyway...and now\\, with all expectations cleared away\\, I saw what the non-Star Wars fan critics saw - it was a much more enjoyable experience with a clear head and from a different point of view.","true":true}
