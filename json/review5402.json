Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite having a collection of over 3000 movies I rarely post a review on movie sites...but this movie deserves its increasingly poor rating.\\n\\nThe cinematography is excellent\\, as is the score\\, the fight choreography and the effects...but the story is a mess. Juvenile humour that is jarringly out of place for a Star Wars movie\\, \\\"world mechanics\\\" that are internally contradictory\\, repeated middle fingers to significant events in the Force Awakens (which made the rebooted franchise fun to watch)\\, the list goes on and on.\\n\\nI'm not even hating on the movie for it's blatant political messages or gender and racial biases.\\n\\nThis movie is not a Star Wars story\\, because it gives middle fingers to plot points from the original movies that started the franchise.\\n\\nIf all someone has to do is fly a starship into an enemy at lightspeed\\, why the hell did the rebels sacrifice most of their best pilots in a new hope on a million to one chance that someone could drop a photon torpedo down the thermal exhaust port?\\n\\nLight-speed through the death star...problem solved with one death. Luke Skywalker wasn't needed. At all.\\n\\nWhich is the basic point of why this entire movie is not a Star Wars story...Skywalker is unnecessary. The past is meaningless and insignificant. Giving middle fingers to past episodes by belittling amazing plot points is not \\\"innovative\\, bold and fresh\\\" storytelling; it is not \\\"growth and revitalization\\\" of a franchise. It's lazy and disrespectful deconstruction of previously brilliant\\, original\\, inspired movie-making!\\n\\nRian Johnson should be ashamed that he wrote and filmed this. He is now as dead to me as Brett Ratner since X-men 3.\\n\\nDear Kathleen Kennedy. I will never pay for another Disney-Wars movie. I am infinitely grateful I saw this for free at a sponsored screening. \\n\\nCosmic irony that Spaceballs celebrated its 30th anniversary of release this year.\\n\\nMy disappointment has rarely been so profound.\\n\\nThe 1.5 stars are for John Williams\\, the effects guys\\, the fight choreographers\\, and the unfortunate actors and crew that were contractually obligated to make this stinker. The studios\\, writers\\, producers and directors get 0 stars.","true":true}
