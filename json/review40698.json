Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This latest addition to the Star Wars genre felt a little snarkier than the others\\, and there seemed to be an awful lot of occasions where various characters ended up saying \\\"we have to buy them some more time!\\\"  I was disappointed with what seemed to be some pandering to a teenage idealistic audience such as when Po goes rogue and countermands the Vice Admiral - and gets away with it without anyone  so much as raising an eyebrow.  Nice rebel-against-authority fantasy\\, but as it happens it was a mistake.  There were just some really illogical scenarios and unimaginative story lines.  The best scenario was possibly on the mining planet where the Rebel Alliance (what's left of them) retreats to with the entire First Order on their tail.  The visually stunning red soil under the white salt crust was gorgeous\\, and really imaginative.  Otherwise the movie was a big \\\"meh\\\" for me.","true":true}
