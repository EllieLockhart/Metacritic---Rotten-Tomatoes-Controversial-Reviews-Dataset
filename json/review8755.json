Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For a runtime of close to 156 minutes the film still felt it crammed a lot in. Which of course means is worth several viewings to fully dissect and digest. \\n\\nI saw the headline of a review the other day that said it was unpredictable and I'm pleased to say it was and probably sums the film up best!","true":true}
