Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are whining Bout the most ridiculous things. this was a good movie\\, plain and simple. Too many people being over critical because the story didn't go the way they thought it should\\, which doesn't make a movie bad.","true":true}
