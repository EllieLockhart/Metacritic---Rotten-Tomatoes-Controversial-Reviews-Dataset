Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie put the nail in the coffin for this franchise\\, disney only want to make money and not do fan service to star war fans.\\n\\nThe public have to stop falling for this\\, and supporting these overhyped star war fans that are not good at all","true":true}
