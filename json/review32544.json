Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi does not honors the saga's rich legacy\\, ignores the events from previous movies and destroy the well known characters. The movie is filled with plot holes\\, the new director tried to go in new direction ignoring the previous movie and the twists that went in unexpected directions end up terribly disappointing. Only thing good in this movie is cinematography and a a glimpse of an old beloved character\\, but in the end this is not the Star Wars you're looking for.","true":true}
