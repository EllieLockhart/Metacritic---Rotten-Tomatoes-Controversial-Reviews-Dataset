Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just a badly put together movie. Plot holes\\, redundant story lines\\, forced humour and woeful storyline management of arguable the most important character in movie history. Watching it on mute\\, could be of some help.","true":true}
