Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a fantastic next step into a new and original direction for the franchise. While no movie is perfect\\, and bo Star Wars film is perfect\\, th Last Jedi marks a change away from nostalgia pandering\\, and towards using new and old characters to tell compelling NEW stories in a galaxy far far away. It is delightfully unexpected story that will be remembered for some time to come.","true":true}
