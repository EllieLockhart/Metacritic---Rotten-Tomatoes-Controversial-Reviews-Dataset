Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was simply amazing. It took me a second time watching it to realize how truly great it is. Possibly the best Star Wars movie ever made and I've never gotten so many chills while watching a movie.","true":true}
