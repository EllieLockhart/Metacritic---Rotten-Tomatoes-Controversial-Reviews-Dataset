Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was let down by this movie to say the least. It was kind of entertaining\\, but tried to be funny a lot and failed to and I wasn\u2019t a fan of how they can communicate no matter where they are by telepathy. It really ended my interest in the franchise. Force Awakens was good\\, this one was not.","true":true}
