Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible. For starters it focuses too much on pointless characters who are extremely useless to the overall plot. The movie depicts Luke Skywalker as something George Lucas would have never made him out be. Rose is probably the worst Star Wars character ever\\, even Jar-Jar Binks was better. They focus on things that shouldn't have focused on and the movie has only one scene worth watching again. Rian Johnson should never be allowed to direct another film ever again. Movie was poop","true":true}
