Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" Average. The movie had some great parts but it kind of seemed like nothing really happened. \u201cForce Awakens\u201d was much better. And definitely did not take advantage of utilizing Luke Skywalker (although his fight scene was pretty great)","true":true}
