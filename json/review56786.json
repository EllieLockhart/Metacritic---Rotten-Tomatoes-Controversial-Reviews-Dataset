Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only star was filn that 30min into the movie I wanted to walk out....Came to a point where\\, I didn't care at all about the fate of any of the characters. Jokes everywhere\\, dumb jokes\\, plotlines everywhere that had no point at all\\,characters that looked and where called like such characters but aparentely suffered some disorder that completely changed their personalities\\, only Rey and Kylo remained like them\\, the rest... dont know who those people where..... Phasma... I mean Phasma its this Trilogy version of click bait\\, like less of 2min of screen time\\, not to mention tha was very easy to kill\\, another thing\\, KK screams this movie has feminism all over\\, and no\\, it doesn't\\, the only character that could be described as strong\\, intelligent and fierce is ray... the rest.... pointles\\, as important as a red shirt on the original star trek. Not to mention that those other female characters were written almost like that awful cliche of the anoying wife\\, that cheap tv series use all the time.","true":true}
