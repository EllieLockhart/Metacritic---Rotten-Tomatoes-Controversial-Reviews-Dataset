Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst film in the history of the universe.  Johnson is the worst filmmaker since cave drawings were a thing.  This movie needs a full retcon.  The critics are out of touch.  The audience knows what we like\\, and this isn't it.","true":true}
