Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beyond awful. I kind you not I would have had more fun watching the Home Shopping Network selling \\\"Hello Kitty\\\" watches for 2 hours than I had watching this film. Not entertaining\\, not exciting\\, not even logical. It gave me a headache.","true":true}
