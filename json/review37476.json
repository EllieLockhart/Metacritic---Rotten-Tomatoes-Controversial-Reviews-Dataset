{"101487":178243,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to be. Spoilers ahead \\n\\n\\n\\nThe opening sequence with Poe is good but the chat humor between him and Hux felt out of place. Seems like Disney likes putting humor during serious moments like in marvel movies . And then the scene where Le\u00eda \\\"dies \\\" in space and then comes back to life and flies like Superman back into the ship felt cheap and was dumb . That moment could've been the perfect send off for her character since the actor died but I guess not. Now the visuals and the music were great and the character of Kylo Ren was great also and he really developed as a character in this movie. And it's safe to say Kylo is the most complex and interesting character right now. Rey on the other hand is the most bland character now\\, her parents turned out to be nobodies who sold her off for drinks\\, and we have no explanation of why she is so powerful in the force. Jj Abrams was setting up various plot lines in ep 7 like for example Rey's parents and who Snoke is and various others but they're all thrown in the trash in this movie. Luke Skywalkers character has been utterly destroyed in this film. One night he decides to go crazy just because Ben solo had a bit of the dark side rising within him and he decided to kill him . Also the reason he went to the island was just to die ? In ep 7 it was being hyped up because le\u00eda said he was looking for the last Jedi temple. I guess this new director never watched ep 7. Also Luke never really trains Rey\\, he gives her like 1 lesson and she magically masters the force like it's nothing . And the worst part of the movie was Snoke. Snoke was so hyped up in 7 and now we finally see him\\, and this guy is super powerful \\, he has omnipotent power and can see Rey's and Kylos feelings and thoughts\\, he connected both of them through galaxys. But that power gets him nowhere he gets killed by Kylo while he is sitting down because he didn't see Kylo moving the lightsaber with the force. If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about . How can a guy with omnipotent power not sense or hear a rusty lightsaber moving next to him ? It doesn't make sense\\, Snoke dies and Kylo becomes supreme leader. Also we never got to see Kylo complete his training\\, and Rey didn't train either but both are some of the most powerful force wielders in the universe \\, I call bullshit. Oh did I forget to mention admiral Ackbar does nothing and gets killed and nobody gave a shit? Then the 45 minutes of Finn and Rose felt dragged on and the whole subplot with Finn and Rose was horrendous. The whole thing could've been avoided if Admiral ( I forgot her name) just told Poe her plan \\, then Finn and Rose wouldn't have had to go to the casino. Captain Phasma dies after doing nothing again. And Luke dies at the end after sending a force clone to face Kylo Ren\\, I guess he got to tired from doing that and he passed and became one with the force. All Luke did in this movie was stay at an island and not do anything . I thought the last part when Luke appeared to save the rebellion was gonna save this horrible movie by at least giving us an awesome scene with Luke but no Luke was there as a ghost only. Oh and Yoda appears to talk to Luke which was one of the good parts I forgot to mention . I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I love all the movies even the prequels which everyone hates but this movie is just bad. It doesn't feel like Star Wars and it's easily the worst in the franchise\\, if you get past the fanboy mentality when watching this movie and you really take everything in you'll realize there's many many things horribly wrong with it. Oh FYI there's no lightsaber fight in this movie\\, and I didn't even mention more of the shitty stuff because I'm tired of writing. Go watch this movie so you can see how bad it is. Jar jar had more development than Snoke lmaon\\, Ep 1 is better than this shit.","true":true}
