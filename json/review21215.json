Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the movie last night and I found a more based plot than Force Awakens. Not too much attached to the older movies but very 'pass the torch' one. The art is very innovative and the plot details more rounded. Liked it.","true":true}
