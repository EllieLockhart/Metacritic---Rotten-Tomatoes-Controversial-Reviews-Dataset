Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay I'm seriously the biggest Star Wars fan. I was born in 77 and grew up with these movies. I loved EP7 and had high hopes. Don't waste your time. Disney has ruined my childhood. Too much humor\\, bad acting\\, horrid screen transitions. I can't even go into my Star Wars room as I'm still nauseous. Save your money and go out to dinner.","true":true}
