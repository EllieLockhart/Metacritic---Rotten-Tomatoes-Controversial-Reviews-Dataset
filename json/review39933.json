Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easiest the best film in Star Wars Cannon. Never before have we seen our heroes ... and villians... and everything in between so well flushed out. We get insight into their and this universe's psychology\\, which all previous films failed to provide. Sure that was fine for their time\\, but its a pleasure to see this film updated for 2017.  What will happen in the 3rd film? Well after \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" all bets are off. Fingers crossed JJ takes Rian's lead and provide much more than the same.","true":true}
