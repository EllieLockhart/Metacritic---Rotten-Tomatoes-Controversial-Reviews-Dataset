Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was this movie perfect? No. But what is? Godfather? Apocalypse Now? Maybe. This is a space opera in the continuing saga of religious zealots and space cowboys in a galaxy far far away. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I cheered\\, and I relished in its glory. Was it too similar to Empire? Not at all which I think is it\u2019s best quality. Force Awakens needed to be similar to Ep 4 to instill trust back to the fan base. Rian Johnson did something special with this one. He made a hell of a sci-fi flick without pandering to the core audience. Trust me. What JJ gives us in 2 years time...will not be anywhere as original or ballsy as this one. It will be watered down\\, bland\\, boring and predictable. Kind of like Force Awakens. From one nerd to another. Pull your head out of your butts and understand...this is not a bad movie. Justice League is a bad movie. Downright awful. This is far better then is predecessor and will go down as the best in the new trilogy. Unless JJ surprises me...which I doubt. ","true":true}
