Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan my entire life. I have never felt compelled to write a review of a movie as this is the first time in my life if written a review. That being said I can't even find the words to explain how much I disliked the last Jedi. I liked the force awakens\\, and rouge one so I am definitely not against the new generation of Star Wars. The last Jedi has taken Star Wars in the wrong direction I was so dissatisfied leaving the theatre I'm still in shock. Everybody is entitled to there own opinion but I believe I speak for the majority of fans that they really screwed this one up. I just really hope they learn from this and come back with something better in the future. Again I felt compelled to write this review due to my immediate dissatisfaction of watching the last Jedi. Help us George Lucas your our only hope!!!!","true":true}
