Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was complete garbage and they have taken the needed steps to ruin Star Wars forever. This was so bad I signed a petition at change.org to remove the last jedi from the official canon. i have the same complaints as most other star wars fans. They Ruined Luke Skywalker character. the stories told in force awakens didn't carry over and as a result left me with no resolution to the problems from the first one. Fin and Rose story line was pointless and made no difference. Leia\\, Rose and Fin should of been martyrs or killed off to make story dramatic. Holdo's secret escape plan was secret for no reason. Chase scene in space was worst then watching paint dry. Killed the most Snoke in a lame way. etc... list goes on.","true":true}
