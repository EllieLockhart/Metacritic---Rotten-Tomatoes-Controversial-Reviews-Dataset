Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When you can't tell the difference if you're watching The Guardians of the Galaxy or SW\\, when the humor is so forced\\, when you have no answers to the big questions of precedent movies and finally\\, when the plot is so weak\\, you wish George Lucas directed the film (JarJarBinks included). Huge disappointment.","true":true}
