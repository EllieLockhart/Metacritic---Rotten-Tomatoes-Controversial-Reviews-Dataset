{"101487":175043,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi  for the most part\\, but it was a mixed bag type of movie. There were good parts\\, there bad parts\\, there were bits where I was just like what\\, why? And others that felt like filler. 4.5 stars.","true":true}
