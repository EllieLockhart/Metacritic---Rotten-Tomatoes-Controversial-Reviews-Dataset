{"101487":153405,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"May The Force be with you.\\\"\\n\\nI have some Star Wars apparels in my wardrobe and lightsabers do appeal me but let me tell you upfront\\, I am not an erudite Star Wars pedagogue. Yet it will not cause harm to anyone if I call myself a fan of the franchise. I have only seen the Star Wars movie and not gone deep in its universe with books\\, comics and novels. As my metier is writing film reviews\\, I could not help myself but do a write-up about the year's biggest release.\\n\\nNeedless to say\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is not what the fans expected it to be. Some were disappointed where as some went as far as stating that The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars movie. This divisiveness about the film is clearly evident with critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes which is a solid 93% positive as of now and its audience score is the lowest among the other movies of the Saga with 56% positive score which keeps plummeting. Why such a polarizing reaction?\\n\\n*Major spoilers ahead*\\n\\nThe Last Jedi\\, in my opinion\\, is certainly a good\\, entertaining film with high rewatch value with just the right amount of storyline\\, action sequences and comical relief. The main reason behind the criticism is Rian Johnson and his vision about the film. But I do not think he fell short at doing his job anywhere. The Last Jedi is not a typical Star Wars film with lightsaber duels and a Death Star. We all know The Force Awakens relied heavily on these two factors and other things that made the Original Trilogy a hit and was really old-fashioned. A lot of parallels can be drawn between The Force Awakens and A New Hope. The Last Jedi\\, on the other hand\\, is a lot different than the others in terms of concept and storytelling. The Last Jedi is a bold move by Rian Johnson which gives us something fresh off of a franchise so old. Many wanted The Last Jedi to stick to the classical elements of the film but I say\\, where is the fun in that? Change is inevitable. And Rian Johnson brings in a positive one. Every time\\, we do not need to have a shocking lineage revelation (talking about Rey which could still change in Episode IX) or a lightsaber duel between the protagonist and the antagonist. Despite this experimental mania that I support\\, The Last Jedi has some major flaws.\\n\\nIn one of the battle scenes\\, Princess Leia gets sucked into the vacuum due to an explosion. Then in some way\\, she manages to get back to her ship. At that moment\\, I just wanted to scream like Han Solo does in Finn's face in The Force Awakens\\, \\\"That's not how The Force works!\\\" Other perplexing thing about The Last Jedi is: Who is the big baddie here? Snoke? Kylo Ren? Since Snoke got split into two\\, it is certainly Kylo Ren now but he is no good as a villain. Adam Driver is one hell of a fine actor\\, but Kylo Ren's character is thin. He is this angry\\, whiny boy who throws tantrums and he himself doesn't know what he is doing (same problems we had with Anakin Skywalker in the Prequel Trilogy). It is just like Snoke said- he is nothing like Darth Vader. Talking about Snoke\\, I am okay with him being killed off but there were so many questions about his true identity that are left unanswered. Some crazy fan theories went on saying he is Mace Windu but we really deserve a proper answer to that question. Who was he? Where did he came from? How did he become so powerful and established The First Order? Other than that\\, when Finn and Rose go to Cantonica to find the hacker (& that was Justin Theroux in a surprising cameo by the way)\\, that part seemed really disjoint and a case of messy editing. Felt like switching to Harry Potter Universe all of a sudden also. And oh\\, did Rey being trained by Luke Skywalker really need to be such a short affair?\\n\\nThe Last Jedi takes off on a very good note with an intense space battle\\, hits some turbulence due to plot holes midway but lands us with an excellent climax. The wide shot of Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker in a standoff is just magnificent. Visuals are stunning and space battles full of action that will engage you.  The whole Crait planet sequence was shot deftly\\, acted out very well and had us on the edge of our seats hitting us with emotions. There is some nice addition to the extra-terrestrial creatures like the cute\\, little Porgs and the striking Vulptex but it would have been better if there was even a small dialogue between an alien character and someone. The Star Trek reboot really overshadows Star Wars Sequel Trilogy when it comes to the way the extra-terrestrial creatures are managed and are an worthwhile addition to the plot.\\n\\nAs of actors\\, it is a tie between Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac for the best performance delivered by an actor in the film. Mark Hamill oozes charisma as Luke Skywalker. Adam Driver brings out emotions on the screen smoothly. Benicio Del Toro was a bit underwhelming in his short appearance\\, Carrie Fisher is charming as she has always been (may God rest her soul). John Boyega\\, Domhnall Gleeson\\, Kelly Marie Tran and Laura Dern all give an overall good performance. Not to mention Andy Serkis' as Snoke is powerful.\\n\\nWith its pros and cons\\, The Last Jedi is a fine sci-fi space epic with some important stuff being missed out that might and should get covered in Episode IX. It is certainly better than the prequel trilogy and at par with The Force Awakens. Despite being something so new and different\\, The Last Jedi does not suffer with any consistency issues with The Force Awakens and does not fail to amaze you.\\n\\n8\/10.","true":true}
