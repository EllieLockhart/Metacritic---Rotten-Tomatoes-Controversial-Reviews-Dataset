Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Years of character development flushed down the toilet in one movie. No spoilers here\\, but this movie was like seeing Tarzan without his yell\\, watching Terminator without someone getting put in their place by a futuristic robot\\, or Jurassic Park without an epic dinosaur battle. Basically\\, Batman dies from a batmobile accident\\, Wolverine accidentally cuts his own leg off\\, Spider-Man dies when his web snaps when swinging between buildings\\, and Superman drowns because he can't get the kryptonite off his neck. The hero goes down without an homage to his superior powers. This is supposed to be science fiction where our heros are supposed to inspire us and be extraordinary\\, not science non-fiction where our weaknesses lead to our demise. Episode 9 will need to be spectacular to make up for this fiasco.","true":true}
