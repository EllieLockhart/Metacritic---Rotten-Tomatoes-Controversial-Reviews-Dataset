Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The positive critical reception of this film demonstrates the control Disney has on media channels.  The film\\, and characters in it\\, accomplish nothing and the viewer is subsequently left with no payoff for the 152 minute investment.  This is the definition of wheel spinning\\, where the irrelevant side stories distract from any legitimately interesting components of the franchise which are ultimately dismissed and ignored by the time of completion.","true":true}
