No. I find it hard to believe that some people act like this is the best game ever made and that others act like it's literally the worst game ever made. If you want good graphics and gameplay then i could recommend this game on sale. However if you came for the story then I'm afraid this game doesn't have the charm of the original. I found the characters to be frankly boring and forgettable. The bond between Joel and Ellie which made the game so good is cut short. Let me make it clear that I have no issue playing as Ellie or any other woman in any video game but in this game Ellie is rather stale compared to her in the first game. I could go into more detail but long story short I found myself not caring about the majority of characters in this simply because they didn't appeal to me because I found them to be boring. Lastly the ending is very anticlimactic and it was honestly one of the worst endings I have seen in any game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
