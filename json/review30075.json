Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ryan Johnson tried his best to ruin Star Wars with his let the past die them.  This movie could have been great if it wasn't almost everything he did.  From Luke throwing away his Father's lightsaber to the 2-hour ship chase\\, oh and the Casino scene that leads to nowhere.  Then the worst part killing Luke Skywalker....  I wish Disney would delete this movie from the franchise and remake it.","true":true}
