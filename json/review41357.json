Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is Amazing!! I don't care about the audience score\\, I loved this movie. I'm a hardcore Star Wars fan and it's tough to say this but this movie is up there as arguably one of my favorite movies in the entire franchise. there were some minor things I didn't like but I still thought the movie was awesome!!
