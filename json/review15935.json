Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im 49 years old and I went to see the new Start Wars film with my eldest son who has just turned 17. We had heard that the audience reception was mixed\\, but it wasnt going to stop us. Both of us we really wanting it to be a good file if not great - and neither was disappointed with the latest film. I thought it was a very good attempt to continue the saga albeit there were some unexpected surprises such as the conflict within the male and female leads and the demise of one of the long established characters. All together one of my most enjoyable trips to the movies in 2017.","true":true}
