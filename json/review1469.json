Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a female fan\\, I was shocked by the total lack of female character development\/arcs. The male characters (Luke\\, Kylo\\, Poe\\, Finn) are flawed\\, conflicted and interesting. They grow and change. But the female characters (Leia\\, Rey\\, Rose\\, Admiral Holdo) are flat\\, morally \\\"pure\\,\\\" and have all the answers from start to finish. While their plans are occasionally thwarted (always by men)\\, the women never fail on a personal level\\, so I found them impossible to relate to. As a woman\\, I want realistic female characters who are challenged\\, tempted\\, mistaken\\, devastated - and grow as a result. What message does this send to kids? It's okay for boys to make mistakes and learn from failure - but only perfect girls are worthy of portrayal? Women are only there to redirect men\\, clean up their messes\\, and make up for men's failings? Come on\\, Disney.","true":true}
