There is also major plot holes in the story and The game took elements of what worked for the first game without understanding what made them compelling. It seems like this game was done by other studio. The advertising for the game was miss leading us to believe that was about something it was not and trying to tell us Joel was bigger part of the story than he actually was\\, if they had to keep the story the same they should of have finished the game on the tractor with JJ. In the end worst triple A game of 2020 and worst Naughty Dog Game the should just ended it at the first one...\u2026 Expand","true":true}
