Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Display of immense power on both sides of the force only to be met with an anti-climactic demise. Very disappointing in many ways. Lack of developing characters from TFA to the end of TLJ. There were some good parts to the film and overall it was filmed beautifully as far as visuals go. The end is such a let down for this franchise. It's clear the original trilogy will never be topped.","true":true}
