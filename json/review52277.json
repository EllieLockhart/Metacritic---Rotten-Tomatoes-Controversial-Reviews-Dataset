Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A genuinely shocking entry into the Star Wars universe that pulls at the heart strings of fans and newcomers alike. If you thought some fan theories for TLJ were sort of out of left field\\, then this film isn\u2019t even playing baseball. Some jokes fall a little flat\\, but are mostly enjoyable and Mark Hammil\u2019s performance as Luke Skywalker is perhaps his best yet. ","true":true}
