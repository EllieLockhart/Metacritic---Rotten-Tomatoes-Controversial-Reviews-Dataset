Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"awesome movie\\, i honestly don't understand what's all the hate is about it did what a 2nd movie which is part of a 3 movies franchise could accomplish\\, and it not going the way you wanted it to is not a valid argument.","true":true}
