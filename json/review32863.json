Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars was a huge disappointment.  Some scenes were not necessary such as Luke drinking mils from that animal (and getting it all over his face like a 'got milk' commercial) and walking with that fake looking fish on his back.\\n\\nThey could have deleted Holdo's character entirely.  Still unsure of what that sub plot was about other than ladies know best.\\n\\nI thought the movie was too politically motivated\\, bordering on racist.  White males are either evil (imperial) or have checked out of society\\, unkempt and appearing like a hobo (Luke). There is an obvious  agenda to promote diversity for diversity's sake.  In addition the term Resistance was used over and over\\, and seemed like it was referring to current events (i.e. anti conservative movement) .  I am surprised at Disney\\, and they should have learned by now to wade far from politics.  Not surprising only 50% of people liked the movie.","true":true}
