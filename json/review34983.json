Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film tries too hard to be different. A spanner is thrown in the works every where possible. However\\, it is a 2 star rating from me rather than a 1 star because it's not too much a disaster that can't be fixed in episode 9.","true":true}
