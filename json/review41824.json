Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":" This movie is so good it will help you forget the horrible prequels. See this on the biggest screen you can find. The 3d was excellent\\, and the sound + music will make you part of the action. Worth more than full price ticket. ","true":true}
