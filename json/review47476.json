Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What I liked about The Last Jedi is it was a fresh story\\, but it was familiar at the same time.  There were a few plot holes\\, but overall I found it to be entertaining.   I did enjoy it more than The Force Awakens\\, Phantom Menace\\, and Clone Wars.","true":true}
