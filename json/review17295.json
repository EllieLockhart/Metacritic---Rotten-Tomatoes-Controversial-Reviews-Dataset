Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but It felt really cheesy and shallow. Almost everything that was set up in Force Awakens was brushed aside and failed to deliver any payoff. Much of the run time was wasted on a illogical side story\\, and characters weren't allowed time for proper development. It was a mess. That being said\\, there were a few moments that were enjoyable\\, but they had more to do with spectacle and the actors than story. I hope episode IX is able to improve on these faults and deliver a satisfying conclusion\\, and that Rian Johnson's upcoming trilogy earns its place in the Star Wars canon.","true":true}
