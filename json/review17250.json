{"101487":139263,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really wanted to love this after The Force Awakens. It felt like TFA played it safe to get us all us all back on board\\, and did a great job of that - lots of plots and stories around the characters seeded and ready to bloom. Nothing too original\\, but a safe return ready for the real stuff in 2 and 3. Sorry to say\\, the opposite happened for me with The Last Jedi. It's terminally flawed\\, badly written\\, dreadfully overlooked in the edit and has ruined the entire saga for me. For all the faults of the prequels\\, nothing was done so badly in the story trajectory that it undermined what the whole saga was about. I mean - TLJ is well made visually\\, but that's it. And Rian Johnson is far lazier at relying on CGI than either JJ Abrams or Gareth Edwards (who would have been a far better bet). \\n\\nStar Wars was always the story of the Skywalkers. Even if you count the prequels\\, it was all ultimately about Luke Skywalker rising above usual human failings and risking everything to bring the most feared character in the galaxy back for redemption. Ultimately\\, everything that happens in the real trilogy was now for nothing. They defeat the Empire\\, but they don't really. In fact\\, blowing up the Death Star and killing the Emperor and Darth Vader appears to achieve literally nothing - the Empire carries on as The First Order and the rebels are reduced to a matter of hundreds. Luke becomes a powerful Jedi at last\\, but he doesn't really\\, he becomes a hermit like Ben Kenobi; but without his desire and resolve to still change things as Obi Wan has\\, when he convinces Luke to join him. He has nothing left of the character we spent 6 films building up to. We're meant to imagine he would go to kill Han and Leia's son in his sleep? Come on. He trains Rey for one lesson. That's it. All the time wasted on the now totally superfluous Finn could have been spent with her really fleshing out her character. And Snoke? Set up pretty well in TFA... cut in half by a snivelling kid whose mind he's supposed to be able to read. A couple of minutes screen time. None of the menace\\, or backstory or class of the Emperor or Darth Vader. And what of the Knights Of Ren? Nothing. Maz? There for the sake of it. General Hux? A leg of ham who is like something from a carry on film - defies explanation. How are we meant to believe he came to command The First Order? Poe is a hero for a hero's sake - no depth there. Phasma? The most under developed\\, pointless character in any of the films.  Watto has more point to him. \\n\\nAll of this is without even talking about how dull the film-long pursuit is\\, or the massive plot hole that a ship going into hyperspace (with no calculations made) can cut their best ship in half.  That's the best they could come up with? Surely\\, this would have meant them doing this in every other film against The Death Star\\, Star Destroyers\\, etc etc We're all up for suspension of belief\\, but when it's this lazy it snaps you out of that suspension and kills the whole experience. Don't even get me going on Mary Poppins. \\n\\nI can't understand how the critics reviews are so high. Feels a little like Imperial patronage from Disney. Truly\\, there's nothing redeeming if you're interested in the plot. As a standalone it works fine perhaps - so I'm told. As a Star Wars film that embrace the other episodes\\, they've destroyed everything. My main gripe is this: Why is it about 'passing the baton on to a new generation'? Why is it not about Luke Skywalker\\, about him finally reaching the level of wisdom and power to take them all the way to the very end\\, like a Gandalf figure? It's such a negative message to keep reinforcing that only the young are worth a story. He's only in his 50's or 60's. If his story truly ended in ROTJ\\, then why bring him\\, or Han\\, or Leia\\, or any of them back at all? They should have been myths\\, legends\\, referred to very briefly\\, once\\,  but never seen. The film makers should have had the guts to write a whole new story.  The soul is gone\\, but the franchise is willing. Cameos for cash. \\n\\nIt just feels like a huge\\, huge mistake\\, badly written and something RIan Johnson will come to always regret. He's now the David Moyes of film making. He had the dream job and he couldn't take the pressure. I think he'll do far better with the new triligy (and who cares?) because he can start from scratch. This was a total mess. Awful. Star Wars is dead to me.","true":true}
