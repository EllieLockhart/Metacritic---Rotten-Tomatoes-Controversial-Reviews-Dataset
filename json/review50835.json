Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bloated mess of a film that is too long and has character's behaving like morons simply for the sake of plot convenience. A post-modern insincere deconstruction of traditional star wars themes & characters. Easily the worst installment of the franchise.","true":true}
