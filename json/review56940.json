Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The tone of the entire movie can be summed up by Luke flippantly tossing his lightsaber over his shoulder. Nothing has any meaning anymore. What used to be a story of moral conflict\\, good vs evil\\, destiny\\, and redemption has been reduced to a bleak\\, nihilistic\\, blob of animal rights\\, social justice\\, and lazy story telling. The film wasted so many good opportunities set up by Abrams to instead meander around the galaxy fighting battles for animal rights and class warfare. In this movie\\, good and evil are subjective\\, men are stupid hot heads\\, gravity exists in space\\, and plot armor abounds. If you want to turn off your brain and watch good special effects and cute animals  then this is your movie. Mark Hamill probably needs counselling after being subjected to this humiliating experience. If you want to watch a meaningful story about a hero's journey\\, just stay home and drink the green milk of a farting elephant person.","true":true}
