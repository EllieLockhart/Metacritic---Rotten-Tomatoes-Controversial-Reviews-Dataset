{"101487":119021,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything new in Episode 7 that kept us asking questions over the last year meets an unceremonious end in order to clear the way for a much simpler story about two brats with laser swords who will probably kill one another in episode 9. Poe is a dickhead whose entire ark in this movie is that he gets his comrades killed and attempts to take over his commanding officer's ship because she doesn't fully explain her plan and he recieves consistent praise for it. Said commanding offiicer sacrifices her ship by crashing it into an enemy ship... and miracuously manages to then cut through like 5 star destroyers at varying distance and altitudes... leading me to wonder why they don't make weapons like that since said manuever penetrated the ship's shields (an earlier plot point bring that up). Fin gets toted around by a new character whose only personality trait was looking awkward. I still don't know anything about Rey\\, except this movie taught me not to care. Snoke dies the moment he seems interesting. Luke dies basically because the movie needed to end and it comes from no where. Every moment that the music tells me to care about is flat or unearned. The big lightsaber fight scene felt mostly shot in a landscape or at angles where the action didn't feel as personal as it was in previous movies. The humor inserted into the movie is inorganic. Characters like DJ bring with them themes that could have been interestig to explore\\, but abruptly end before they start. Fin and girl are about to be executed and because the ship is hit\\, miracuously\\, the storm troopers are seperated m\\, crushed\\, or set on fire allowing them to escape\\, even though they were surrounded. BB8 pulls the writers out of the corner one too many times. The final ship battle proves the First Order has the worst ain of ANY enemy army EVER put to film. There are barely any aliens\\, and the ones they introduced are either forgettable or felt too human. Subjects that appeared to hold weight lose if\\, like the scene where Rey talks to the mirror at the bottom of a dark pit\\, or rather\\, talks to the audience which was... out of place. Also\\, there's a sequence where the resistance drop bombs on an enemy ship..... in space... which leads me to ask\\, how the hell the bombs fell if they weren't jet propelled. The Yoda puppet looked like garbage\\, and the new squirell penguins looked still when practical. The Chrome Trooper is laser proof... which leads me to ask why the rest of their tech isn't coated in that material... and she loses to Fin after he fell what appeared to be 2 feet into a pit only for him to rise back out of it in like 5 seconds. The casino planet is a 5 year old's impression of Las Vegas. Honestly... side from Luke telling Kylo \\\"No\\\" this movie was a garbage fire. I laughed whwn i shouldn't have\\, I cringed when I ws supposed to care\\, and I laughed for hours afterward trying to get over what I just paid for. This movie is a waste if everyone's investment in episode 7. We put our chips in and lost. Disney is a master troll. Do not see this one.","true":true}
