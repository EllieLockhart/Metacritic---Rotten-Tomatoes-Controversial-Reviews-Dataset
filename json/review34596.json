Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bottom line is I did not like the movie at all.  Yes\\, I saw the original trilogy as a kid and yes I had high expectations for the movie to be good.  First\\, I felt the plot was not that great.  All that build up for Luke to get his light saber back and then he threw it told me this was not going to be good.  The bad jokes\\, the slow space chase of the Resistance from the First Order\\, the uselessness of all the new characters\\,  the Disney toy plug with the meaninglessness of the Casino planet adventure\\, Leia blasted into space\\, making Finn and Poe look stupid versus every female character\\, cowardly Luke\\, leaving Snoke an empty character and poor man's Hoth battle with just a handful of the Resistance left made for a long disappointing story.  I don't know if JJ Abrams can fix thus with Episode 9 but I have no interest in Rian Johnson's trilogy because I think he did a poor job of trying to open up the Star Wars saga to a new audience by insulting the loyal fans that go back to the 1970's with a poorly written and directed movie that went against George Lucas vision.  I have no ill will.  I just don't have any interest in Rian Johnson's vision.","true":true}
