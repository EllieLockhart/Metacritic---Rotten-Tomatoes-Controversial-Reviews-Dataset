Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw this movie in IMAX and in 3D. That's how much I looked forward to this film\\, and IMAX and 3D couldn't help it. Probably the worst Star Wars movie made. Period. People\/Critics who are saying this movie was good are either saying it because a) it's Star Wars or b) they were paid or are afraid to fall from the grace of Disney by giving a bad review.  EVERYONE I've talked to who actually saw it\\, no matter the age or location\\, were completely turned off\\, frustrated\\, and just let down. I will spoil this movie because I'm doing you a favor.\\n\\nThe good was the first 20 minutes\\, visuals\\, music\\, the reintroduction of beloved characters and some of the acting by Adam Driver\\, but that's about it\\, hence the one star.  \\n\\n*Rant*\\nThe writing was terrible.  The timelines didn't make sense. Most of the acting and dialogue is forced\\, hollow\\, and propaganda-ish. You can tell that Disney was trying to introduce a formula like they have in the Marvel series and it just does not work. There is actually dialogue that is structured to explain the movie. Rey can\\, apparently\\, master the Force to elite Jedi-like levels in less than 18 hours and 3 lessons. She was mechanical and pretty dull. Oh\\, and she just hands herself over to Kylo for pretty much no reason. The Force can now do things where there is no evidence that it can do those things in any of the Star Wars lore.  The animals are basically Pokemon. Leia can now use the Force....and fly in space after taking a direct hit from a blast and being out there for\\, like 15 minutes. Chewy is officially the dog of Star Wars. Any male character can do no right or is in a position of evil. Regardless his immense power\\, Snoke\\, evidently\\, isn't all that important of a character and can be killed off. Rose makes Jar Jar Binks look tolerable. Finn is a non-factor. The attempted melding of Han and Lando into whatever Benicio del Toro's character is had no legs. General Akbar deserved better than what happened to him. The laughs are cheap and cartoonish. And there is just so. much. more.\\n\\nNo questions were really answered\\, and any new questions that were developed I don't care for what the answers may be. Rian Johnson deserves a good ass kicking as all equity gained from TFA and Rogue One has been spent by this utter disappointment.","true":true}
