Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely adored this movie. It had its flaws but there weren't enough to weigh it down. I absolutely loved the new take that Rian Johnson took with the franchise\\, and made it more human. All the hate on this movie is mostly coming from \\\"fans\\\" that will never be pleased with anything done that isn't the Original Trilogy. They complain that they ruined everything in this one by changing too much\\, hates the force awakens for being too similar. This movie shows more than TFA did that it's time to move forward and stop harping on the greatness of the past and make something new\\, which seeps into the movie's plot as well. Leaving spoilers behind\\, the cinematography was absolutely stunning and the development they gave certain characters make this movie my second favorite in the trilogy after the first viewing. To all the \\\"fans\\\" bogging down the rating: Accept that this is something new\\, and hopefully you can see that this movie was a brilliant step in a new direction for the franchise.","true":true}
