Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was AMAZING. A great tribute to the original movies. Lots of references to them. Its not the best Star Wars movie\\, Empire Strikes Back takes that\\, but I will rank it in my top 3. The only problem with the movies was the flow\\, and the Finn and Rose arch. I have so much respect for Finn then Rose happens.\\n\\n\\nIll give it a 8.5 or 9 \/ 10!!!","true":true}
