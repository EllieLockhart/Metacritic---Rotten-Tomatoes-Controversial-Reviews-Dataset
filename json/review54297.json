{"101487":133329,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had great hopes for The Last Jedi\\, but\\, where to begin... as Mark Hamill has said\\, \\\"it's LONG.\\\" Too long. And little has been accomplished in the more than two hours of feature. The Force Awakens left many fans with exciting questions about what The Last Jedi would bring\\, and every hope and dream and anticipation fell flat (you'll hear this a lot from just about everyone). The film tried so hard to be unpredictable that it ended up about as unsatisfying as finding out there's no milk left after you've poured the cereal. There is very little character development and many pointless digressions. Newly introduced characters are forgettable and any excitement or suspense built up throughout the plot is swiftly extinguished by the most unimaginable twists and turns so unrealistic they can't even comfortably belong in a space-fantasy feature\\, of all things. If you enjoy unanswered questions\\, awkward story-lines and awkward character development\\, you'll LOVE Star Wars episode 8! :D","true":true}
