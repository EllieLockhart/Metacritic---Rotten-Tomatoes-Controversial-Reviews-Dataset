Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is visually stunning.  It is paired with a gorgeous score and witty dialouge.  The shots were well thought out and the film creatively executed tough concepts such as the force bond between Kylo Ren and Rey and Luke's Force projection.  The use of both visual motifs and sound brought the film to the next level.","true":true}
