Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst SW ever. Too long\\, too boring\\, way too many cute animals that will become merchandise (even for a SW movie)\\, nothing really happens for two hours\\, giant plot holes\\, lasers going down because of gravity\\, fuel restrictions\\, Leila comes back from space\\, admiral Ackbar dies and no one cares... but hey\\, the light-speed jump that destroys the dreadnought is awesome! Btw\\, why they did't destroy all death stars in that way? Why is it necessary to build a death star when you can light speed a cargo into a planet?","true":true}
