Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought Star Wars the last Jedi was really good and it does show some stuff they close the gap from the force awakens and I thought it was an excellent movie to the trilogy of Star Wars and it is worth seeing the second time","true":true}
