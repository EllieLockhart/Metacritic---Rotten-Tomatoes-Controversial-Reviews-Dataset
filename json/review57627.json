Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many cheap jokes\\, became a bit of a slap stick comedy.\\n\\nConvient  plot devices that did not make sense or were just shoe horned in with no explanation.\\n\\nI got very bored in the cinema watching this and close to walking out. Very little in the way of moving aspects of the story arc a long either.","true":true}
