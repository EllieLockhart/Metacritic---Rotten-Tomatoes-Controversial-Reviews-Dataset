Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are to many things that have been covered to give it a higher rating. The treatment of Luke and the complete mess that was Rey's parents reveal.....just not very happy with this film.....wasted so many characters for nothing.","true":true}
