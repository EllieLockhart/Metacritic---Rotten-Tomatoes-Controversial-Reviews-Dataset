Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was totally excited to see this with my dad because we have seen all of them at the theater since the phantom menace. We were so depressed walking out tonight. We both didn't understand the story\\, it didn't seem like a Star Wars movie. Dumb jokes\\, if the characters aren't going to take it seriously why should I? Luke wasn't a hero anymore? Why? I don't get it.","true":true}
