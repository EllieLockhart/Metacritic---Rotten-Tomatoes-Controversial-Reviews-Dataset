The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have now finally finished the game after 33 hours\\, and I feel ready to give my review. With every game I play\\, I always look for certain key points: Story\\, Dialogue\\, Characters\\, Details\\, Gameplay\\, Graphics\\, Music\/Audio\\, Meaning\/Emotion and Afterthought. For me\\, The Last of Us Part 2 is revolutionary is every single key point\\, and I don't need to write a novel about how beautiful the game is\\, how awesome the gameplay is or how extreamly detailed it is. No one thinks otherwise\\, no matter how much someone dislikes the story. The main theme of the story is \\\"the different sides to a conflict\\\". And it's kind of poetic\\, that this is exactly what is happening to the games fan base right now. To understand the message Naughty and Co. Is trying to give\\, there is a point to consider from the first game: The final scene with Ellie and Joel\\, we hear Ellie talk about her time after her and Riley getting bit. Ellie talks about her waiting to die\\, and we get a feeling the reason she's been this happy and positive kid throughout the entire game\\, was because she felt her time was overdue.And by giving her immunity to the Fireflies\\, her (and Rileys) death would mean something. Her life would have meant something. And Joel took this away from her. So when the thing with Joel happened in Part 2\\, her old feelings of needing her life to matter\\, returned. Including the feeling of impending doom\/knowing you will die soon. She already had a sort of PTSD long before Part 2. When she finally reach Abby\\, and actually are mere seconds away from getting what she wants\\, and what she thinks will put the visions of Joel's bloody and lifeless body to rest\\,  she still sees Joel. The PTSD visions doesn't go away by doing this. And when Abby is dead\\, then what? Will the act of killing her be the one thing that makes Ellie's life have meaning? Does she have to replace Abby with someone new\\, for Ellie's life to have meaning?The final scene is Ellie leaving Joel's Guitar\\, and leaving the farm. She has finally let him go. Let him rest\\, and now will try to find a new meaning with her life. Maybe Dina? Little Potato? Back to Jackson? We may never know\\, but that's the beauty of it all. Another thing worth mentioning: Neither Abby or Ellie know why any of them is after each other. Ellie doesn't know Joel killed Abby's dad\\, and Abby doesn't know Ellie was the immune girl. What would have happened if they had just talked about it? Sometimes the refusal to listen to each other's motivation in a conflict\\, can destroy entire communities and families\\, and if we just listen to each other\\, we may actually find peace for once.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
