Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to create an account to write an review to give my 2 cent opinion.\\n\\nWanted to give less then 1\/2 star but that is not counted in the rotten tomatoes averages. \\nThis movie is the worst star wars film ever made\\, riddled with plot holes\\, badly written movie\\, SJW agenda sprinkled in the movie. \\nI can type a complete story of what is wrong with the movie but that has been done already by other people. \\n\\nFrom a customer perspective a complete rip off and Episode 8 already killed Episode 9 to be interesting to watch.","true":true}
