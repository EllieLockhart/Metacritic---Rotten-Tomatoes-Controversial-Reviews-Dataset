Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visual stunning. Amazing character development. Mark & Carrie were perfect. The new era of Star Wars had it's foundation built with The Force Awakens\\, and is now moving ahead with The Last Jedi in a brilliant new direction. Rian did a fantastic job.","true":true}
