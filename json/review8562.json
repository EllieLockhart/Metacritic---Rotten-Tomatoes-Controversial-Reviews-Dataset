Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Firstly\\, people giving this movie a 1\/2 or 1 star are fully retarded as this movie from a review standpoint is evidently better than that.  The plot does work and follows previous star wars traits and it is an exciting movie.  There is no way this movie is of 1\/2 or 1 star rating and anyone trying to sabotage the rating of this movie with ridiculously low ratings without real reasoning\\, such as an un-followable script\\, or laughably bad acting (neither of which is here) shouldn't be allowed to give ratings.","true":true}
