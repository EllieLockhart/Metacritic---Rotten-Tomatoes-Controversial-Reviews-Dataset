Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far a joke to the Star Wars franchise! First off the story had all over it\\, and actions that were taking place for no apparent reason. They completely ruined every other Star Wars space combat by having a rebel ship going into lightspeed to take out a dozen or two of the Empire's most deadly ships. why haven't the rebels done this in the past? Just take a bunch of ships in space that have a pilot and RAM them into every single Empire ship boom War over. Don't even get me started on Luke Skywalker. Strongest guy we know of still alive for the Jedi. And here comes this girl who has no training and somehow kicks his butt? Like what the heck? all she's doing is swinging to stick around it's not like she's getting any training. This movie is completely ruining every Star Wars before it!","true":true}
