Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was born in 1976\\, have been a devoted fan my entire life\\, and loved this installation in the saga. The fan backlash is mystifying to me. There are too many things to get in to in such a short space\\, but the present and future owes nothing to the fans other than to make a great\\, fun\\, interesting movie that moves the ball forward. This movie does all that and more. It has some of the best use of effects I've ever witnessed\\, the story makes complete sense to me\\, and I was totally engrossed from start-to-finish. I plan to watch this many\\, many times and can't wait to see where the trilogy ends up.","true":true}
