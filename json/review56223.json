Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars something: The Black and Red One. \\nI am a proud nerd and a Star Wars fan and a movie buff and I've already forgotten which number this is. \\n\\nTurns out unfortunately that this entry is not a very rewatchable one. I remember almost every scene and got no more enjoyment watching it again. Rian Johnson has crafted a movie of scenes and his spirit and very little else. This time\\, that's not enough for me\\, it's not enough for this franchise. \\n\\nThe twist of Rey's parentage is equisite and equisitely acted and very beautifully simple. I'm praying they don't retcon it in Episode: The Next One. \\n\\nFull of pointless scenes and contrivances this is filler that leaves all characters for the worst. Still it looks great and the battles are nice and it doesn't reek of reshoots like every other blockbusters these days. Shame this wasn't Johnson's spin off instead.\\n\\nIt's a collection of fantastic ideas and rippling potential\\, eclipsed by muddy execution\\, lack of meaningful plot and character progression and multiple scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor. An accomplished movie but illicits neither deep introspection or fist pumping elation as the credits draw over the experience. Rian Johnson may be a better director than writer\\, choraling together something entertaining but not inspiring and ultimately pointless.","true":true}
