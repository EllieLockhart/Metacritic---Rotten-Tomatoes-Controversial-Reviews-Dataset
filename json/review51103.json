Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely Fantastic Story and plot! Tons of action and Drama! A must see movie in theaters and IMax and Dolby Cinemas. Can't wait to see it again and again! Mark Hamill is Awesome and the best Jedi of All time!!! You will see some of the most unique space ships ever in this movie.","true":true}
