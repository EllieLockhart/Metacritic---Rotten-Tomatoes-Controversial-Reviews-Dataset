Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account just to leave a review. Such a disappointing movie. It seemed good for a while\\, but the aggressive feminist\\, animal rights\\, and anti white male themes left a bad taste in my mouth. This movie has me considering going Disney-free until they clean up their act big time. Also\\, pretty weird how the tomatometer is so high (of 370 reviewers) when most of the audience out of 187\\,000  is saying the movie is garbage... Paid reviewers maybe?","true":true}
