Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sick of the \\\"left\\\" pushing their agenda on my Facebook\\, I certainly don't want it in my \\\"escape time\\\" I pay for. Every moment was a leftist training video\\, right down to burning the old Jedi text to get rid of the \\\"old ways\\\". Can we say mirroring removing the constitution? I could go on forever but there's lots of YouTube videos that can explain better than me. Thanks Disney for making that push so I can fully be a Star Trek fan rather than a Star Wars fan.","true":true}
