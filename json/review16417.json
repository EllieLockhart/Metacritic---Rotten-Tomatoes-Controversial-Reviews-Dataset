Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im so disappointed in this movie i signed up on rotten tomatoes just to say how disappointed I am in this movie. I could have forgiven everything they did wrong. if they let Luke Skywalker go out like a badass with one last hurrah. The social justice warrior and feminist political agendas. Leias marry poppins stunt. Rey being a unbeatable Mary Sue with no training. There now being no believably dangerous villain. I coulda forgiven all of that.  Instead Luke just dissapears and floats away like a fart in the wind. After they tease a super badass starwars confrontation just to take it back for cheap shock value.  It was a delight to see Mark Hamillon the big screen again though. And so you guys know I'm not some super hardcore fan. I don't read the books\\, comics or play the games. I just like the movies. Well not this one.","true":true}
