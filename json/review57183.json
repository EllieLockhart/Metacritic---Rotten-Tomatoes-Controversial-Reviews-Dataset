Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the second worst in the Star Wars series.  The acting is average to mediocre as are the characters themselves.  The funny jokes are unnatural and contrived especially compared to the original Star Wars which had humorous and memorable lines which were essential parts to the spectacle as opposed to the fake and forgettable attempts at meaningless humor.  The movie drags in parts especially Rey's discovery and tutelage with Luke Skywalker.  The Yoda scene is the worst in Star Wars history and was somewhat unintelligible and not meaningful.  The sound especially in the RPX theater I was in was\\, however\\, fabulous and earthshaking which is one of the few complimentary things I can say about this movie.  The plot and storyline was also like a television movie.  I am a big Star Wars fan and believe most fans like me who were mesmerized in 1976\/77 by the original will be sorely disappointed.","true":true}
