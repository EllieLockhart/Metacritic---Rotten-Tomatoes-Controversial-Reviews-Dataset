Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"snoke is a nobody...reys parents were nobodiea...princess L. can fly...Ms. Dern...Poe is an idiot....why are Finn and rose in this movie...kylo is just a terrible character that isn't even scary...luke just vanishes?!! the casino scene...wow...the cartoons had better plots....oh..I guess we just shoot x wings at light speed at everything now...","true":true}
