{"101487":117734,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the WORST Star Wars film to date. I have zero interest in the 'story' being told in this new trilogy now. It  just seems like all the most interesting stuff keeps happening off screen\\, mostly before the events of Force Awakens. People expecting answers as to the big questions presented by Force Awakens will be sorely disappointed\\, there were NONE given. Characters were wasted and had ZERO arcs before being disposed of\\, classic characters were similarly misused\\, and most of the film revolves around the more boring and tedious game of cat and mouse I have ever witnessed and relies on the villains showing James Bond Villain levels of stupidity. This sets up nothing interesting for the third and final film in this new trilogy. I am anticipating another HUGE time jump between Last Jedi and the next film\\, this is the only way they are going to be able to wrap up this story arc in any kind of realistic way\\, meaning that YET AGAIN we can expect the most interesting stuff to happen OFF SCREEN in the sequel\\, with little exposition to catch us back up with whats happened during the film itself. Everything just feels sooo rushed in Last Jedi\\, characters talk about other characters like they've had this rich lore filled background\\, but the audience isn't given a chance to see any of this on the big screen and is obviously expected to do further reading from the novels\/other materials\\, to have any idea of whats going on. Two big questions going into the film I had were\\, WHO was Snoke? and Who were Reys Parrents and how was she able to use the force so well (having seemingly never been trained in it's ways etc) in the Force Awakens? Neither of these questions were ever answered during the course of this film. Hell\\, I'd heard fan theories that were more compelling\\, than the actual non answers we got. As for Snoke\\, he is utterly pointless. He's built up as this HUGE threat\\, but no background other than 'he's a HUGE threat' is ever given about him and in the end it all amounts to a big fat NOTHING! Where the hell is the story telling? This just feels like a rushed project to meet a deadline\\, rather than someone who actually had a worthwhile story to tell. Lastly\\, the film tries to bait and switch a lot with certain things\\, attempting to do a 'shocking reveal' towards the end\\, but honestly it's not remotely shocking\\, its actually pretty obvious what was going to happen. I REALLY wish they'd have the balls to do something genuinely shocking and do an interesting twist on Reys Story Arc\\, but alas they did not\\, so we got the most predictable 'arc' for both Rey and Kylo instead! :(","true":true}
