Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can think of The Last Jedi like two movies (it's almost long enough). One movie is good\\, it updates stale elements\\, excites\\, and thrills. The other seems pointless\\, juvenile. But more importantly\\, it is an insult to the previous film\\, and the fervent fan speculation it endeared. Remember the mysteries surrounding Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, and Luke's lightsaber? Turns out all three were pointless. With stale jokes\\, plot holes\\, and pointless escapades\\, not even the fresh moral ambiguities and stunning set pieces make The Last Jedi a success.","true":true}
