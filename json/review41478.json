Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is atrocious on multiple levels. However\\, it looks and sounds wonderful\\, so see it if you're into that. Except for the porgs. Screw those things\\, they looked awful. \\nThe plot is terrible\\, the acting is weak\\, the runtime is mind-numbingly long. I do not recommend\\, whether you're a Star Wars fan or not.","true":true}
