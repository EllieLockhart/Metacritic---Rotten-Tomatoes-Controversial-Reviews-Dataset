Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yeah I defenitely want a star wars movie that shits all over Luke and whole star wars. Tlj is the worst sw movie ever. Nothing happens in this movie\\, nothing is accomplished\\, the story doesn't go forward\\, no character development and\\, worst of all and unforgivable\\, the destruction of luke skywalker.","true":true}
