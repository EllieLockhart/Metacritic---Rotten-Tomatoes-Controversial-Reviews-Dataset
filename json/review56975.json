Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen\\, and this is including TPM. Terrible convoluted plot (Sandra Bullock\/Keanu Reeves Speed bad). Honest one of the dumbest plots devices I\u2019ve ever seen in a movie. The dialogue was the worst in any Star Wars movie. Failed attempt after failed attempt at one liners that fell flat and ruined otherwise dramatic scenes. Parts of the plot were completely pointless. At least 30 minutes of the movie were wasted on a plot line that didn\u2019t matter. We get it you like Porgs... they were in WAY too many scenes. Rey\u2019s parent reveal and what happens with Snoke were absolutely stupid\\, and cr&@$ all over the questions fans had after force awakens. Luke was completely wasted the entire movie. I really hope Disney reconsiders using Johnson in the future\\, I have no desire to watch any of them\\, or even episode 9 now...","true":true}
