{"101487":174086,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The fan reaction to this movie reminds me a lot of The Phantom Menace\\, people and critics alike come out of the film with glowing reviews not realizing the glaring flaws of the film. Now there's no Jar Jar\\, thank goodness\\, but I think a lot of people are drunk on excitement that they are coming out loving the movie no matter what\\, just like The Phantom Menace.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi ruined the Force Awakens. All the mystery and build up of FA was reduced to being unimportant.  Snoke was pointless\\, Rey's background wasn't important\\, where the heck are the Knights of Wren. Luke was a huge disappointment and didn't act at all like himself. Poe was made to look like a male bafoon in place to make a female leader look good\\, and him keeping Finn and Roses' mission a secret was ridiculous. Holdo  was a character to just die and create pointless tension and to die in place of Leia without us actually having any emotional significance.  Phasma was pointless. Luke's death was pointless\\, why would he project himself to fool Kylo if he's going to die anyways. Why tease Luke's X-Wing if he's not going to use it\\, him actually fighting Kylo and actually dying in the fight would have been a lot more significant. And what the heck is Kylo Ren's motivation? Snoke seemed to have some kind of plan\\, but you know\\, he's dead.","true":true}
