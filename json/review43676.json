Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was single handedly the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Visually\\, it was intertaining\\, but the story was terrible. There were so many unanswered questions\\, the casino scene was a waste of time\\, and the decision to kill Luke off in the manner they did was a terrible mistake. If Luke had to die\\, it should have been after an epic battle against Snoke or something to that nature. This film is geared toward those millennials and in doing so destroyed Star Wars. I won't be seeing episode IX until I can redbox it. Disney absolutely butchered Star Wars...","true":true}
