Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst sequel to a MAJOR good movie (The Force Awakens) since The Exorcist 2 and Batman Returns. Horrible screenplay. Johnson had no business writing a Star Wars script all by himself. Empire\\, Return of the Jedi\\, Force Awakens\\, and the Indiana Jones movies were ALL written by multiple writers. Empire was even co written by The Big Sleep screenwriter Leigh Brackett (a woman). And I'm a proud graduate of the USC Film School so I know what I'm talking about. Was in denial of just how bad it is until recently. If they were alive today Siskel and Ebert would've given it two thumbs way down. Worst line in the whole movie is Luke of all people saying the history of the Jedi is failure. That's an atrocity of a line that young kids are sadly subjected to even being uttered. Only highlight is Adam Driver's performance\/his character arc of eliminating his pull to the light and John William's score. Let's hope and pray J.J. can clean up the mess...Critics who rave about this turkey know better and are either sucking up to get more free passes to Disney events or are in the tank simply because they are liberals and support the left leaning tendencies of the movie. They're not real critics. The fans are doing the job the critics in this country used to do.","true":true}
