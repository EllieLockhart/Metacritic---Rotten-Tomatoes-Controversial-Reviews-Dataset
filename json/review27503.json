Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I did like the movie.  Kelly Marie Tran was great as Rose as well as Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron.  John Boyega was okay as Finn.  However\\, this movie\\, did not have some elements I was expecting it to have.  I expected Kylo Ren to turn to the good side and Rey to turn to the Sith.  But Rey remained a Rebel and Kylo Ren was a Sith.  Also\\, Rey never uses the Force to fight off a powerful Sith\\, like Supreme Leader Snoke (who was killed by Ren). But some of the action scenes were good and Carrie Fisher was able to do well before her death.","true":true}
