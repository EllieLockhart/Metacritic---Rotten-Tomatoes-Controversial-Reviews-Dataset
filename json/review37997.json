Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The special effects were ok. Lets face it\\, most fans know how wrong this movie is. Its Girl Power on Lance Armstrong level steroids. There is no hero's journey as Rey can just do everything without any effort or training. The men can't do anything right. Luke is not the Luke of the original trilogy. I could go on and on\\, but I need to feed the kids.","true":true}
