Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just can't understand the hate this movie is getting here. When TFA came out\\, people complained about it being too similar to the first Star Wars movie. Haters called it a \\\"carbon coby\\\" and \\\"unoriginal\\\". And now\\, TLJ takes the franchise it brand new directions and they complain even more? It just doesn't make any sense!\\n\\nI personally think this is the best Star Wars movie I've seen in a while. It's the closest we've ever got to the original trilogy. It's bold\\, risky\\, brave\\, action-packed\\, funny\\, emotional and visually stunning! It's everything a blockbuster should be\\, yet people still feel the need to bring it down. It's such a shame.","true":true}
