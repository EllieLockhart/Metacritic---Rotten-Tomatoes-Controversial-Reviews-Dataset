For those disliking the story\\, you might want to consider a lesson in History and the brutally of the real world and perhaps even the foundations of Psychology to comprehend empathy and sympathy. The games story takes some degree of intelligence to appreciate and understanding the meaning of what these fictional characters are experiencing and how the story unfolds for them.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
