Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has become my favorite in the franchise by a large margin. It adresses some of the flaws I found in the original trilogy such as\\, the over-emphasis of dynasties that made the universe feel small\\, and the black and white portrayal of good and evil. It delves into the idea of the \\\"grey Jedi\\\" which yields one of the most complex and interesting dynamics between a protagonist and antagonist that we've seen in the series.\\n\\nThe themes of failure and regret lead Luke Skywalker on a classic\\, but little used character arch of the fallen hero. Culminating in one of the best interactions between Luke and Yoda of the series and a send-off for the hero that could not be more fitting to his character.\\n\\nPoe's arc involves learning the difference between heroism and leadership and when each is most appropriate and the director does such a good job of helping us empathize with Poe's perspective\\, that many thought it was a flaw of the film that Poe should have to grow into better version of himself.\\n\\nFinn's character arc involves learning to believe in something bigger than himself while also discovering just what people mean when they talk about a spark of hope that will \\\"burn the First Order down\\\" by experiencing first hand the oppressed children in Canto Bight and the rich few who profit from their oppression.\\n\\nDespite the wealth of deeper meaning just below the surface of pretty much every scene in the film\\, it still manages to keep a brisk pace while juggling multiple poignant themes and deliver fun action and comedy\\, dazzling visuals\\, and the fantastic score that you expect from Star Wars.\\n\\nIf you've lost your sense of childhood wonder since you first experienced the original trilogy and cant bring yourself to leave your snarky cynicism at the door before seeing a fantasy film\\, then this and any other fantasy movie is no longer for you. Sorry.\\n\\nIf you can still enjoy Star Wars for the light-hearted\\, Flash-Gordon-inspired\\, wizards-in-space\\, romp that is and has always been the heart of Star Wars\\, you're in for a treat!","true":true}
