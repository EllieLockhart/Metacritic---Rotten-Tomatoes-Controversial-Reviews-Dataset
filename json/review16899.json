Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In today's day & age it seems that if we like the old stuff\\, we can't like the new stuff. This is a ridiculous notion. I am both a fan of what George Lucas created & what disney has done. This movie is by no means perfect but it is a well welcome addition to the greatest film franchise of all time. It's fine if you do not like it but don't shove down peoples throats that they should hate it or like it too. Enjoy the movie. I personally Loved it and welcome it as a awesome addition.","true":true}
