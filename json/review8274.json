Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far superior than The Force Awakens.  Was it a perfect movie ? No\\, but it was still very much enjoyable and pushed the plot a lot better than the last.  I find a lot of the people I talk to who whine about the movie are mad because their terrible fan theories did not pan out or complain about a particular even ruining a character ..... If these people were fans of Star wars AT ALL... They would know before Disney changed cannon it went MUCH farther in that direction and it made for great story.. idk what can I say about it ? Do yourself a favor and go watch for yourself \\, don't believe the hate train","true":true}
