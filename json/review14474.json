Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated it so much. All my life I've been an avid Star Wars fan and I hated this movie so much I not only don't want to see any more Star Wars movies\\, but I don't want to keep the others I own copies of. I don't even want to see any more marvel movies just because they're owned by the same company that allowed this abomination to be shown.","true":true}
