Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a ratty\\, tatty patchwork mess the pace was the equivalent of sitting in a car being driven by a learner behind the wheel of a stick shift manual\\, lurching forward & stalling then restarting the car\\, lurching over & over:  the side stories were agonizing to sit through like a trip to the dentist\\, i oddly found myself sitting in the cinema wishing i had a remote control to fast forward them: there was so much hype that my expectations were raised high but were flattened at the reality of the experience: i found the new characters boring\\, like shallow projections i found no reason to relate to. The kylo ren snoke kill scene was abrupt & poorly executed & felt as unsatisfying to watch as a fighter jet pilot bombing afghani civillians on the ground through a grey night vision screen: we were all being fed so many false tidbits leading up to tlj release which were unfortunately better than the actual movie. Im sure disney throws out a bunch of disinfo before the release to throw people off but it just left me expecting so much more than was delivered. I left the cinema asking what just happened? & being unable to find any closure because nothing really happened. It was a perplexing mess. Dont waste your money on this one wait for it to come out on dvd. Its a sad disappointment.","true":true}
