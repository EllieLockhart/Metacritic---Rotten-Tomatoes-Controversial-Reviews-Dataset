Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waste of time. Plotting and boring\\, this film is the epitome of using a franchise name to push bland\\, uninventive\\, derivitive\\, and weak storytelling. Characters are unrelatable and surface level\\, dialogue is forced\\, sigh inducing\\, and eye rollingly prolonged\\, and the action\/fx are absolutely not worth the struggle. Music is tame and uninspired. Pretty sad attempt at a money grab\\, the only emotion i had walking out of the theater is shame I payed for it.","true":true}
