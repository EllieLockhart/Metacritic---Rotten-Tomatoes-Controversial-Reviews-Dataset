Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a really good VISUAL spectacle\\, but that is pretty much where the positives end. In terms of story\\, there were so many barely half written story arcs for alot of characters\\, even Rey who is meant to be one of\\, if not the main character felt very VERY 2-dimensional. Without adding spoilers\\, Snoke\\, Phasma\\, the hacker (name feels irrelevant)\\, the purple haired woman (again felt irrelevant)\\, Finn's friend that he does that really long irrelevant sequence with\\, I think her name was Rose\\, were all poorly written (the actors did the best with what they had). The only saving grace for this as a FILM (not even as a film in sequence) just as a standalone film\\, is probably the ending (again I don't want to add spoilers) but Kylo Ren I would say is the only character that has possibly improved since TFA. Rey again just feels like a Mary Sue\/Gary Sue\\, and if that sounds sexist\\, then I'll say she seems like a superman\/woman. To be honest I was looking forward to a female lead in a science fantasy film set within and around space\\, but this is just ridiculous (no hate on Daisy Ridley in any form). \\n\\n*******SPOILERS*******\/RANT BEWARE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-Watching the majority of Star Wars the Last Jedi is akin to watching paint dry with the slowest vehicle chase ever.\\n\\n-Mary Poppins Leia was ridiculous\\, it looked like a pop-up book where you move them with a tab\\, should've just let her die in that scene as it was very touching to see her go in such a way.\\n\\n-The dying of a force stroke\\, really?\\n\\n- rose was a terrible character that the writers have no idea what to do with\\, her sister was more interesting in the 2mins or whatever screen time she got compared to Rose\\n\\n-Snoke was wasted if he is dead\\, if not and it was a trick then kudos (but going on what the writers and director has done so far\\, they will mess that up too)\\n\\n-pretty much everything in the film felt pointless (especially with that random dark side rear end looking thing\\, which made a cool looking scene\\, but was pointless still) and then that purple haired character that no one cares about sacrificing herself with the hyperdrive\\, and captain Phasmas pointless as well (let's try and create a cool and warranted female boba fett like character\\, by doing all of the dumb stuff boba fett did\\, instead of actually making them into a character that people would actually like\\, boba fett was a no f**cks given relentless tactical genius with a rebellious\/terminator kinda feel\\, to the point where Vader even noticed\\, not some failed Hitler's lapdog that again\\, feels pointless)\\, but that's alright because it looked cool ...
