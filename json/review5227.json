Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent movie in its own right\\, though there are a ton of plot holes. Terrible Star Wars movie and infested with political commentary\\, insane levels of feminism to the point that it breaks the story\\, and it ignores a lot of plot points established in TFA.","true":true}
