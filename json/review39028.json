{"101487":180551,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They went shtick comedy. Decided to turn Star Wars into  guardians of the galaxy. Kids liked it. I love Star Wars but went out of the theater frustrated and mad. Force awakens wasnt perfect but it did a fine tie in\/introductions. Without stating spoilers I can just say not only is it my least favorite and despite watching all others regularly this one I don't see ever watching again. Maybe JJ can salvage the next one.","true":true}
