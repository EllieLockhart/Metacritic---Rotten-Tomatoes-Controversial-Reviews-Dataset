Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming! This film tries to hard to be different then the rest. It has know idea what it wants to be. This film has serious plot holes and a complete disregard for its roots. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but.....skip the film. :(","true":true}
