Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great writing. Great cast. Where do you begin with a film that is this great. Rian Johnson came up with an amazing story and his cast did a terrific job of putting it together. This film answers the big question from The Force Awakens in a great way. We learn about what happened between Kylo and his mentor Luke. We learn the true nature of Rey's past. All with amazing twists and turns. I can't recommend this film enough.","true":true}
