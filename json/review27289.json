Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only had two problems with the movie (spoilers) and one of them isn't even that big of a problem to me. \\n1) The movie had too many jokes for a Star Wars movie. All the jokes were hilarious so I'm not that mad about it. It's not even a bad thing\\, just personal opinion that there were too many jokes for what it was.\\n2) That stupid ass Leia flying in space scene\\, I'm sure everybody else has complained about this already but damn how did the director get away with that lol","true":true}
