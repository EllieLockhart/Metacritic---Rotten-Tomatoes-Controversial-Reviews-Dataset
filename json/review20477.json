Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan for my entire life\\, then this movie happened.  The Last Jedi was so bad that it actually killed my interest in any new installments.  Acting was fine\\, cinematography was very good\\, but the plot\\, characters\\, dialog and pacing all were abominable.   This isn't just the worse Star Wars movie\\, it's one of the worst movie's this year.   Honestly\\, I've seen every movie in the franchise at least 5 times\\, I will never watch TLJ ever again.  It was painfully awful.  Save your money\\, and your childhood and don't see this movie.","true":true}
