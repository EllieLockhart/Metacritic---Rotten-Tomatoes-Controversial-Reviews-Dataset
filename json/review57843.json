Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching the first time\\, I left stunned and confused. \u201cIs this where they\u2019re going with SW?\u201d I really wanted to like it and so I let the movie settle in my mind\\, watched the reviews on YT come in and decided to watch it a second time. I came away feeling somewhat resolved in the movie\\, but after going home\\, I came away still feeling the same as the initial reaction. Not surprised by the drop in box office\\, as word of mouth spread rapidly. As a fan\\, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a nice movie but it misses in delivering to a common audience\\, as is evident by the polarized ratings. If SW wants to get back it\u2019s audiences\\, new and old generations \\, it needs to stay in the middle and find popular commonalities.","true":true}
