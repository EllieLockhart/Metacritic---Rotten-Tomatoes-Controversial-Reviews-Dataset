Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie... The storyline of not having one family bloodline bringing balance leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I guess they wanted to establish that the Force is not limited to only Jedi's and that anyone can be born with the Force. Maybe in the beginning of the movie Paige used the force before dying. \\nAlso maybe Finn Force sensitive and doesn't realize it.","true":true}
