Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the original trilogy\\, Han started off as a self-centered pirate but grew and developed into a selfless hero.  In the Force Awakens\\, the writers had him regressing into a selfish pirate again and then killed him.  Luke started off as a whiny\\, ignorant farm boy but grew into a mature hero who was the only one who could see the spark of good in an evil person.  In The Last Jedi\\, the filmmakers have Luke regressing back into a whiny\\, ignorant old man--and then they kill him.  Thanks for making all of our heroes come back 30 years later and look like washed-out\\, hopeless idiots.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a slap in the face.  To see Luke Skywalker toss his lightsaber over his shoulder in a petulant and dismissive manner is ridiculous.  Yes\\, he's disappointed in himself and he's despondent that Kylo Ren turned evil\\, but does Luke think that because he thinks it's time for the Jedi to end that Kylo Ren will just disappear?  That isn't Luke!\\n\\nIn addition to this major character disappointment\\, this movie is full of random pointless things.  For example\\, a major part of the plot is Poe having Finn and Rose go on a quest to get a code from a guy on another planet\\, etc\\, etc\\, because he thinks that the Purple Haired Lady doesn't have a plan.  But\\, really\\, she does have a plan and I couldn't sense any logical reason why she shouldn't tell Poe what it is.  So\\, Finn and Rose go on a quest that ends up being futile anyway.  A far-fetched plot that didn't really make sense.\\n\\nKylo Ren blasted Luke's astral-projection with all that fire power and Luke\\, of course\\, walked away unscathed.  Five seconds later\\, Finn says to Poe \\\"It's one man against an army\\, we've got to go help him!\\\"  Ummm\\, did you not see him just get blasted by all those cannons and come out unharmed?  He's going to be okay.\\n\\nI felt like I went through a painful divorce in 1999 when The Phantom Menace came out.  The Last Jedi gives me similar feelings.","true":true}
