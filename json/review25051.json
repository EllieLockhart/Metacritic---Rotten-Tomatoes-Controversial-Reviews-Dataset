Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My two boys had warned me to bring a barf bag when i saw the movie. I thought they were using hyperbole but when i saw Leia hurtling through the vacuum of space i felt my stomach turn. Wow. Where do you begin. The acting was poor and disjointed. The story threw away all the interesting concepts that Abrahms set up. Completely ruined Luke. Ruined Snoke. Brought back characters to have them killed in pointless deaths as if to say nothing mattered before this movie. Where do they go from here? I have no idea but the next director could put a 3 hour blank screen and compared to this would be a stroke of genius. I asked for my money back. They wont refund. Disney should turn all profits of this over to starving kids. At least something good would come from it","true":true}
