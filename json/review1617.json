Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time star wars Fan i have never walked out of a star wars movie quite as disappointed as with this one! In my opinion WAY worse that the prequels! Feels like a bunch of nobodies playing star wars in a Disney theme park!  Horrible desecration of the Star Wars name! I mean how do you destroy a character like Luke Sky-walker? Why can Rey suddenly not act? Why are Poe and Finn trying to one up each others cringe worthy attempts at humour? Where is snokes backstory? The force awakens was not great by any standard but this movie falls so far below the bar! The room has better acting and story than this! \\nSo disappointed.... star wars seems to be dead!","true":true}
