Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only is this by far the worst Star Wars movie\\, it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Never have I seriously considered walking out of a movie before I even hit the halfway mark. If you consider yourself a committed Star Wars fan and know the original trilogy by heart\\, don't see this movie\\, pretend it doesn't exist. Rian Johnson has killed this franchise. I found myself laughing not at the forced comic relief at the worst possible moments but at how Rian Johnson ruined any possible character arc JJ abrams planned for the main characters. When I saw TFA\\, I was indifferent but I respected what JJ did. He created an air of mystery\\, brought back some magic and hope to the franchise\\, which hadn't been done since the original trilogy. If anyone reads this review and you haven't seen it yet. Please for the love of god save yourself the time. Honestly this movie makes you respect the prequels so much more at least Lucas tried to stay true to the story. I would rather watch an origin story on jar jar binks while simultaneously squeezing a mixture of lemon juice and salt water from a sponge Into my eyes with one hand while rubbing my balls with a cheese grader with the other hand than rewatch this movie. Rian Johnson has made me question my life. I'm not sure I can go on anymore.","true":true}
