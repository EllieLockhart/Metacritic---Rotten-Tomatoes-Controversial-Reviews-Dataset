Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was a slap in the face to Star Wars fans. Disney had so much potential with the series following TFO and plenty of source material inherited from the extended universe but elected to troll us all with lame humour\\, numerous plotholes and total lack of depth. I hope it isn't the final nail for the franchise but it will be hard to redeem. Good luck for ep 9 JJ.","true":true}
