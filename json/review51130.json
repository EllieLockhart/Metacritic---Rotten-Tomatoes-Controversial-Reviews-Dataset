Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible. Apparently Luke Skywalker is up on his American pop culture gestures and Finn must have seen eturn of the Jedi because he made a reference to a line from that movie. How is this movie getting such high scores from the critics? Half way through I just wanted it to be over. There were two plot lines that had absolutely nothing to do with driving the story forward. The Admiral Haldo character was completely irrelevant and should have been cut before final script. As well as the Canto Bight story which looked as crappy as some of the shit in the prequels. Again\\, it did nothing to drive the story forward and just made the film drag on. Without these plot lines the film could have been closer to two hours and much more enjoyable. I was hoping Rian was going to make a more serious and darker Star Wars movie but nope. There were way too many cheesy jokes and one liners. Haven\u2019t we had enough of this? ","true":true}
