Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Every one of these new Star Wars films has quite the legacy to live up too. Not only must the film continue the tale that began so perfectly with the original trilogy\\, it has to appease old fans and bring in the new ones without having anyone feel alienated. It's a mean feat to try and pull off and Force Awakens certainly got the ball rolling. This movie is that ball rolling at lightning speed with a passion that lives in every single frame of the 150-minute runtime. Every frame is filled with a kind of energy that drags you in and takes you along for the films incredible ride.","true":true}
