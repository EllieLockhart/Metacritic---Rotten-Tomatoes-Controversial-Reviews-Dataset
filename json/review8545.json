Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First initial walking out of the theatre the superb visuals got me pumped but as I though more and more the movie became a disgusting mess that is garbage through and through. The only decent parts of the Movie are the opening space battle minus the jokes\\, Rey and Ben's team up minus the whole Snoke is dead thing. Movie ruins all of Star War's cannon by making Ben Solo turn to the Dark Side because Luke was feeling very Prequel and needed to kill some youngling\\, at least Vader did it while they were awake. Wait for clips of the good scenes on youtube and skip this worthless addition to Star Wars.","true":true}
