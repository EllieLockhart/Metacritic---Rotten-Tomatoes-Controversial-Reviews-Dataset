Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I watched TLJ I didn't particularly like it. It felt disconnected from the previous film and I still feel that way. However\\, after watching it two more times I now like the movie in spite of some of its issues. It's a decent addition the Star Wars\\, but would have been better if Johnson had stuck to what JJ had set up in the previous film.","true":true}
