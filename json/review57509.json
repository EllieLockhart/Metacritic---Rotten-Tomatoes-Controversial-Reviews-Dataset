Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a disney princess movie in many part. Ther was some good parts tough. It was very modern to painted some competent woman leaders\\, who are humans\\, and made mistakes but brave to make choices and can forgive.The very creative usage of the lightsabers was very good. \\nThe main antagonists was idiots. Some of the characters was not coherent with the Force Awakens in personality. Hux is the most bizarre change for example. Become a tipical Disney Evil like Jaffar or Ursuala etc. Hard to believe that people in the first order survived the destruction of the Empire reorganize itself and destroyed the New Republic with that childish behaviour. That is a caricature.  \\nAlso very-very black and white the two sides. But the loss of men are weightless. Almost all the rebels killed\\, but it just weightless like the new characters. \\nAnd that moment the bulshit about love with Finn after the crash\\, that just stupid and sentimental. \\nCharacter of Ren started to change and develop but that destroyed by the childish behaviour what fits for a classic disney main evil. \\nIn the world where is heavy weight stories are poppular and succes in money like Game of Thrones\\, Logan etc. why affraid to make a propper dramatic movie. All the elements of the classi Star Wars died out from this. This is become a caricature of SW. Distorted and bended to maximalize the profit.","true":true}
