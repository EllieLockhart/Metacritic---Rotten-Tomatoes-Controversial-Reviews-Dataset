{"101487":155488,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My new take on the new Star Wars movies (aside from Solo and Rogue One\\, which are good)\\, is that Disney\\, JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson have killed Star Wars. For Last Jedi: changing too much without showing what happened to get us from point A to point B\\, I.e.: bad storytelling. For example\\, I do not mind curmudgeon Luke\\, but HOW did he get this way??? Same issue with Luke almost killing his nephew -- how did it come to this point? This should be handled differently. Bad storytelling and character information omission...... Original review:::::::::: so\\, basically\\, it's pretty good. Honestly\\, the more I watch it the worse it gets. it's too... disjointed from the feeling and choices of the other movies. Feels like a parody of itself\\, and on that level -- it's awesome! This would be the best Star Wars parody ever! While researching reviews on this movie\\, I've listened to several fan fiction versions of how to fix this film. These are versions of The Last Jedi\\, re-imagined. If these more 'Star Warzy' ideas were combined with the interesting base that Rian laid down\\, this movie could have blown our socks off! It leaves me feeling like there's a large missed opportunity\\, here... but\\, oh well\\, someone will just make a new version. Right? :-) What must be added: 1. Kylo kicking some azz\\, at least somewhere in the universe! All we see of him is whining\\, angst\\, and not much evil results. But we are expected to believe that he's this amazing bad ass\\, at face value. back it up! 2. A better explanation to Rey\\, from Luke\\, about his past or about the Empire. Include stories about Han\\, Ben\\, Leah\\, or Darth Vader -- tying it together with questions she has. These segue opportunities are everywhere\\, and Rian didn't use any of these chances. The fan fiction folks have used these chances\\, and it's great! Someone at Disney\\, please employ some of these fan fiction guys so you can use their script ideas\\, PLEASE! 3. Actual training! Do we seriously have to see Rey as a Mary Sue??? Can we at least show some physical training along with the weird philosophy lessons? show SOME skills that need to be learned\\, so we can believe that Rey is as good as she's supposed to be. Again: back it up! It all seems so simple. Why is it so hard to make this movie good? ","true":true}
