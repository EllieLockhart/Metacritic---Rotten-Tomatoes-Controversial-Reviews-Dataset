Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent stand-alone sci fi movie  - terrible star wars movie. Destroyed the character of Luke\\, ruined all the build up of mystery from TFA\\, and finally threw away Snoke (which had potential of being an awesome character). And Rose and Finn storyline was a filler\\, seems like they just wanted to use those in the movie - and crammed them in.","true":true}
