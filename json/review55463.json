Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Moments of potential. Too many moments of WTF face-palm.\\nFour abysmal moments:\\n1. Slow-motion space chase? Imperial fleet couldn't jump away\\, then jump back and be right on top of the rebels?  If not\\, then any ship\\, going at full speed\\, is untouchable!?\\n2. Leia can suddenly f*$%ing fly\\, not freeze\\, and not explode in space?\\n3. Bombers can 'drop' bombs?  Which direction is down\\, again?\\n4. Kamikaze light-speed\\, why isn't everyone using it!?  Movie just 'invented' an insane weapon -- one small ship can take out a gigantic ship.  So\\, rebels lost multiple ships running out of fuel\\, why didn't they turn one around!?  \\\"like 9\/11 times 2\\,356\\\"","true":true}
