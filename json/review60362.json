The story is overall a dumpster fire. It could've been good even with the characters present but they had to pander to the Left wing twitter mob and the Alphabet soup+ community. If they'd just kept with the old protagonist being gay and going forward with broad questions with no answers like \\\"How do we rebuild soceity?\\\" \\\"What should it be based off of?\\\" and instead of punishing those who embrace religion show that many people may move towards it. In a crisis or post-crisis world that people don't understand they'll inevitably turn towards some greater meaning then themselves. It could've been a neat or interesting arc to explore but they wasted it by pandering. I hope the people who wrote this game never touch a pen and paper again\\, for nothing they'll ever write will be cared for by the people.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
