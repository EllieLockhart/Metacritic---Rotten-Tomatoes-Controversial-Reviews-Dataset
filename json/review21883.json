{"101487":148456,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just not very good.  I thought the music was good and the performances of Driver and del Toro were notably good\\, and the special effects were good.\\n\\nBut the plot had too many holes\\, it seemed like at least one per scene.  The dialog was generally bland\\, with a heavy dose of confusing.  The themes were a little different\\, which wouldn't be bad except that they were executed poorly.  I'll give a few examples of these complaints\\, but again\\, literally every scene had a fault.\\n\\nThe scene where vice admiral Holdo went light speed into the first order fleet looked nice.  But why didn't the other ships do that before they ran out of fuel?  Why haven't other ships done that for the entire series?  There's no answer.  You could say that it was incredibly unlikely to actually work\\, but the first order were sure afraid once the ship started to turn.  Add to that the convoluted mess that brought about the scene in the first place... first order has new tech that can track ships (a little ridiculous itself\\, but I don't want to digress too much) - rebel ships run away at sub-light speeds\\, which burns a lot of fuel (kinda surprising that is a concern\\, but again\\, digression) - Holdo makes it appear like the rebels will just keep running till they are out of fuel\\, then bail on unarmored transports to keep running - Fin\/Rose go to a relatively close planet where a hackerman who can disable the tracking temporarily if he gets on the  flagship (though every capital ship has the capability apparently\\, they just use one at a time)\\, miraculously they get a hackerman (different than planned) on board the flagship but they get caught\\, and hackerman overheard the rebel plan to cloak transports (cloaking\\, really?) due to some really bad information security on the part of fin\/rose and the first order start obliterating 90% of the rest of the rebels.  Oof.\\n\\nThe throne room scene is another contender for best scene in the movie.  Driver is solid and showcases a dark lord's expected ambitions.  The elite guard evoked a samurai film\\, almost like a 'Kill Bill' fight sequence.  But again\\, there are some major problems.  Why is Rey so powerful?  This film takes place immediately after TFA and this scene takes place just days after Rey goes to Luke for training.  Which makes it a couple weeks after Rey gets a lightsaber.  And after a grand total of two non-lightsaber force lessons\\, Rey is defeating multiple elite guard enemies with a lightsaber.  The film goes onto say that Rey doesn't have a special backstory\\, she was a solitary scavenger who had been sold into slavery by her now deceased parents.  I think the message was supposed to be that 'it doesn't matter who your parents are or where you come from'\\, but it comes across as a more 'if you are naturally gifted\\, you need very little training'.\\n\\nSeveral scenes feature Hamill as a disillusioned jedi master hermit.  Like Obiwan before him\\, Luke is pretty upset that one of his pupils went dark.  He justifies his self imposed exile by saying the jedi are as bad as the sith\\, so he will not train any jedi.  So the Jedi\\, who have been fairly reasonable in every movie\\, with fairly noble goals of peace\\, justice and harmony are as bad as the sith who destroy entire planets?  The jedi are as bad as some of the worst genocidal maniacs... because they failed to stop those genocidal maniacs?  It seems like a very emotional\\, young adult argument to make\\, at best.\\n\\nI could go on and on\\, but suffice it to say\\, every scene has fundamental flaws.  From all over casino world\\, to the opening fight\\, to force Leia and beyond... there are glaring problems.  Even the humor is generally at the expense of the story.  I would say this feels like fan fiction because everything is slightly off\\, but you'd expect a little more respect of the source material (think rogue one).  It's more like someone who isn't a particular fan is forced to make a movie about star wars.  I will say that it leaves me with a rather morbid curiosity in regards to what they do with episode 9.  I'm kinda hoping that JJ Abrams finds another wormhole to go back in time\\, or that this was largely a 'force premonition'\\, or to just inject a heavy dose of \\\"Fringe\\\"\\, but I won't be holding my breath.","true":true}
