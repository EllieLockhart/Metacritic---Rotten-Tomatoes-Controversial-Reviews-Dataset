Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great film with lots of unexpected twists. I think a lot of the backlash on RT is mainly from fanboys who didn't like that their particular theories weren't borne out in the final release. But to everyone else\\, enjoy the ride. I saw it in the UK last nigh and there was applause at the end from the audience. That doesn't happen very often with our far more reserved audiences!","true":true}
