Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(No spoilers) Ignore the bad reviews. This is a great film and my favorite Star Wars of all of the trilogies. This one had a much more original concept than episode VII and keeps you hooked the whole time. Great movie. Seriously can\u2019t understand why anyone wouldn\u2019t like it. Also\\, I thought that I\u2019d hate the porgs\\, but I ended up loving them. There are also some frog\/ nun creatures which look like a bad acid trip that are pretty funny. ","true":true}
