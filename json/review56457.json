Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The divisiveness of these audience reviews says more about the divisiveness in our culture nowadays than it does about this film. See it for yourself. For those disappointed that the film didn't act out all of your fantasies\\, try writing some fan fiction of your own. What is the point of a film that can't surprise you\\, that only plays out the wish fulfillment of fanboys? The film has a few small blemishes\\, but nothing significant - particular when compared to most of the other nine Star Wars films to date. It challenges us to grow beyond just the story of the Skywalkers\\, to let some of the past go\\, to think more about the future. But see it and make up your own mind. If you hate it\\, fair enough\\, and hey\\, at least you can keep watching the old movies from the comfort of your own home. For my part\\, I loved it\\, and I'm a huge Star Wars fan from 1977 on. I even have a soft spot for the Holiday Special. I've seen The Last Jedi twice already and have plans to see it again.","true":true}
