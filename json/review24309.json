Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Might as well just call it SJW Wars the Movie.  There is literally too much wrong with this movie even to post here.  Luke\\, the person who tried to give basically Space Hitler (Vader) a second chance\\, now tried to kill his nephew for wrongthink before he even does anything evil.  Mary Sue is OP in spite of receiving almost no training (It was a major plot point that Luke didn't finish his training\\, and so he wasn't ready to fight the dark side).  The commanders on the alleged 'good' side are completely untrustworthy and authoritarian to their subordinates.  The bad guys are a parody of what a comic bad guy is supposed to be with zero substance or nuance.  Not just that\\, but it's all SJW bs... All evil characters are white men\\, all 'good' characters are all women or minorities (who are not nearly good enough actors to make their parts not suck).  There are only 3 Star Wars movies in my opinion.  These movies don't count\\, just like the Third Godfather","true":true}
