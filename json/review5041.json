Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"crazy storyline\\, destruction of all SW previous movies and total Lore : they have no meaning as we see here - we must drop anything Jedi\\, the Force\\, the Physics\\, the characters\\, the history etc. So\\, this is no Star Wars.\\nThis is like animated video story\\, for kids on sunday morning... and then they switch to BenTen","true":true}
