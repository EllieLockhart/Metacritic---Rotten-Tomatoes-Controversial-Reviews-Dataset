Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointing movie\\, had so many problems. I though I went to see star wars\\, but instead I got Guardians of the Galaxy 3. It had some cool moments\\, the hyperspace jump into the star destroyers was pretty epic. The whole casino subplot was pointless and felt more like a generic sci fi instead of star wars. This movie was full of Disney shit\\, the crappy birds like creatures was clearly inserted in there to sell plushies. It had way to many jokes and it made the movie feel like another marvel movie. The Leia floating in space was fucking atrocious and Luke scene at the end was pointless. Why force project yourself if you are going to die anyways? I can keep going on and on of how bad the movie was. Too be clear I've enjoyed every Star Wars movie that has come out.","true":true}
