Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney should stop making movies. My past is dead thanks to this movie - thank God I didn't waste money to see this in the theatres because enduring it on Netflix was painful enough and it took me 3 nights of sickness to get through it. What's with the purple hair -LOL.  Really if you're going to destroy a franchise\\, might as well go out with a big laugh about incompetency with the director down to the hairdresser.  The supposed film critics that are giving this a tomato have no idea what they're talking about and it is as if the world has gone MAD.  This doesn't even deserve a half star...","true":true}
