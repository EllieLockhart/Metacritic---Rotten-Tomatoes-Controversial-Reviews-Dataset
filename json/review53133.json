Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome movie I loved the cute little porgs. It's so cool that they were based on the real puffins on the island where they filmed. BB8 driving the AT ST was epic.","true":true}
