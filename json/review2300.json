Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A tremendously disappointing film that runs overlong\\, is crammed with bad humor\\, and tragically retells the heroic Luke Skywalker character as a grizzled old failure\\, drooling blue milk down his beard. This was the end of Star Wars for me.","true":true}
