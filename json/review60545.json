Outside of combat players can immerse themselves in the story of the characters\\, or just roam around enjoying the scenery.Naughty Dog is a company that always pays attention to detail\\, from dust on window-seals\\, to scratch marks on surfaces. While not ever scene is eye-candy\\, the grotesque scenes are still a masterpiece.What you put into this game you get back\\, so if collectables are your thing\\, you will thoroughly enjoy exploring the world of Last Of Us Part 2. And if not\\, you can bypass them and still enjoy the length and very moving story.Thank you Naughty Dog\\, this is my first review and your game has given me a reason to write one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
