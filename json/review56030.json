Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow and corny\\, with strange 'twist' style humor inserted regularly at the most unlikely and unwanted opportunities will make fans want to vomit but may leave the average movie goer chuckling about as much as an 80's 'buddy comedy'. Easily the most disappointing and poorly written of all Star Wars including including flawed Phantom Menace\\, (Remember Young Aniken\\, Midiclorians and Jar Jar Binks). Acting is good all round\\, casting- very below par... for visuals\\, music and effects it is a 5\/10... for story and dialogue\\, character\/set\/vehicle design... it's a 2\/10. So split the difference for total score- 3\/10. It made me walk out of the cinema feeling hopeless and depressed. I can really understand the people that cried\\, it was so disappointing\\, and I have had other reboots and sequels of my favorite franchises (Terminator\\, Predator\\, Robocop\\, Ghostbusters\\, to name a few) be really terrible\\, but this... it would have been so EASY to write a cool and satisfying installment... but Rian Johnson had to have his own 'weird humor' every 5 minutes or so (usually during drama?) seemingly just to entertain himself? There was SO many inconsistencies\\, mistakes and missed opportunities\\, I honestly think Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy will end up costing Disney over 3 BILLION when you count the short fall of this movie\\, the massive amounts the #SoloBoycott lost due to fan hatred of this movie and the #Episode9Boycott #EpisodeIXBoycott in 2019 still to come...","true":true}
