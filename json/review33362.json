Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SWJs and Disney are ruining Star Wars. They don't seem to realize that the direction of their characters takes away from the plot\\, and makes them less relatable to the audience. All this \\\"past must die\\\" rhetoric that they talk about in the new films is exactly what they are doing to the stories of Star Wars...killing it\\, tearing down the legacy and building a big crappy SJW statue on the remains.","true":true}
