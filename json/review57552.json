Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't the film the fandom expected. It doesn't spoon feed you the plot. It doesn't rely on archetype and it inverts tropes. It challenges and confronts Star Wars fans to view the universe a little deeper. It is a fantastic ride with easily the best character development of any film including the original trilogy. Fans confused by what they saw will come around as they have a chance to settle in and understand what Rian was doing.","true":true}
