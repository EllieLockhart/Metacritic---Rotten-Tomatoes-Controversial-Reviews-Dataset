We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"What a master piece!I have read some poor comments about this game\\, all I have to say is...what an immature collection of people!In this review I will not discuss the development of graphics or mechanics of this game\\, because they are just perfect\\, has is the sound\\, environment and voice acting!- Congratulations from a Software Engineer.I will although defend the story of this amazing game\\, a story that everyone seems to miss the point. I am tired of classic stories where a character we love gets killed and we have to simply avenge him\\, this story is a lot of things\\, but simple is not one them!I found myself not wanting to see what the game had to show me\\, not because of negative things\\, but because this game touched my feelings like no game has ever done before! This game doesn\u2019t just tell the story of Joel and Ellie but puts the player in the mind of the people that are actually in an apocalypse! You start the game angry and wanting revenge for what happen to Joel\\, you follow Ellie\u2019s point of view\\, where everything you are doing seems right! You think \u201cThese people deserve it\u201d!But then the game touches in your deep feelings and twists them by making you play with Abby...\u201dwhat a low blow\u201d... I first thought\\, but it was in fact genius! Abby is so much like Ellie\\, and more than that...she is so much like Joel! When you get to the end of Abby\u2019s days in the beautiful city of Seattle\\, you end up with the fact that...\u201ddamn...she is actually a good person\u201d...and so are the kids from the Scars and so is Ellie and Joel...and that\u2019s where the simulation of the apocalypse comes in...the main characters of this story are not bad people at all...just people fighting for different things in a **** up world...I ended this game having to admit to myself that if anyone acted badly...was my favorite character...Joel...love makes you choose in a selfish way...The end of this game...is about grief...and both Ellie and Abby lost more then they gain with revenge...Abby lost her friends\\, Ellie lost the opportunity of a family and happiness...but in the end she managed to make piece and say goodbye to Joel in a last song...just...beautiful...Such an original story...like I have never seen before\\, I could never predict anything on this game!It\u2019s time that games enter in a new era\\, with new stories and emotions! And it\u2019s time that us\\, gamers\\, open our minds for what the game has to show us and not for what we wanted to see!Naughty Dog...thank you!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
