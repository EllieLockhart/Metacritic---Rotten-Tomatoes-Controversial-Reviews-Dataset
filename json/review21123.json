Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so psyched for this movie however after seeing it I was highly disappointed. I don't understand how these professional critics gave it such a great rating when there so many potholes and a sloppily put together movie it makes me wonder who Disney has on their payroll. To be honest The Phantom Menace might have been better!","true":true}
