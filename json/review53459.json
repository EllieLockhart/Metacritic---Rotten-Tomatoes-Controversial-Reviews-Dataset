Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney you literally ripped out the soul and hear from Star Wars and took spike shoes and just stompped on it.\\nShame on you.\\nAs someone who has seen every Star Wars Movie multiple times in movie theaters and bought every Star Wars movie that came out...This has not been the case with this.\\nI cannot\\, and will not watch this movie a second time! \\nAnd I will not! see the last movie or the Solo movie; it breaks my heart too.\\n* I've seen all the movies multiple times.\\n* Played the games\\n* Read the books and comics.\\nAND BOY! this movie Sucked!\\n\\nMy roommate has just saw The Last Jedi about a week ago and he was laying into this film like I've never seen before. I didn't think much into it because I'm someone who likes to watch a movie or play a game before coming up with my own point of view.\\n........\\n....\\n...\\nUnfortunately he was right\\, I absolutely hated this abomination.\\nI have no idea what the Critics were smoking when they decided to give The Last Jedi 91% at the time of this viewing; its as if they completely ignored the dozens and dozens of just awful awful writing in the film.\\nI honestly done know where to start but I'll make it short and simple.\\n1: I hated how they handled Luke\\, seriously what the in the hell did i just see...I don't mind that he died\\, I just absolutely hate how they saw and handled his character. It wasn't smart\\, it wasn't clever. it wasn't new\\, it was just awful and cringy.\\n2: you cannot weaponize hyper space! Straight up\\, I burst out laughing in my movie theater! \\n3: The Humor Was AWFUL!\\n4: Hollow Characters\\, everyone in the movie felt hollow\\, I didn't care about' Rei\\, Fin\\, Poe\\, Luke\\, or Leia and this was a shame because toward the end of the force awakens\\, I was really interested...now I could care less! I Do Not Care about seeing the last movie\\, In Fact I wont watch the last movie because it was such a bad movie.","true":true}
