Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS. Was sad that they ruined Luke's cannon. Loved how the ship can stay just far away enough to avoid main weaponry but their pursuers can't get just a little closer. Lack of explanation on Snoke (and possibly Rey) was frustrating. Was annoyed they killed off admeral akbahr so casually. Same with Captian Phasma. Same with Snoke. Same with all of the Snoke disciples. Hated that the code breaking story\\, which consumed 30 mins of screen time\\, is completely new irrelevant to the plot.","true":true}
