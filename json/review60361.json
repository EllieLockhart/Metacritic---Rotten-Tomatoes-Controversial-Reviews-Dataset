Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I dont even know what to say. I wouldn't rate 0% because the game itself is pretty good and the actors did their best\\, but the story wich is the most important part\\, is trash.Ellie kills hundreds of innocent people to get to the Abby who killed Joel\\, only to get her fingers bitten off an letting Abby go. Also Abby is a very annoying character. The game also felt way less emotional then the first one. The  way how one character after another dies is just stupid. Also it was really bad how they handeled rhe clifhanger when you have to play as abby and abby's part was really bad. Way too many uninteresting characters wich all die. Also the story jumps way too much back and forth. They also made Ellie dirty and represented her in the worst way possible. Also they could've made an end that's a least a little happy to don't make the player feel like crap but no. Ellie loses her fingers and everyone she loves. Now she lives her greatest fear of beeing alone in the world. They atleast could have madw something like that she gets a left handed guitar so that she can still play it but no. Everything about the story is bad. Shame on Neil Druckmann!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
