Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couldn't have made a more perfect movie. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the movie at all. Continued the story. I'm sure the final movie will be the best. The best is yet to come.","true":true}
