Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My love for Star Wars is unconditional and knows no bounds. With that said\\, I support The Last Jedi to my best abilities and give it the highest score possible here. I'm happy that Star Wars is alive and well again after all the years of them saying it was over. Bring on Episode IX!!","true":true}
