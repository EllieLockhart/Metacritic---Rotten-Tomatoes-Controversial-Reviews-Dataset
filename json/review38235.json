Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were great. I enjoyed the fight scenes. That's about it. I'm not going to put spoilers in here but I didn't like the direction they went with some of the characters. They could have at least let us know more about Snoke. I like Rey but I still don't know how she can be so proficient in the force without any training. I like Finn but I found his side mission with Rose boring. Disappointed there wasn't more Captain Phasma. Can't really talk about more without adding spoilers so I'll just say I was disappointed with the movie.","true":true}
