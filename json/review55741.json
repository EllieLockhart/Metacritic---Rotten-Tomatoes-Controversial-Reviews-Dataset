Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over 40 year fan! I found this entertaining and really enjoyable! Some people are way too critical and sensitive! See it on the big screen! You\u2019ll enjoy it! Seriously! Go see this movie. You'll enjoy it. I'm almost 50. I've seen them all. Too many sensitive and critical people review this and are driving the rating down. That's too bad. Wahhhhh. I think people forgot what a whimp Luke was in every single episode right up until the end. Always whining and needing to be pushed. Go back and watch. Give me a break. Leia was always stronger. This film is full of surprises. It had a lot more comedy than I would have expected\\, but maybe the jokes just landed better than the cheesy jokes in the older films (sorry George). There's a ton of scenes that will put a nice heartwarming smile on your face and a bunch that will make you go WOW! I plan on seeing it again!","true":true}
