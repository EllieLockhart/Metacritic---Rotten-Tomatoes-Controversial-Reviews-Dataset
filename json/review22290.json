Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi fails both as a sequel and as a standalone film\\, which is unfortunate because there was a lot to look forward to given the quality of TFA being pretty good. It doesn't answer questions raised by the previous films or falls flat trying to\\, especially with some of the most important questions. Characters who seemed to be of importance are thrown to the sidelines\\, new characters come across as a little one dimensional. Plenty of subplots could either have been removed or easily improved\\, particularly one involving Finn. Alongside this\\, the pacing is unnecessarily fast and the editing is an unfortunate mess.\\n\\nAll this said\\, the film does have some merits. Some of the most interesting parts of the film question the morality of Jedi and add some complexity to an already rather complex character of Kylo Ren. Alongside this\\, there are some great action sequences and some stunning shots combined with some great sound editing. Unfortunately\\, these occupy a one-quarter portion of the film.\\n\\nOverall\\, I wouldn't watch this film unless you're a Star Wars fanatic.","true":true}
