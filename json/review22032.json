Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just watched this film again and am baffled by the hate. It's a great movie! I still feel there are a lot of unanswered questions (especially with Rey and Snoke) in this new Star Wars trilogy but I'm eager to see how it all pans out in Episode 9. If that fails to deliver I may have to revisit my feelings on all of this but as of right now I feel like The Last Jedi was the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
