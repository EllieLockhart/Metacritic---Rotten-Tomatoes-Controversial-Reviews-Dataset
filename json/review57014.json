Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This could have been a great movie. Many people are saying that \u0093fanboys\u0094 are rejecting this movie because it does not indulge their theories and the plot twists are too much to handle. I don\u0092t think that is true\\, at least not in my case. I don\u0092t mind Rey being of no specific lineage or even that Luke was not the same Luke many of us might have hoped for. There were no real plot twists in my opinion. Rey and Kylo could have had much more interesting character arcs but instead we are still left with good girl and bad guy. Now the nitty gritty wrongs I found in the movie...\\nKylo easily kills an extremely powerful Sith Lord but can barely handle his guards? \\nPo is just an immature\\, gun busting hot head in this? What a waste of a character!\\nHux\\, who gave one of my favorite performances in TFA when he gives the strong speech before firing Starkiller Base... is now a laughable goon.\\nBad\\, BAD joke after joke that always misses. \\nLeia in space\\, yea no.\\nCorny CGI animals & aliens\\, after JJ made a push for more hands on special effects for creatures in TFA.\\nRey is way too skilled with the Force without training.\\nThe casino\\, useless filler\\, if not to only introduce Benicio for possible future involvement in the series.\\nIt\u0092s just lazy filmmaking from a technical standpoint.","true":true}
