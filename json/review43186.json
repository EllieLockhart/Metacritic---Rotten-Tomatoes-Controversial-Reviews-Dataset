Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This should've been a Star Wars movie with Disney elements\\, but it is a Disney movie with Star Wars elements. HUGE DIFFERENCE. TFA was already going this way (Kylo took a hit from a stormtrooper with a light saber! In a Star Wars movie he would've just choked him\\, but there's not much action there so Disney gave us an unacceptable battle) but TLJ destroyed the OT. I feel your pain\\, Mark! If you liked the movie it's ok\\, you are a Disney fan\\, period.","true":true}
