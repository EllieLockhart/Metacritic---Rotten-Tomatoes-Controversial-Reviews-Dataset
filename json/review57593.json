Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ\\, hands down\\, is the worst movie I've ever witnessed and I've watched a good amount of terrible movies.\\n\\nBeing one of those Star Wars fans that've read the Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zahn\\, which saved Star Wars when almost nobody cared about Star Wars anymore\\, which kickstarted the EU and amongst other things\\, highly influenced Lucas himself\\, too.. which was the sequel to RotJ and considered canon until Disney decided to get rid of the EU.. being one of those fans at least for me TFA was a disaster but TLJ really is an abomination. The editing is bad\\, the writing is dreadful\\, the characters are not even slightly interesting nor rememberable. Rey is a Mary Sue by definition. Everybody who denies this is just a partisan liar or can't comprehend what a Mary Sue actually is. \\n\\nEverything about this movie would suck if it weren't for the actors. I think the actors have done the best they could with the material provided to them.. but it's just a terrible movie. \\n\\nDespite Disney being in ownership of the franchise and ultimately deciding what is considered canon\\, it's not their brainchild so many fans including myself will deny that they have the creative authority over Star Wars. I consider Rogue One (which was watchable)\\, TFA\\, TLJ and other upcoming movies like that Solo movie (considering all we know by now.. it will probably suck\\, too..) as mere fan fiction.\\n\\nI'm glad we still have the expanded universe with countless of good written\\, high quality\\, actually believable stories.","true":true}
