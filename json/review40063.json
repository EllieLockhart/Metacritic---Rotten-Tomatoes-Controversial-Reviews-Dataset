Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my personal favourite of the sequel trilogy\\nIt is full of unpredictability\\, exciting scenes and builds up the characters well\\, especially the interesting plot between Rey and Kylo Ren.\\nIt follows on well from The Force Awakens.\\nIt is certainly action packed\\, and therefore may take a couple of viewings to fully understand what is going on.","true":true}
