Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were certain parts of this movie I really enjoyed and then others not so much.  Why leave a map if you didn't want anyone to find you?   Princess Leia should have been killed off two chances to do it to and they didn't.  We never find out much about Snoke.  For a powerful alien he wasn't very smart.  What was his background story.  Rey's parents after all the flashbacks and then nothing.  What happened to the knights of ren? The throne room scene should of been near the end of the movie. The Luke scene with Kylo was good but should of been for the final episode.  I didn't mind how they portrayed Luke can you blame him after seeing how powerful the dark side is?  Good luck to JJ Abrams there isn't much to go with for episode 9.  Disney changed   Star Wars for the worse as of right now.","true":true}
