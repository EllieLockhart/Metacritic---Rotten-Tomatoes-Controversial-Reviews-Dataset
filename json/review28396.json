Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Posters depicting menstrual blood dripping from clitoris-shaped hooded Luke Skywalker should have hinted at the not-so-hidden female supremacy agenda  pushed by the own-gender-hater BDSM-slave Rian Johnson and feminazi Kathleen Kennedy...
