Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun\\, deep\\,powerful\\, respectful to the legacy and a wide open door for a new generation of star wars fans. Also beautifully shot\\, emotionally driven action sequences and a great sense of discovery in the universe we know and love. All of this comes from a great direction from Rian Johnson from a totally different and fresh point of view. Definitely by no means a flawless movie that had pacing issues but still a great watch. I respect the negative reviews but the way is it this movie does not deserve a 53% audience score. ","true":true}
