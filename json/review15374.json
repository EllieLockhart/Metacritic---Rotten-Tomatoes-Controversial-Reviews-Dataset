Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love all of the Star Wars films\\, including the prequels\\, and this one didn't disappoint. My husband on the other hand wasn't a fan of The Force Awakens and some of the prequels. I was worried to see The Last Jedi with him because I didn't want him to put a damper on my excitement. I need not have worried. He loved it and said it's one of the best Star Wars movies ever. Even though it occasionally had  humor in it that wasn't his style\\, there was also humor in it that he loved\\,  and he enjoyed the plot twists and turns along with me. I appreciated Luke's story arc and was thrilled to see Leia finally using her force powers beyond connecting minds with Luke. The Rey and Kylo story line was excellent and kept me glued to my seat. The admiral Holdo\/Poe story line was also a fun side story. Loved this movie and already saw it twice!","true":true}
