Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I suppose that people who don\u0092t like the film are in the same group as the \u0093Han solo shot first\u0094 types. This film takes Star Wars in a different direction that although uncomfortable for some\\, it\u0092s spectacular for me.","true":true}
