Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney takes its first big step in killing the Star Wars franchise with The Last Jedi.  Whereas George Lucas mixed in marketing subtly without getting in the way of the story\\, Disney takes its typical in-your-face approach at the expense of the film.  Ewoks were needed in the story.  Porgs exist only to sell merchandise. Lucas used dialogue to advance the plot\\, throwing in an occasional comedic twist when needed.  Disney liberally throws in tongue in cheek dialogue somewhat like James Bond\\, apparently unaware viewers desire a straight forward approach to Lucas' classic good vs evil masterpiece and not the perpetual irreverence and goofballness of Bond.  Porgs partying like its 1999 during a battle\\, Leia somehow making the strangest and most out of place space walk in history\\, dialogue worthy more of Spaceballs\\, than Star Wars\\, an opening sequence that is more a failed Abbott and Costello routine (I know\\, I know: Abbott and Costello didn't make failed routines - that accentuates the fail here) than standard Star Wars fare\\, Star Wars\\, the Last Jedi ends up lost in what it wants to be and\\, in doing so\\, becomes a microcosm of itself.  George Lucas and Lucasfilm play the master story teller and cinematographer as Luke Skywalker\\, leading the Rebellion\\, tradition and respect for the story and audience against Bob Iger's Disney\\, the real life Empire\/First Order of corporate greed and marketing over substance.  We can only hope the Force prevails.","true":true}
