Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to speak about the latest Star Wars film without giving away too much\\, but let me try. Where The Force Awakens played it (mostly) safe and was more or less a remake of Episode 4\\, The Last Jedi may use known and beloved parts of Star Wars but mixes them into such a fresh\\, surprising and controversial plot\\, it's certainly the most unusual of the films. The fandom will be very split about the decisions made here\\, but at least no one played this by the numbers. The beginning is already breath-taking\\, then the film does take its time to breathe and gives its characters some space to develop. That also means by the time of the spectacular second half you deeply care about them and their fate. There are so many \\\"Holy shit\\\" scenes\\, some of which will find as much love as resentment\\, I am sure. But no one will come out of this film unshaken by what they have just seen. A worthy\\, wild\\, emotional\\, beautifully done ride. It's exciting to wonder where they'll go from here.","true":true}
