Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"sadly.... the story has lot of issues\\, some characters are written very bad...hs to much \\\"fun\\\" moments.. its to much Disney .. i mean the old movies had less \\\"fun\\\" moments.. cuz the movies where not intended to cater to children... now they try to balance out the \\\"Bad\\\" things that happen with  lighthearted fun moments..  you dont need to go dark\/edge\\, but also no need for \\\"fun\\\" moments either.. all the men are depicted  like incompetent morons... the Asian girl was just  decoration for feminists and  SJW\\,  the Girl in the Bomber looked good\\, but now.. go with the MORE AVERAGE looking bland girl\\, cuz  woman can more relater to her ... this movie bleeds from so  many wounds..  Why is it that Star Wars Rebels is Awesome ..: well written story's\\, the characters are amazing\\, int the lead cast\\, no one is made dumb JUST TO LET OTHER CHARACTERS SHINE... LET ME PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE... THIS MOVIE IS VISUALLY stunning\\, but other then that.. its  the worst Star Wars i ever seen....","true":true}
