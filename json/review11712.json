Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can such a cheesy piece of garbage can claim itself to be the inheritor of the wondrous masterpiece that Star Wars once was. The movie isn't remotely enjoyable even with your brain turned off passed one 12-beer pack. The characters are badly written\\, the plot is disheveled sequence of events filled with cliches and holes\\, the dramatic moments are always spoliated by a supposedly comedic scene. Everything from this movie inspires cringe and disgrace except from the imagery\\, the animation and the soundtrack of which the credits belong to the technical and not the creative abilities of the staff.","true":true}
