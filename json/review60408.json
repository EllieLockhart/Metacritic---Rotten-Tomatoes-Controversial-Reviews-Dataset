I played the first game and it was a 10\/10 story game for me and the gameplay was around an 8\/10. So overall the first game was a great experience.This second installment has been a complete 180 in terms of story. The game play is about the same. Only very minor things like prone\\, and dodging were added\\, while keeping the progression of game play completely linear.I'am sitting here with having completed half of the story and finally having to call it quits. I cannot take all the forced liberal undertones the game blatantly forces you to watch. There is long drawn out cut scenes that make you feel stupid after watching. The only good character was killed off within minutes of playing. Story is completely predictable and zero thought was given to make these characters have any depth rather than stereotypical revenge rage. Sad that a good story was put into a dumpster.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
