Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched it again in IMAX... and I'm so regretting it because it PISSED ME off even further. For the first time in any Star Wars film\\, I will NOT watch this piece of garbage again. For those who knows me\\, I watch all Star Wars movie multiple times with my record breaking more than 100 times for Episode 4 (A New Hope)\\, including a 7 day straight movie watching of that episode when I was kid! This movie Last Jedi destroyed everything I know about Star Wars\\, with lots of plot holes and scenes that has no sense and so stupid especially that part when selfish annoying bitch Rose fucked up Finn's heroic deed and then kissed Finn while the rebels were blown up by the first order.I was like rolling my eyes so hard I could see my brain!!! This movie was disrespectful to StarWars fans like me\\, it's lazy writing\\, politicized (what's that feminism thing?!)\\, so much waste and missed opportunities especially for Luke's character\\, etc. etc.\\, I wish this movie never existed! STAR WARS 8 : THE LAST JEDI \\, UGLY MOVIE - 1 STAR out of 5 !","true":true}
