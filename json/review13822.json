Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Rouge One was a love letter to fans\\, The Last Jedi is revenge porn. The film makers tell fans what they think of our devotion for the past 40 years through Kylo Ren: Kill the past.  Ridiculous plot holes and not just a rejection of Star Wars canon but a repudiation.  Was the Star Wars jump the shark moment when Leia survived the vacuum of space and now uses the force?","true":true}
