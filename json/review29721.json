Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson was so arrogant\\, and in such a need to make his own film\\, that he threw away everything amazing and mysterious that JJ Abrams set up with The Force Awakens. I am not a \\\"diehard\\\" Star Wars fan\\, but I enjoy the films and universe quite a bit. This film didn't feel like a sequel to the last film\\, it felt like somebody who wanted to tell their own\\, unrelated story.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi also gives us characters totally different than they were the last time we saw them\\, or has them repeat what they did in the last one. Finn is trying to run away again\\, then ends up infiltrating the enemy base\\, YET AGAIN. Poe goes from one of the most capable rebel soldiers to a liability\\, who for no reason whatsoever is kept out of the loop. Why hide the real plan from one of\\, if not your BEST soldier? \\n\\nFrom the needless and very in your face political and social commentary\\, the disregard for what JJ Abrams set up\\, and the absolutely nonsensical plot and writing\\, this is easily the worst Star Wars film\\, even worse than the prequels\\, because it doesn't even feel like a Star Wars film. I give it half a star for having one or two interesting moments.","true":true}
