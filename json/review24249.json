Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh\\, they killed all the interesting characters of the franchise. It looks like snoke is the strongest Jedi user we've ever seen and he is killed by a silly trick. Oh and apparently Masters can telehologram themselves across the galaxy. Why didnt they think of that before the clone wars... Apparently being old isn't a problem anymore either.","true":true}
