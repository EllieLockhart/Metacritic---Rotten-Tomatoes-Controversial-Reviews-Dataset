It doesn't deny the actions of the first game but makes it the thematic plot thread holding the story together.\r\rI grew with Ellie. Its been 7 years for me and 4-5 for her and the world she lives in. This is a bleak unflinching world where happiness is an afterthought. Every death seems to carry weight. every encounter weighs on me the player. The characters are fleshed out. The cinematics are perfectly synced with the action. The mythos of the world is dense. You have a society being built on the crumbs of the past. And it is as flawed as we are today. There is hope here. you go through layers and layers of despair to get to it. But that's Life personified.\r\rOn a last note. This story will stay with me for some time. I will ponder the choices made. I will fight with the pros and cons. But in the end i will wait for what comes next. Please let there be a next.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
