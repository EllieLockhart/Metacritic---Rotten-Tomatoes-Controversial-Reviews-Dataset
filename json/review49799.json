Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yep\\, it's as bad as I thought it would be.  I wasn't a fan of the Phantom Menace\\, but I only thought that that was a bad Star Wars film.  This atrocity is not a Star Wars film.  This is a really bad movie\\, but it ain't no Star Wars movie.\\n\\nI couldn't stand any of thenew characters.  The asian girl is this generation's Jar Jar.  She is just as irritating.  I also hated the in your face politics.  Leave your propaganda out of the cinema.  Why must everything have to have an agenda?","true":true}
