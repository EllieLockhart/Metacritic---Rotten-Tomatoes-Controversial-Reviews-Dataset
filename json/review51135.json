Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible. Disappointing reveals. How do you take theee most talked about questions of the last two years and completely  destroy their hype?? They could have gone in literally any other direction but chose the most boring story. \\n\\nThey relied tooooo much on CGI\\, cute animals\\, and worthless action rather than story and plot. Hate the prequels all you want\\, but at least they were multidimensional - action\\, romance\\, comedy\\, cliffhangers. \\n\\nTerrible.","true":true}
