Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers* Poorly developed plot. Kylo is still a whiny weakling. Very corny new Star Wars creatures that Disney very obviously made to sell toys. Snoke served zero purpose in the story apparently? Leia has been holding out on using the force until now? There was no epic jedi vs sith lightsaber fight. Luke died in such an odd and vague way. I\u2019m still not sure how Rey is such a powerful Jedi with zero training. I mean it took Luke and Anakin\/Vader like 3 movies each\\, and they trained in each movie\\, to become powerful like that. Star Wars has always had a powerful villain and for the past 2 movies I really can\u2019t think of one. Everything seems very kiddy. At this point I\u2019m not really sure where the franchise is going or how it is going to reroute it\u2019s current course.","true":true}
