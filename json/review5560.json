Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did Disney buy Rotten Tomatoes too? How did the critics give it such a high score?\\n\\nRan on too long. Hack jokes and gags. Ruined \\\"The Force\\\" mythos but not midichlorian bad. Unnecessary characters but not Jar Jar Binks bad. Verbose dialogue\\, but not Clone Wars bad. And don't get me started with Leia in space. WTF? Buuuut not as bad as \\\"noooooooo Vader.\\\"\\n\\nTo prove I'm not a hater\\, I did LOVE Force Awakens. Rogue One was meh. This was pffffllllarrrrrt...\\n\\nJJ get back in there and clean this franchise up!","true":true}
