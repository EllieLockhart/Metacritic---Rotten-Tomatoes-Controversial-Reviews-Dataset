Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly dreadful experience with practically nothing good about it other than the production value and Kylo finally getting some character development. \\n\\nThis movie practically singlehandedly killed off any chances of me watching a new Star Wars movie ever again\\, Disney would need to truly make something stupendous for me to even glance at a movie release of this series ever again.\\n\\nThere is one scene in this movie\\, that was so horrendously bad\\, so atrociously delusional and frankly disgusting that it actually made the movie worth watching once. The scene truly solidifies what Disney Star Wars is now. The scene I'm talking about is at the end of the film right after Rose screws Finn over and denies him an awesome ending. She says this one line\\, this one f***ing line\\, it had me fall of my seat laughing. Not because it was a \\\"joke\\\"\\, but because it made the movie a joke. I watched a 2 and a half hour long dump on Star Wars and that scene was the cherry on top of the shit pile.\\n\\nI hate you Ryan Johnson\\, I hate you feminist producer (whatever your name was)\\, I hate you Disney and fuck you especially the people who could have prevented this by poisoning Ryan Johnson's drink and getting him sick so he couldn't make this film\\, you could have saved us all from this travesty.","true":true}
