Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched Star Wars for the fist time in a movie theatre in 1977. I was 4\\, the movie was amazing\\, followed by two amazing sequels. I love Star Wars. Correction\\, I loved Star Wars. This movie destroys and betrays 40 years of Star Wars lore. Luke's character arc is so in opposition of everything Luke stood for it just baffles me to no end. The Last Jedi spits in the face of everything that is Star Wars and spits in the face of the fans\\, and then rubs it in even more by symbolically stating we should \\\"Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to.\\\" The problem Mr. Johnson is that Star Wars movies made people WANT to remember their past and the joy that came with reliving our fondest memories of watching Star Wars. The Last Jedi sadly succeeded in doing something I never thought possible\\, kill my love and passion for Star Wars. After viewing The Last Jedi I no longer care about what happens in Star Wars universe. I do not care what happens to these new characters\\, and I have no desire and can say emphatically I will never again by a movie ticket to see any future Star Wars films. Please note that this is not a knee jerk reaction\\, as I watched the movie two weeks ago and still feel this way. The box office speaks for itself and in support of my feelings. The Last Jedi now has the largest second week drop off in ticket sales of any movie ever\\, and that says it all.","true":true}
