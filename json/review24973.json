Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My main issues:\\n\\nEveryone who uses the force is incredibly powerful for no reason. Leia has unforeseen force magic ability that no-one seems to mention. Luke is super powerful despite not even using the force for years. Rey is super powerful despite being a nobody who hasn't trained. Snoke is SUPER SUPER powerful but nothing is explained about who he is\\, how he's powerful or anything at all about him really. Kylo Ren is the only one who doesn't seem that powerful and he's supposed to be the main bad guy\\, the scary \\\"monster\\\".\\n\\nThe sub-plots with Poe and Finn are pointless\\, do not advance the story at all and are generally uninteresting.\\n\\nSnoke's character is killed off way too soon and his character seems completely pointless other than copying the original trilogy\\, which this episode did A LOT but just made it worse.\\n\\nNew characters are added that we have no feelings for. The chinese girl seemed to be in it so they had people of all races and she was a pointless character and uninteresting. The purple haired woman was very annoying and I just wanted her to die so I wouldn't have to watch her in any more scenes.\\n\\nThe entire 2.5 hour movie was pretty much about 2 ships in space not moving at all.","true":true}
