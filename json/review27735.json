Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People keep saying that fans don't like it because it's different than the original Star Wars movies\\, but it's objectively a poorly executed movie. The story structure and pacing is the weakest in the franchise. The editing is sloppy and makes the decent performances of the actors fall flat. The humor makes it hard to take anything seriously. Characters and subplots setup in The Force Awakens are dropped or tossed aside with no payoff. There are massive plot holes. Luke's character is entirely inconsistent with his previous characterization in a way that makes no sense. The art design and visuals\\, while high-quality\\, feel more like generic fantasy\/sci-fi (John Carter\\, Avatar\\, etc.) than Star Wars. Porgs are the new ewoks and nothing more than a thinly veiled ploy to sell merchandise\\, as are other aspects of the movie.","true":true}
