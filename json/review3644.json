Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars since Empire! I don\u2019t know why people are hating so much. Judge the movie on what it is\\, not what you want it to be! It\u2019s a phenomenal movie\\, not what I expected\\, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about it!!!!","true":true}
