Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look\\, we all knew Luke wouldn't survive this movie\\, it is in the title\\, but the send off the film maker gave to a beloved movie character\\, an archetype of Science Fiction for 40 years is terrible. \\n\\nThat major cinematic sin alone would have just made this a popcorn filler action flick with a star wars background\\, but it gets worse. The rest of the story was a badly A\/B\/C story arc. Pacing was all over the place. Plotting also worked against the overall story\\, there was no major Revelation like you would find in Empire Strikes Back (No \\\"I am your father\\\" or Han Solo frozen in Carbonite taken by the Bounty Hunter moments)\\, and a pedantic ending where the title of the movie is a quasi meditative concept.\\n\\nWhat could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong\\, it's like Attack of the Clones Part 2. I know there were good things about this movie too and loose plot threads that could save this trilogy in the Part 3\\, but Abrams has a lot of work ahead of him\\, because hands down this was the weakest middle part of any of the Star Wars Trilogies so far. As an audience member\\, I really don't care enough to come back to this franchise\\, because you failed to give me a strong enough personal hook.","true":true}
