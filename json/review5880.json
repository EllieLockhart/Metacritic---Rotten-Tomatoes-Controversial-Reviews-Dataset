Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing culmination of legacy storytelling.  Subverted expectations in an unenjoyable way\\, deeply flawed\\, morose\\, and antithetical to the saga put forth previously.  Not worh you time and money\\, ruins any anticipation of seeing where things go from here.  Damages the brand as a whole.  A giant unerasable stain of a film.","true":true}
