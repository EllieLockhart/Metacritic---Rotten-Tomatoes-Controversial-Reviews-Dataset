Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was an amazingly rich and rewarding addition to the Star Wars saga. If you really put yourself in Rian Johnson\u0092s (the writer\/director) shoes - with the story he was given - it\u0092s easy to see that he executed the film in the most fulfilling\\, logical\\, yet unexpected way possible. \\n\\nSPOILERS: \\n\\nLuke\u0092s character arch was perfect. He learned what it really meant to be a master before dying on the island - as he said he would. Luke looking out onto the two suns - like he did in A New Hope - just before he passes\\, was very powerful. So many fantastic scenes in this film. The ones between Rey and Kylo were spectacular. \\nI loved this film!","true":true}
