Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was probably the biggest disappointment that i felt walking out of the movie theatre. The plot was just awful J J Abrams did a great job building up characters and plot for this movie but Rian Johnson i guess didn't care and troll everyone.(spoilers)I don't know why he had to ruin Luke Skywalker as character he wasn't same old childhood hero that i look up too. For reason he wanted to make Luke a coward a loser that didn't learn or grow at all as a character from the first three movies. The old Luke would never want to kill his own nephew even if he felt some darkside in him in the return of the jedi he couldn't kill his father went on a suicide mission to save him and he did saved one of the most evil villain in film history. Like what was the point of Luke leaving a map to find him in the force awakens if he doesn't want to be found. And Rey learn nothing new about her like her parents were supposed to be to be a big reveal and it turns out they are just junkies. Again way to go Rian blow another great moment that J J was setting up. He made Snoke a joke in this movie finding out he gets cut in half. I mean there's more i could go on about but you probably already heard about them by now. All in all the movie was a big mess. If i was to recommend to watch it on netflix or something or rent it home for like 5 bucks at home.","true":true}
