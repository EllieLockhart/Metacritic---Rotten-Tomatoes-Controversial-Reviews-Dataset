Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall a great movie\\, enjoyed it more than episode 1\\,2 and 7. Some flaws in the film (such as the casino planet Canto Bight\\, which I understood why it needed to be there it just felt kind of meh)\\, some characters felt underused and some characters seemed to appear out of nowhere (Admiral Holdo who was apparently from one of the recently released books). The action scenes were great and Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley stood out in the film. Kylo Ren (Played by Adam Driver) is a much improved character this time round as opposed to him in The Force Awakens and I can't wait to see more of him in 9. Some of the humor did feel out of place\/a bit off and I hope they tone that down a bit in 9. \\n4.5 stars out of 5.","true":true}
