Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"only reason a 2 and a half is because visually I thought it looked good. plot was poorly executed. failed to tap on some really great characters and obliterated them. Rey Finn Poe Snoke. Only character he sort of developed a bit more was Kylo but even that was ehh. He broke Yoda Leia and Luke and the whole Jedi religion. The movie wasn't terrible on it's own independent of other movies but as part of a Star Wars universe he missed the boat.","true":true}
