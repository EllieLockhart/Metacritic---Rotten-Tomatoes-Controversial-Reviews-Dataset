Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Several scenes of the movie do nothing to further the plot. The humor is at best cringe worthy. Much of the movie felt like it trying too hard to further a political agenda. Waste of time.","true":true}
