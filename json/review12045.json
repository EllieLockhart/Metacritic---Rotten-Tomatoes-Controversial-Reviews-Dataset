Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually enjoyed the movie\\, but honestly it just left such a bad taste in my mouth. So many cool things but ruining luke like this negates all the good stuff. I don't understand the need to kill off the original characters in order to make the new generation the heroes. All the books I have read about Lukes heroics\\, I so wanted to see him in true action... so disappointed but then again maybe we should just accept that Ryan Johnson is trying to give Star Wars to a new generation and just 'let the past die'. Star wars feels finished for me now.","true":true}
