Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was nothing but a bunch of fancy lights\\, good CGI and decent acting. I want to start by saying I really enjoy Star Wars movies\\, I do really. But this movie was such a disappointment as far as story goes. I would only recommend this movie to someone who wanted to see a pretty movie because it did hit that mark. But again the story was so upsetting to me...Let me explain. \\nOne of the major rules of story telling is: Never add anything to the story that doesn't progress the story forward. This is a huge rule and The Last Jedi broke that rule with Finn and Rose who go on a major adventure to find a code breaker and break their way onto Snokes ship and disable their tracking ability. However what we get instead is Rose showing Finn the corruption of the wealthy\\, abuse of animals\\, and the double dealing of arms dealers during war. They find a different weirder \\\"code breaker\\\" who then takes them aboard Snokes ship as promised and then quickly betrays them to the first order. who promptly arrest them and then lose them after a ship rips through Snokes ship. But don't worry they steal a ship and return back to their friends like nothing ever happened having not a single person other than Poe Dameron even realize that they left. 40 Minutes of movie wasted on nothing.","true":true}
