Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really loved it. I'm really not sure what the problem is\\, since I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Maybe because I came in with knowledge of Star Wars only from the movies and a bit of osmosis\\, as well as not entering any discussions prior to watching\\, but I really enjoyed it even while looking for flaws. Sure\\, there are flaws\\, but the strength of the movie trumps the flaws. I was grinning in excitement for the entire movie - I thoroughly enjoyed it\\, so I'm not sure what's all the fuss is.","true":true}
