Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good\\, some not so good.  I think there is a disconnect between fans and critics.  What critics saw was a movie\\, but fans saw some of their loved characters\\, mainly Luke\\, no longer being the Luke Skywalker of old\\, which critics are OK with\\, but not fans.  \\n\\nIn hindsight\\, it would have been better to have Leia get back to the bridge of the ship to restore power\\, move it\\, raise shields and then fade away into the Force.  Given the untimely passing away of Carrie Fisher\\, this would have fit better. When trapped on the mining planet\\, the real Luke Skywalker with the Allies from the Outer Rim rescuing the Resisitance fighters\\, leading to Luke\\, not Leia into Episode IX would have been way better.  \\n\\nStoke\\, would have been good to find out more about him.\\nThe bird was cute\\, but Chewie couldn't eat them because Disney is selling stuffies for Christmas.  \\n\\nCould have been the best Star Wars\\, but missed opportunity.","true":true}
