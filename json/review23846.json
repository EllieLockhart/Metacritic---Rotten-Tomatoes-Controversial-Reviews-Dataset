Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made look a depressed man with no hope when literally the whole movie is about having hope just destroyed his character and definitely could do with less comic relief there was definitely too much of that.","true":true}
