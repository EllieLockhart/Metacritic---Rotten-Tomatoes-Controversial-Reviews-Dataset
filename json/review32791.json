Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a pleasant viewing experience. Although not as good (in my opinion) as The Force Awakens\\, this film was still incredible in its own way. It still has this sense of nostalgia that satisfies fans of the original series\\, but also provides a new\\, fresh take on the franchise that draws in newcomers to the Star Wars universe. \\nThe film does run a little long-the drawn out heavy breathing and staring scenes could have been shortened or even cut out entirely- yet it still doesn't cover some plotholes. For example\\, what is Snoke and where did he come from? How is Rey is skilled with a lightsaber even when Luke taught her little to no combat skills?\\nPlotholes and length aside\\, The Last Jedi is a visually stunning film. The Red Throne Room fight scene is visually probably the greatest scene in the whole film. It was choreographed beautifully\\, the graphics were impeccable\\, and the whole set looked amazing.\\nAlso with this film\\, you really get to see more character development\\, especially in Kylo Ren and Rey. It does a really nice job of capturing the inner turmoil of Kylo Ren and the overall allure and appeal of the Dark Side.","true":true}
