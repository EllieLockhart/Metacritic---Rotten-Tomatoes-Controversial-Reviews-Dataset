Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Casino Planet was unnecessary and the Battle of Britain Rebel bombers made no sense in weightlessness but otherwise a great Star Wars film.","true":true}
