It's just like watching a scary '80s-'90s horror movie (very much an homage to classics such as Scream\\, Ravenous\\, Saw\\, or modern movies like The Cabin In The Woods)\\, but you control the action\\, and this \\\"movie\\\" is over 8 hours long.\r\rThe first few minutes really gets you emotionally involved in the plot\\, and while the reunion is a bit (a lot) forced\\, it works in terms of the scary movie genre that the game is paying homage to. The tension starts right away\\, and it does not let up for a moment. Even in quiet moments you're worried about what might be around the next corner. The game really gets the atmosphere right. Also\\, you care for each character\\, and while it's true that some of them are not wholly likable (in horror movie tradition\\, some are immature and they can be unkind\\, self-centered or unthinking)\\, you really feel as if you want to get them all through the horror that is about to overtake them.\r\rThe game controls are intuitive and effective\\, movement is smooth and unlike a few other games that have appeared recently\\, the characters move effortlessly from one place to another\\, without getting annoyingly caught up on furniture or architecture.\r\rThe clues and collectibles in the game are very effective\\, and the in-game menus work well to help the player assess how well or poorly the game is going. During the action sequences\\, the player needs to make split-second decisions and controller inputs\\, and in my opinion (speaking as an older but experienced gamer) these are perfectly balanced to appeal to players of most abilities.\r\rThe graphics are amazing\\, from the facial textures to the snowfall\\, lighting and shadows\\, this game really uses this latest generation of consoles to bring out detail and atmosphere. Music is very atmospheric and extremely well integrated well into the action.\r\rReplay value is wholly focused on survival\\, not on a branching plot. This is not a bad thing: while the overarching plot remains fixed\\, the fate of each character is very much decided by your actions and choices: any character or all of them can die. Conversely\\, any or all can be saved\\, but saving everyone is very hard: I only saved two of the eight characters the first time around (Sam and Emily). I'm looking forward to restarting in the hope that I can somehow get at least a few more people through \\\"until dawn\\\".\r\rThe most innovative aspect of the game is what the developers call \\\"The Butterfly Effect\\\": a build-up of small\\, seemingly insignificant changes that may have devastating consequences down the line. This feature shows itself even in the first play through\\, as an in-game menu screen tells you which decisions you've made and gives subtle hints as to how you're doing. It's not just the illusion of choice - if you mess up too often\\, people's allegiances change and their options may narrow\\, making it harder for them to survive. Sometimes\\, a small mistake will be recoverable\\, but the mistakes do mount up\\, and sometimes the choices made leave no way out. At the game's end the sun rises\\, but who will be there to see it is up to you.\r\rMy only criticisms so far (all are very minor):\r1: The camera sometimes doesn't feel as if it's showing enough of the scenes\\, and it can make movement tricky in darker areas\\, but then again\\, that may be a conscious decision because of the need for a survival horror game to be claustrophobic.\r2: The scenes with the psychiatrist take the player out of the action to some extent\\, but on the other hand\\, they do offer the player a break in what might otherwise be a very tense game\\, at least until later on\\, when even these scenes acquire some tension.\r3: There is some very minor image freezing that lasts a split second\\, usually when performing an action (I think I noticed three examples throughout the whole game).\r4: The voices are occasionally slightly out of sync with the characters' mouth movements (again\\, I noticed this maybe three times).\r5: The characters' heads seem kinda wobbly at some points (whenever it's a close-up and two or more characters are close to each other and talking). It's very subtle\\, but it is noticeable.\r6. There is no way to adjust the screen size in the game - on my TV it's still playable\\, but some items on the screen edges are clipped.\r7. I would have liked a little more humor to break the tension at some points - it's a very tense game (I think I mentioned that).\r8. The pre-order DLC is just a small inconsequential scene tacked on to the end of chapter 2. It's almost like a deleted scene in a movie and it kinda messes with the pacing. I was kind of expecting a little more.\r\rAltogether\\, I had a blast with this game\\, and I think a lot of other players will too\\, even if this type of game is not their usual fare. For me\\, this is not just one of the best survival horror games I've ever played\\, but if it were a movie\\, I'd say it would be the best horror movie since The Cabin in the Woods. Yeah\\, it's that good. I will be very surprised if this game doesn't gather a few of the most prestigious Game of the Year awards.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
