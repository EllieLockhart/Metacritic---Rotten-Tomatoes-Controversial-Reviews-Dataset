Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came to this movie with low expectations\\, but was disappointed nevertheless.  I didn't expect brilliant sci fi\\, but I was hoping for a little originality\\, a little imagination.  I guess they played it safe\\, rehashing old tropes\\, old thrills\\, set to old music.  \\n\\nThis movie has made over $100 million so far.  So it's a success as far as the Disney Corporation is concerned.  Who cares if it lacks originality or imagination\\, let alone artistic or social relevance?","true":true}
