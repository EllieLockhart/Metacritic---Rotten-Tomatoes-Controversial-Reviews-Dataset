Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, I don't know who decided Johnson should get another trilogy off the back of this but they are idiots. Just a merchandising cash grab\\, no wonder the Han Solo directors got the sack they prob wouldn't bend over and be lap dogs like Johnson was and wanted to make an actual decent Star Wars Movie!  Couldn't have been more disappointed","true":true}
