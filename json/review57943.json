Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What more can be said about this dumpster fire of a movie and then the attempt afterwards to blame the fans for the absolute mess it contained. News flash Disney\\, if people don't like your story\\, don't accuse them of being sexist white male pigs\\, because a lot of them may not be. Doesn't make me want to go and see the next film when you're vilified for justifiably criticising something. Ok so... poor parts about this film: The story for one... It was disjointed\\, incoherent\\, filled with plot holes\\, poorly scripted and filled with so many 'gotcha' moments\\, the whole film might be recategorised as a giant practical joke. From moment one where Jedi prodigy Jake Sky walker throws his father's lightsaber away to the moment where Rose Tico robs horribly castrated Finn of a half way decent character ark. This film just has to spit on everything that you could attempt to love about it. Oh and Canto Bight\\, the most pointless scene in the entirety of Star wars. Clear lazy script writing. Someone obviously thought ' I want to put an asian character in here and I already have this black guy that I have no idea how to use. I'ma have them do some pointless menial task for half the film.' I find it ironic that we who disliked the film get called racists when the only 2 characters of colour were pushed to one side through the whole film. Anyway\\, I could list more problems but my arms would fall off. Basic summary\\, don't watch this film unless you want to be angry\\, depressed and have a future that includes the headlines 'before turning the gun on himself'.","true":true}
