Don't let the people who have only read\/seen the leaks get you down. I just finished the game and I haven't really seen this edgy in-your-face agenda that everyone is complaining about. Theres gay\/bi characters for sure and 1 trans character that felt a bit pointless but doesn't detract from the overall experience.The story was done really well and let's you see the moral ambiguity that many characters have. Everyone is likable regardless of what they've done or will do. The gameplay feels like its gone through a bit of a tune up. It is still much like the first but enjoyable enough to not notice it hasn't taken the biggest leap. Infected are still a really big issue much to the chagrin of the people who said they weren't.Overall if you liked the first there is a really high chance you will like this one if you put your leak bias aside and actually play the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
