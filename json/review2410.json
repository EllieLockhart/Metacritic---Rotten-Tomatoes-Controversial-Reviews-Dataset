Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very average movie except for the effects\\, which should be experienced on a large screen. The makers are trying hard to carry on the franchise with new characters\\, most of whom are quite annoying. Among the tolerable ones\\, Daisy Ridley is quite charismatic and has a strong screen presence; probably the only saving grace of the movie. With all due respect\\, the late Carrie Fisher carries a dead-pan-face throughout the movie; no expressions at all. However\\, the makers of the movie should get some credit for having brought to the audiences good quality\\, family entertainment amid a lot of garbage out there.","true":true}
