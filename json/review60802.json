Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Before I submit this review I wanna make it clear that my displeasure with this game has nothing to do with having a female lead\\, or any sorta lgbt representation. (So don\u2019t pull the bigot card). Joel\u2019s death was handled piss poorly\\, I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with Joel being killed if it was done differently\\, it\u2019s amazing to think that in the 1st game Joel has evaded many of the infected\\, impaled on a metal rod\\, has always been discreet and untrusting of others\\, only to trust a group of randoms with loaded guns in a locked room\\, and gets golfed to death in the sequel. Abby was not a well executed character IMO\\, I felt like Abby should\u2019ve never been included in TLOU2. I wanted this game to be more focused on the already established relationship between Joel and Ellie and add more to it. It\u2019s hard to have any care for Abby when she brutally kills Joel\\, kills Jesse\\, shoots Tommy in the face\\, and beats on Ellie and Dina. And while we\u2019re forced to play as this spec ops gorilla brutalizing our favorite characters (Specifically Joel & Ellie)\\, ND somehow expects us to feel some kinda connection for her? Overall I\u2019m very disappointed with this game\\, the ending was extremely lackluster and nothing was accomplished. This game is basically the equivalent of being held at gun point and forced to throw a basket of puppy\u2019s off a **** cliff and then tell you 6 hours later how wrong you were for that act.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
