Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, I was expecting a terrible movie because of these terrible reviews. It was actually pretty good. A little boring in the beginning but got much better towards the end! I'm not even a fan of Star Wars but this one wasn't bad - better than The Force Awakens in my opinion.","true":true}
