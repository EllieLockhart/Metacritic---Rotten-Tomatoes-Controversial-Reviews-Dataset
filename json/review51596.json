Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actual human being here -\u00a0I've seen The Last Jedi three times and plan to see it several more. I first saw Empire during its run\\, as a child\\, and this film not only recaptured that magic but elevated beyond my expectations. Chances are you've already read up on the narrative\\, scenes\\, details\\, and hopefully haven't been spoiled on surprises. I found this film to be thrilling\\, beautiful\\, funny\\, intimate\\, spectacular\\, dramatic\\, challenging\\, philosophical\\, and subversive... one of the best movies in the SW series. I reveled in Rian Johnson's lush visual style and rapt attention to the characters' innermost feelings and struggles. I cheered out loud several times and have recommended this film to everyone I know\\, including non-SW fans. \\n\\nDon't believe the hate. You owe it to yourself to make your own decision. Have your own experience with the film.","true":true}
