Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think a star wars movie could be worse than The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. Well\\, congratulations\\, Disney\\, you kicked the bottom out of the way and kept going! This movie was so utterly dumb for so many reasons:\\n1) a bloated running time\\,\\n2) a completely useless casino plot that only served to introduce some useless new characters (one of which had a really stupid stutter for....no reason)\\,\\n3) misplaced humor that didn't fit the scenes or the star wars universe\\n4) awful treatment of Luke's character\\n5) preachy - Star Wars was never preachy. Often it portrayed a morally ambiguous universe where Jedis turned a blind eye to slavery and mistreatment of others. Now we have a Star Wars that talks about arms dealers that sell to both the republic and the resistance\\, and child slavery\\, and....sigh....\\n5) 'space bombers' that rely on gravity...now\\, I know star wars takes many liberties with physics\\, but this took it way too far.\\n6) space cannons that 'lob' shots in an arc...another new low for star wars physics (see #5)\\nI could keep going for a while\\, but I'm tired of this moving and have decided to forget it as much as possible so that I may reclaim and use them for more useful purposes like remembering the birthdays of all the von Trapp children.","true":true}
