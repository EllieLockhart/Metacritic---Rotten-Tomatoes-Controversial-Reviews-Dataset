This is the first time I've ever given a game an official rating because I feel very strongly about this. I give the game a 5 because I feel the game does not deserve a 0 nor does it deserve a 10. Amazing gameplay and voice actors did such an amazing job with their characters. However\\, I couldn't help but feel so miserable playing through this story as I felt forced to feel a certain way about characters as the writers wanted. An example of this is the section with the dog that the player is forced to kill\\, then forced to fall in love with this dog and feel guilty for something I did not want to play through. I continued to play\\, hoping there would be a bone thrown for me having to endure this tragic tale but nothing of that sort ever happened. As sad as it is for me to say\\, I will not look forward to any game from Naughty Dog that involves the writers associated with this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
