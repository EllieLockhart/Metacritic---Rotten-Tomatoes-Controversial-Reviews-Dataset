Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is fantastic! I think the reason people hated it is because it wasn't a nostalgia filled entry\\, but I think that makes it even better. It is a strong story matched with developed characters and a great score and scenery. It broke the mold of every other Star Wars movie\\, and the movie is all the better for it (unfortunately that's why fans didn't like it)","true":true}
