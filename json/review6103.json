{"101487":116227,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney and rian johnson ruin star wars to all real fans of THE original trilogy.. here are several points that proves they ruin this saga with TLJ. \\n\\n1) The Death of Luke. What is the point for Luke to die? Just for winning some time for the rest so they can scape? Or because fucking Disney\\, with their fucking changing director issues doesn't have a fucking idea of how doing a good development in Luke storyline? Why he die? He run out of \\\"force\\\" and die? WTF. He was not ill\\, or too old. Cause of death? cuz Disney want too kill all \\\"the old\\\" and create a fucking \\\"new\\\" shit for kids\\, that is why. Just like when they killed Han Solo in the most stupid way in TFA.\\n\\n2) Luke's legacy & behavior. No sense that if he want to die in that island he leave a map inside R2D2 so The Resistance can find him if they need it. And now Luke is a coward\\, selfish and asshole person. Why? How he became the opposite of we know and love? I can undestand that he don't want to train any other aprentice\\, for the shit that happens with Kylo. But go to an island for safe keeping Jedi treasures (that he don't litteraly give a fuck) and drink cum of an alien cow? Really? \\n\\n3) The Death of Snoke. So Snoke\\, the most badass dark side force user alive in this trilogy\\, can read mind\\, manipulate and bind telepathically two force user. But he can't sense fucking Kylo using the force to move the ligh-saber just next to him? And the rest of the Red Imperial Guard just stand there and act like they don't even have eyes to see the fucking ligth-saber moving? That is so retarded. \\nIn TFA they introduce a misterious supervillain of which we don't know shit. Who he is? where he came from? how he became so powerfull? how he founded The New Order? etc etc but now they fucking kill him with a trick so stupidly basic that even fucking child force sensitive user can do it.\\n  \\n4) Finn & Rose's subplot. Waste of time\\, the all CGI Casino bullshit. Rose falling in love with Finn? stupid as hell\\, they don't even know each other. Is just like a fucking romantic-comedy of the '90s with Meg Ryan or some shit like that. Is just there to add innecesary minutes to the movie and for the girls that like romantic shits.\\n\\n5) Rey's Parents are Nobody? WTF. There is no way that is true\\, she is so OP using the force. And besides in TFA when she touch Luke's ligth-saber she have all that family feeling from past things\\, she can hear and sense Luke\\, Obi Wan and Anakin (even Yoda). Plus she also have several identical tougths\\, expressions\\, hobbys\\, habilities and feeling like Han Solo or Anakin. There is no way she is not related with any of them. And after all Stars Wars was always about the force power in the Skywaker family blood. \\n\\n6) Death & Return of Leia. This was so ridiculious that i wasn't know if to cry or laugth in the cinema. I mean\\, she always has being force sensitive\\, she can communicate telepathically with Luke\\, becuase they are twins and they have the force. But c'mon\\, now (out of nowhere) she can\\, whitout a single lesson of using the force\\, became inmmune to fucking radiation\\, lack of oxigen and a temperature of -270\u00b0C in space? and fly like fucking Superman? That was so stupid and disrespecfull with the actress that pass away. Leia deserved to gone like a true heroin crashing her ship into First Order fleet. But NO\\, instead of just letting her have a decent ending in that movie they create the stupid Vice Admiral Holdo character for only that pourpose\\, a fucking new character that dies few minutes later and that i don't give a fuck. \\n\\n7) Humor & Tone Issues. Too many childish pranks\\, jokes\\, etc. Too many! This is a Star Wars MOVIE for fuck sake\\, not a fucking kid's movie. They transform all this beatifull history\\, characters\\, mitology in a fucking kid's show\\, because only kids can enjoy ALL those stupids force jokes (or adults with a child mind). So retarded!\\n\\n8) Dropped TFA subplots\\, like all of them: Kylo Ren & Vader relationship\\, Knights of Ren\\, etc\\, etc.\\n\\n9) Plot holes\\, lot of them. It's too obvious that when JJ Abrams writed and directed TFA there was in his mind another plan this new trilogy. But fucking Disney piss in that\\, and change the director. They put a new director that doesn't fucking have clue about Star Wars (or the courtesy and professionalism to ask) what JJ Abrams wanted to do with this trilogy. You know\\, so it makes fucking sense when u finnaly watched the 3 of them. But no\\, they piss and shit in common sense\\, the made shit up that don't fucking have any sense and fucking ruin this saga for all the true fans of the original trilogy.\\n\\n10) Why didn't Kylo notice Luke projection? He is a trained and avanced force user\\, so powerfull to trick and kill Snoke. But he can't sense a force projection? He can't see that there is something wrong with Luke being inmune to all plasma\/blasters shots? Or that Luke is avoiding phisical contact? Or that Luke is not leaving any footprints in that red salt floor? etc. etc. Fuck u movie\\, fuck u Disney.\\n\\n11) Rey's perfect light-saber techniques with no training. Adding this to the point 6\\, it doesn't have sense at all\\, and is stupid like shit. You can be the most powerfull force user\\, but if u don't get training u can't wield and much less figth with a light-saber like she does.  \\n\\n12) Yoda looks too weird!!!! And now force ghosts can control weather? They can actually inflict their will in our physical world? When that happened or where is explanation in any Star Wars movie?\\n\\nAnd after all this\\, im sure i forget some reason why i leave the cinema with that bad feeling in my heart that Disney ruins one of my fav movie saga ever","true":true}
