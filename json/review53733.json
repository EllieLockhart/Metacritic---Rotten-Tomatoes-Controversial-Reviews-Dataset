Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Movie and a worthy sequel. Who are these people who think it's worse than Episode 1? Notwithstanding a couple of things that could legitimately irritate hardcore scifi fans (bombs dropping in space\\, the slow chase in an FTL universe) this is fiction and great fun. Good humoured too.","true":true}
