Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"None of the main 'characters' have an consistent behavior instead just ranging from incompetent to perfect master of everything. Lazy story telling and the plot doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Poor depictions of the older Star Wars characters. This movie is an overall disappointment and failure.","true":true}
