Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love the movie but can't.\\n\\nDirector seemed more concerned with eliminating legacy characters themes and story lines than creating a great movie.  Blatant disregard for off plot lines from Force Awakens made it very obvious that movie had different director.  Slap in the face to Star Wars fans.\\n\\nMovie has too many plot holes\\, convenience happenings and flaws in \\nlogic.\\n\\nCasting of Kylo Rhen is horrible every other movie he plays a stoner surfer dude\\, keep the mask on.","true":true}
