The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's very easy to get on your high horse and believe that your creation is too sophisticated for \\\"people to get\\\". That will make some people compelled to \\\"get it\\\"\\, so they can feel brighter\\, or more open-minded than others. But there's nothing to \\\"get\\\". This game overstays its welcome by 15-20 hours. It's repetitive and extremely boring\\, trying so hard to shock you with one of the worst excuses for a story I have ever experienced in gaming. The sudden flashes of storytelling brilliance (the astronaut scene) only hold contrast to the bleak everything else. The devs have completely abandoned everything that made the first game the masterpiece that it was and filled this game with a lot of SJW stuff\\, for the sake of being edgy. Unmemorable\\, and even completely insufferable characters that you are forced to spend time with\\, and Ellie can easily make this list\\, too (I disliked her character arc just as much as I disliked Abby). By the end of this unfortunate 30 hours experience\\, I couldn't care less who dies and in which order. It is hard to believe that such a flop could possibly exist when you have unlimited resources\\, and top-notch talent on all frontlines of visuals\\, music\\, level design\\, and voice actors. But those things are never enough if there's no compelling story to tell\\, and I feel extremely sorry for the people that were overworked to create this game. You can put 10.000 plants and detail every piece of grime on a wall by hand\\, but that's not why we play games. And elementary school philosophy doesn't count as a compelling story. I regret every second I have spent in the second part of this game. I am extremely disappointed to say that. I will never buy another Naughty Dog title\\, as long as the current leaders stay in their place.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
