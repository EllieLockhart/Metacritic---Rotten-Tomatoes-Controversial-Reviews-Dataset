Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good action but the story makes no sense what so ever...  I feel like the director has never even seen a star wars movie in his life....  Luke  becomes a failure wussy\\, Leia and Rey becomes a god tier force user with no training what so ever\\, and Finn doesn't grow at all as a character just stays the scared deserter he was in the first film...  Just felt like such a waist of good characters.","true":true}
