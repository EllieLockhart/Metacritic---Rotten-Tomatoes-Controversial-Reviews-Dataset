Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know\\, to some\\, that the movie isn't considered as part of the canon\\, but 8 of us went to see The Last Jedi and after wards\\, we not only gave it two thumbs up\\, but went back to see it again. It was that GOOD!","true":true}
