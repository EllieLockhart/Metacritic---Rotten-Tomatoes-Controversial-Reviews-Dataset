Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hoping for this to be the flawless Star Wars movie I've been waiting for. I was hoping for an utterly perfect\\, beautiful movie that I can't find one flaw in. I did not get that movie\\, but it was dang close.\\nOne of the things that was best about this movie was the cinematography. Rian Johnson's beautiful directing really shines in this movie\\, and it brings for some stunning moments. For a movie like this\\, there has to be something to truly bring you into the world of what's going on\\, and the visuals here do it. The performances here are also great. Mark Hamill's character kind of feels like a damaged old man here\\, and his facial expressions really do it here. I think it was his best Star Wars performance yet. Adam Driver was also fantastic in this movie\\, as well as lots of the supporting cast. It also featured really well choreographed action scenes. Porgs also didn't pull a Baby Groot and weren't annoying in this movie\\, even if they might just be there to sell toys.\\nThere were some minor flaws\\, which is upsetting because I really wanted this to be a perfect Star Wars movie. There was a stupid \\\"subplot\\\" that I won't go into detail about\\, but it drags the story and was a stupid choice featuring bland scenes. It's a minor thing\\, but it would be a lot more enjoyable if it wasn't there. There's also some questionable choices that could have been avoided if this trilogy had one director. It feels like Rian Johnson is trying to undo everything J.J. Abrhams did\\, and then J.J. Abhrams will try to undo what Johnson did in this one\\, and it would have ended up a clearer path if this trilogy had one director.\\nOverall\\, the Last Jedi did everything a second movie in a trilogy needed to do. The cinematography and visuals were great\\, the characters and actors were fantastic\\, and the action scenes worked well. It suffered however from minor plot details that could have been cleaned up easily. It wasn't a perfect movie\\, but it's worth checking out for sure.","true":true}
