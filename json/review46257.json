Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was a disgrace to Star Wars\\, disregarded all fan speculation. This film catered to the people that claim to be Star Wars fans and really know nothing about it. For the true fans who have immersed themselves in the Star Wars universe\\, this film will be a cheap rip off of everything they've come to love","true":true}
