Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched the movie twice. Lurked was done so dirty in this move. Snoke was so badass but killed so stupidly. Story was nothing but plot holes. The movie is a must see but I think this is the worst Star Wars movie. Leia should have been killed on this move because she is dead in real life. Now all we have are these new characters because the main characters in Star Wars are dead. Why can everyone use the force now with no training?? But bottome line LUKE SHOULD NOT BE DEAD BUT HE IS","true":true}
