The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is a masterpiece\\, and I don't have words to express my feelings about the entire experience I've during the story. Half of the community hated the game only because of Joel's death\\, forgetting about the cruel word they live and ANY character can possibly die from many ways. Besides that\\, the game itself is dark and I understand the feeling of \\\"It should not be ended in this way\\\"\\, but there's no way to bring Joel back\\, making the decision of revenge a stupid action\\, since Abby is trying to redeem herself by saving Lev\\, being stopped by the tenacity of Ellie when she remember about Joel. Nobody is a \\\"hero\\\" in this world\\, you need to pay attention to all the details in this game to understand this. For example: All NPCs have names and their friends and allies have interaction with their deaths; You can see the peaceful vision that Abby have about this world\\, turning against the Wolves and saving two Scars from their death. She don't want to be part of a meaningless genocide of people that are trying to survive against the Infected. The conflict between Wolves and Scars only resulted in several deaths of innocents\\, like the chase of Ellie to kill Abby\\, killing a pregnant woman and his boyfriend. To understand the feeling of the game\\, you need to feel empathy for Abby\\, because her dad was killed by Joel\\, making him the villain of HER story. We interact with two stories at same time\\, and no one wins in the ending\\, making Ellie alone. The LGBT details in the map are kinda random\\, but it doesn't matter to the story after all\\, and the part o Lev being a trans man to avoid the situation of many womans in their tribe is very impactful\\, showing hope for kindness and love aside hate and death towards their people.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
