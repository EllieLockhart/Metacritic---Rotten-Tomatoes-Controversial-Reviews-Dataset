Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was surprisingly easy to follow in spite of what I'd heard about Star Wars. There are these good guys in small spaceships being chased by bad guys in big spaceships. The good guys have to sneak in to one of the big ships to turn off some sort of tracker. This girl warrior learns how to do magic tricks from a grumpy old wizard who vanishes at the end after tricking the main bad guy. The good guys escape and share some rotisserie chicken.","true":true}
