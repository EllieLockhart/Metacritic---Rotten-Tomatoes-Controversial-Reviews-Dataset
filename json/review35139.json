Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The forced progressive undertones and man shaming in this made this movie  terrible .... lack of new droids and not following the right characters story's ruined this movie. Stop trying to make something of nothing .... looking like the movie was written by a feminist.","true":true}
