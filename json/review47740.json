Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When we last saw Luke Skywalker\\,\\, he was a swashbuckling hero of the cause. Here\\, he is a regretful simp\\, who doesn\u2019t want to get involved for reasons that just aren\u2019t true to his character. Or\\, at least\\, his character in this movie is not the Luke Skywalker that audiences want to see. And when he does finally pick up the light saber\\, sort of\\, it\u2019s too little too late and ultimately too silly.","true":true}
