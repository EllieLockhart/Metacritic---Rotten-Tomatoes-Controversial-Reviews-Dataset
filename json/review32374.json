{"101487":169898,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-14","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead. Disney holds the knife.\\n\\nI'd give this movie a lower rating\\, if one existed.\\n\\nI'm a Star Wars fan\\, and have been for years. This film was a deliberate kick in the face to people like myself. Worse\\, it was a shovel full of shit to the face. Never have I felt so disrespected before in film history.\\n\\nHere's a question that I want answered: Why the f*** would I ever watch a Star Wars move after this one again? There is nothing left\\, no story thread worth pursuing. Anything that was interesting from this universe has been erased. Every character that made Star Wars iconic has been killed\\, and in a very unsatisfactory manner. \\n\\nThis film goes out of it's way to insult the viewer. Maybe the prequels weren't going to win any Oscars\\, but at least I didn't feel like George Lucas wanted to punch me in the face\\, or that he despised me and wanted me to suffer. They are masterpieces in comparison to this garbage. \\n\\nThe writers of this film obviously have a deep\\, bitter\\, seething resentment. They take it out on the fanbase (no surprise as to them probably 80% of Star Wars fans are old school straight males). Superfeminist Kathleen Kennedy and gay man Rian Johnson have a vendetta against the viewer\\, and they really go out of their way to make us suffer\\, probably for the crime of being born.\\n\\nLet me say I don't give a damn about politics. I'm a liberal\\, I believe in letting anyone do whatever the hell they want\\, as long as they don't bother me. I wish films could be free of political agendas but sadly this is becoming less and less common in our world.\\n\\nThe creators sacrificed good storytelling in lieu of pushing an agenda. The story is pathetic\\, badly told\\, full of plotholes and pointless. It has no beginning\\, middle or end. They do not even mildly follow the story of TFA. It's like a reboot of a reboot\\, no continuity whatsoever. There is a casino planet full of evil white people (I challenge you to find any \\\"diversity\\\" amongst the tuxedo-wearing\\, stuck up \\, wealthy patrons)\\, an asian chick that has no point in existing. Even Finn's character was butchered\\, reverting into the coward he was in the beginning of TFA.\\n\\nBut the biggest coward of all is Luke Skywalker. Things got rough so he fled the known galaxy\\, spending his days cut off from the force\\, doing practically nothing and milking the tits of a purposefully disgusting\\, revolting\\, alien just to survive. Luke\\, who defeated Vader and was a hero of the rebellion\\, who stood unarmed before the emperor with no fear\\, left his sister alone to fight against evil. Even when he found out his best friend Han Solo\\, (who on several occasions saved Luke's life)\\, was killed\\, he just cries and whines some more\\, and remains unmoved. \\n\\nOur childhood hero\\, the eternal optimist and the bravest soul in the galaxy\\, was absolutely and completely butchered. Quoting Mark Hamill\\, \\\"This is not Luke anymore. Maybe it's Jake Skywalker\\, but he's not my Luke Skywalker.\\\" He was purposefully humiliated\\, and his character destroyed.\\n\\nI will never watch a movie from these filmakers ever again. If someone enters your house\\, smashes your toys and shits on your rug\\, that is not \\\"being bold\\\"; that is insulting. You never invite that person over again.\\n\\nThese movies are statement pieces\\, nothing more. They are meant to deconstruct cultural icons\\, trash them\\, and replace them with concepts of \\\"diversity\\\"\\, and \\\"feminism\\\". They destroy Luke because he symbolizes classic heroism\\,and knighthood\\, embodied in a simple man. Cultural Marxists abhore tradition\\, traditional mythology\\, and traditional ideals. Destroy the world\\, and rebuild it into what you want it to be. They clearly state for you exactly what they want to do with this franchise; let the past die... kill it if you have to.?\\n\\nAvoid at all costs. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
