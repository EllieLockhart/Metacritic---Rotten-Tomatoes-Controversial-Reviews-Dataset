Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not all bad. It's only mostly bad. The Last Jedi has some good scenes and moments (2 stars worth). The plot didn't really make sense at all. The political messaging was really overbearing. The story that was started in The Force Awakens was basically gutting or ignored. The main protagonist is a hollow mary sue. I loved Rey as a character\\, she had so much potential. They really failed to develop her character in this movie. The plot and story are illogical and unsatisfying. There was one joke that managed to elicit a laugh; the rest didn't work in the context of the scenes. Serious scenes just had their gravitas sapped by a tone dead joke. The acting was good\\, and helped a bit in many scenes where the writing and story were just not working. There are a few scenes which from a purely audio visual perspective are probably the best scenes ever filmed in a star wars movie. Watch it when it comes to streaming\\, don't waste valuable time\/money going to a movie theatre for a 2 star flick.","true":true}
