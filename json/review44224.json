Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too jokey\\, too much plot armor...you know everyones going to be just fine....doesnt have the gravity of the original trilogy. Luke's story is saddening\\, Leia's abilities jump the shark...expectations werent met. Disney add's way too much polish and flare to these new SW movies...its so brazenly about making money that the story suffers. The original trilogy had some grit (i.e. Han\\, Lando\\, etc.) and most definitely didnt try to force inject humor just to make some laughs...Im not saying JJ and Rian's humor are Jar Jar-level\\, but they don't add to the story\\, they take away from it. The original trilogy was fun and amazing without the need to constantly promise and reassure the audience that they'll have a good time. Lastly\\, the whole Rose\/Animal Cruelty\/Lets talk about hope and justice every 2 minutes is really annoying...we dont need a rated R Star Wars (although...) but we certainly dont need to be told repeatedly the naive reasons we should rescue dog\/horse mammals and fight for love not hate\\, blah blah blah. That was just stupid. That was Rian's ewok moment.","true":true}
