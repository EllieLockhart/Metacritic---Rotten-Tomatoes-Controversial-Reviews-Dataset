Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is nothing like the first game which can be referred to as a masterpiece and will probably remain in the top 10 best RPG's for a long time to come.

However Part II\\, despite having slightly better graphics than the previous game sucked in every other aspect. It seemed as though they just wanted to push some kind of SJW story\\, while trying to also add some artistic value\\, but in the end it was just an atrocious attempt. Think of your worst B movie\\, then multiply that by 10. It really makes me wonder how the so called \\\"critics who get paid' for a living to give honest reviews\\, gave this monstrosity a perfect 10. If you haven't purchased this game as yet\\, then I recommend that you do not waste your money buying it. I would recommend you borrow this from somebody first and confirm for yourself  before deciding if you will enjoy this game. I am willing to bet that 9 times out of 10\\, you will agree with my user review. If you want play-ability and good story telling then I would recommend either getting Ghost of Tsushima or waiting for CyberPunk 2077. Please note that I am just a stranger who has been playing many games since the early 80s and has nothing to gain by being dishonest. I have never reviewed anything before but felt passionately about this specific one\\, as I could not sit back any longer and allow the makers of this game lie to everyone anymore. Please take what I have said above seriously to avoid disappointment. Sincerely\\, Not wasting any more time here.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
