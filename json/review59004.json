While I did enjoy the gameplay slightly more\\, it still felt like it was plagued by the problems of the first game: Bad AI\\, very repetitive stealth sections\\, too much QTE\\, skill tree system that doesn't do anything\\, and a couple other things. They did add some new things too\\, like unpreventable jump scares and some slightly annoying attempts to make it seem less linear. The pacing of the gameplay clearly saw some improvements thankfully\\, making it easier to progress. Characters were very hit or miss\\, and some of the acting felt weak. Where to start on the story. The pacing was god awful\\, I actively hated playing through a large portion of the game although I enjoyed the it mostly until around mid way through. The story tries to make you feel bad through cheap tricks\\, that are easy to see through. I understand the themes and ideas of revenge and violence that they were trying explore\\, but they did it in cheap ineffective\\, sometimes clearly emotionally manipulative ways. I wouldn't buy it\\, unless you don't care about the story all that much and enjoyed the gameplay of the first game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
