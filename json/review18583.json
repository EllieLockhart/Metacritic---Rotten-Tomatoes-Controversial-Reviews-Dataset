Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":".It looked great\\, but the film made me question if I ever really liked the franchise in the first place. I know it won't happen\\, but I wish it would be decannonized. As it currently stands\\, I won't be hurrying back to another Star Wars film under Disney's watch.","true":true}
