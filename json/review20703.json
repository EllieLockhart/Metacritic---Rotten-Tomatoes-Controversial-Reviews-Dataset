Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I waited until I saw it for the third time before giving it a rating.  I love this movie.  Great story with plenty of action.  It is also the most emotional Star Wars movie ever.  The only reason why I give it 4.5 instead of 5 is that it feels fairly disconnected from the greater Star Wars canon (very few links to all of the book\\, TV shows\\, etc.).","true":true}
