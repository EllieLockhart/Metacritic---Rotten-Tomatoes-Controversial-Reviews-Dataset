Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Messy and unfocused. Basically\\, the same criticism that has been voiced by many others. Disappointing \\\"reveals\\,\\\" time-wasting red herrings\\, weirdly misplaced humor\\, nonsensical plot holes\\, some real eye-roll inducing dialogue about war versus love\\, underdeveloped characters\\, excessive prequel-style CGI silliness\\, etc. Very little of the joy and spunk we saw in the Force Awakens (yes\\, it was a corporate-driven soft reboot of the franchise. Abrams was open that. Difference here is that Abrams did it with a wink and a grin. He made sure it was *fun* which we clearly appreciated as an audience). Some breathtaking visuals and beautiful set pieces in Last Jedi. Johnson is a gifted director. But the story he tried to tell is a clunky\\, rambling and mostly joyless rehash of stuff from earlier Star Wars installments. Didn't *hate* it\\, but I certainly didn't love it. Just ... well. Let's put it this way: I saw it once and that number isn't going to change.","true":true}
