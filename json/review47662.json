Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When your movie comes out on DVD and bluray and you literally have to GIVE away a book that explains all the plotholes and things that dont make sense in the actual movie what more needs saying?","true":true}
