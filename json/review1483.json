Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a hardcore Star wars fan that has read much of the Legends as well as new Canon books\\, played games such as KOTOR 1 & 2\\, frequently reads the comics from the franchise\\, I absolutely loved this movie. I will immediately state that\\, yes\\, this isn't the best one from all the movies and it has a few flaws\\, but despite that I'd rate it a solid 8.5\/10. The movie gets the Star Wars feeling right but also is unique in the sense that it's unlike any of the other movies. And that is a good thing! The Last Jedi took risks and in my opinion they paid off!","true":true}
