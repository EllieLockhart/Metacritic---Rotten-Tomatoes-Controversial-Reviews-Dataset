Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a Star Wars movie.  Thanks Disney and Rian Johnson for ruining an awesome franchise.. Making a childhood fantasy hero a crotchety old loser and nothing like what we watched\\, read and grew up with. If you like spaceships and explosions\\, you'll like it.  If you are a star wars geek\\, you'll walk out very disappointed.","true":true}
