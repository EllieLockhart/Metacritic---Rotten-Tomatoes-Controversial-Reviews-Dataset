Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so many many plot holes\\, unnecessary added characters\\, story seems to be going nowhere. after the brilliance that was a new hope\\, this movie will go down in history as the one where the producers threw money at an incapable director and story writer instead of taking something from the lore of the legend that is star wars.","true":true}
