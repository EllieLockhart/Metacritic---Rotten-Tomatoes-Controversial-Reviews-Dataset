Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very underwhelming star wars movie. Highlights are the performance of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fischer. Feels less like a Star Wars movie and more like a run of the mill Harry Potter or adapted adventure film based on a young adult novel like the Hunger Games or Twilight.","true":true}
