{"101487":149699,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me begin by saying I normally don't bother with doing movie reviews. In fact\\, this would be my first one on this site. But quite frankly\\, the amount of low reviews for this movie from so-called \\\"fans\\\" is inexcusable.\\n\\nI have a strong feeling those who were disappointed went into the movie with a preconstructed script in their heads and a belief that they knew what to expect. I can say with certainty that this movie WILL subvert your expectations\\, and if you can't accept that\\, then you probably shouldn't bother seeing it if you're going to judge it that harshly.\\n\\nIf you can accept it\\, though\\, The Last Jedi is one of the best efforts to push forward the Star Wars saga to date\\, and the direction it takes is refreshingly different. It's not just good from the view of the saga as a whole either\\, it's great as its own movie as well.\\n\\nBefore I'm accused of being a fanboy that can't see when something has problems\\, I do have a few complaints\\, as well as some comments that didn't bother me\\, but I could see as reasonable complaints from someone else. The beginning could use some improvement\\, I was actually feeling a little concerned for no more than the first 30 minutes. There were a lot of humorous moments\\, which I didn't mind\\, as I felt it balanced out the VERY serious moments this movie has\\, but I could see why they could be considered out of place. The porgs may be a little too prevalent for some. Again\\, I didn't mind\\, but one of my friends that was with me loved the movie despite the porgs rather than because of them. Other than that\\, there are a couple more things I found slightly questionable\\, but I can't find a good way to elaborate on them without delving into spoilers\\, so let's just say that I very much acknowledge that this is not a \\\"perfect\\\" movie.\\n\\nOverall\\, the worst I could possibly give The Last Jedi is 4 1\/2\\, maybe 4 stars\\, but it earns a 5 from me to counter the completely unfair 1\/2-1 1\/2 star reviews flooding the site right now.","true":true}
