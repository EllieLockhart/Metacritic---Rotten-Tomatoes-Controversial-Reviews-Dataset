Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is an utter disgrace to the franchise. A true Star Wars fan will fully understand the wave of disappointment. Many other reviews have covered all the details. Basically Rian Johnson went out of his way to undo any and all the good J. J. Abrams tried to offer in TFA. To Rian's success he did exactly that\\, completely gave an exit strategy for the Star Wars fandom.","true":true}
