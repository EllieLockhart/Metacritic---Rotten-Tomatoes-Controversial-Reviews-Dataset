Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a let down this movie was! Far too much humour for the \\\"darkest film yet.\\\" Cinematically this film is beautiful however\\, this does not feel like a Star Wars film at all with it been poorly written. Disney refuse to mention any of the other films with no mention of big characters in previous movies. The main characters in this film have no back story whatsoever. Snoke and Rey are brilliant characters with terrible backgrounds. Questions that fans have been waiting to find out the answers for have not been answered. Luke who is meant to be debatably the best character is the franchises is a massive let down who doesn't care at all. After 40 years for a return to Star Wars Mark Hammil was killed off the shittiest way possible. Carrie Fisher will now by the looks of things will be in the next movie (which also makes no sense)","true":true}
