Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good\\, Kyle Ren character has depth\\, he and Rey have chemistry. BB8 provided comic relief. The bad\\, Leia in space? Not enough Jedi action\\, pathetic Jedi training\\, Yoda was out of place & the ending was trash. I was stunned when the credits started\\, I thought I missed something. This would\u2019ve been a good offshoot movie. Worse then Phantom Menace ","true":true}
