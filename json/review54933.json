Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its pretty obvious they made a social propaganda checklist and then wrote the movie to fit all the action items on their list. I like female lead movies but this was openly blatant at the sacrifice of story and canon. Things like Ackbar dying when he could have filled the role of the purple hair bitch shows even aliens who are male must go. Every female was a heroic savior while every male was a either a fool or evil. Even the pointless subplot of Finn and Rose was added to talk about evil rich people and mistreating animals to the point they had to free the animals as their Alliance friends were on the verge of death (apparently freeing the slave children wasnt as important) only to have Poe be a failure again with his mutiny and give Holdo the chance to be the real hero. On and on through the entire movie. The agenda was far more important than the movie. I sadly have to add I am for equal rights for all people\\, I attempt to be thoughtful and courteous to everyone I meet so this is not something I see in every aspect of life.?","true":true}
