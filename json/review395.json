I have to get that game!\\\" But at the time I was aiming for the release of other titles that interested me more\\, until this Christmas when I saw a good deal and I decided to buy it.\r\rI'm not a huge fan of these games\\, my girlfriend enjoys them much more than I do\\, but it is certainly a great game\\, I think it'll have a place at the horror games genre for a long time.\r\rThe graphics are spectacular\\, the characters facial expressions fascinate me\\, the environment is also incredibly terrifying: A snow storm in a dark and spooky mountain in the middle of nowhere with all sorts of horrors: mutilated animals\\, monsters\\, murderers\\, ghosts\\, legends about supernatural things\\, a really badass asylum\\, abandoned mines ... And scares around every corner! I can still remember me and my girlfriend playing around 2AM when suddenly a freaking black wolf appears out of nowhere at the asylum\\, God we shouted out loud... We looked at eachother and we started laughing and  looking everywhere for if there was a wolf in our living room\\, hahahaha! Our neighbor didn't find it that funny and started banging on the wall! And playing Emily in the mines... Goodness gracious... Can't you already shut the hell up blody Wendigo? Hahahaha!!\r\rAs for the story\\, I love games where your actions affect the course of the game's story\\, in Until Dawn they have captured that and have taken it to the extreme\\, having the possibility to kill all characters for the slightest judgment or decision that doesn't even seem that important\\, and just to remind you they tell you what you did wrong\\, like: \\\"It's your fault he's dead!\\\" :\\,( They have done a great job and have taken care of every detail\\, you discover the history of the mountain and all the horrific events that occurred there bit by bit.\r\rThere was only one thing I don't really get to understand\\, and it's Dr. Allan's role\\, Joshes psychiatrist. At the beginning I can clearly see that all those questions he asks you about your biggest fears and all that stuff is what go seeing along the adventure\\, but when you reach certain point in the story... Well\\, it lost its meaning and his purpose is not very clear. Yes\\, we get that he's an hallucination and that Josh is crazy\\, so what?\r\rNevertheless\\, I've had a blast both times I played with my girlfriend and the next time I'll do a collect'em all trophies.\r\rDefinitely a good title to enlarge my PS4 collection :) See ya!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
