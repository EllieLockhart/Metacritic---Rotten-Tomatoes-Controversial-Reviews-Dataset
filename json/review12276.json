Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not sure how it\u2019s possible but believe me when I say this\\, but honestly I\u2019d rather watch the prequels. Worst. Star Wars. Ever.","true":true}
