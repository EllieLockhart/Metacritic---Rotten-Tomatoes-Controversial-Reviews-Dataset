Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ao mesmo tempo em que \u00e9 uma grande homenagem aos tempos da trilogia cl\u00e1ssica\\, consegue tamb\u00e9m conduzir a saga a um novo e promissor futuro. Emocionante\\, empolgante\\, divertido e surpreendente!!!! Com certeza est\u00e1 no roll dos melhores da saga!","true":false}
