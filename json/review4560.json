Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly a movie written with too many cooks in the kitchen with too many agendas they were trying to push. \\n\\nPlot holes abound\\, new characters barely developed\\, old characters changed with no plausible explanations.\\n\\nThe only goal seems to have been to subvert audience expectations regardless of whether or not the expectations were good ideas.","true":true}
