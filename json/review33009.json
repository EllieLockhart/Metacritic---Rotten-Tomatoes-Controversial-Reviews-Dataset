Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story wise\\, this movie is awful. Tries to subvert expectations\\, for the sake of the subversion\\, and not for creating a better and more engaging story. Destroys old characters that made the franchise great for the sake of being different. Full of jokes that tonally are inconsistent with the emotion that the scene is trying to achieve. Badly written\\, full of plot holes.\\nThe only thing that it is great is for the visual and vistas.\\nSo\\, if you are interested to watch a movie that requires that you just shut off your brain and just accept the beautiful scenes that the movies throws on your eyes\\, and just accept the blatant political message that it ungracefully spouts at you. That's your movie!","true":true}
