Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is simply the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I do not consider it canon and cannot even begin to comprehend why they would disrespect and sabotage the character of Luke the way they did. Awful AWFUL movie.","true":true}
