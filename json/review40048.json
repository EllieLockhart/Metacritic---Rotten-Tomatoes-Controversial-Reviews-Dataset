Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review ever on this site...and I have to say that I hate writing it.   The Last Jedi is a movie that I have wanted to see for a long time.  I sat through it\\, but at the end I left wondering what I had just watched.  After several days to let it sink in\\, I have to say I did not like this movie very much at all.  Lots of plot holes\\, but mostly because Rian Johnson just SHIT on not just the Force Awakens...but most of Start Wars aslo.  He basically took one of the best characters in Cinema with Luke Skywalker and wasted what could have been with this garbage.  I will not be going to see Episode 9 in theaters.  What would be the point?  Emo Darth Vader does nothing for me at this point.  AHHHHHGH","true":true}
