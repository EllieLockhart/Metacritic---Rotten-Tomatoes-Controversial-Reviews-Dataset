Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie is a disgRace.  Critics cozying up to Disney is the only reason for the high critics score. Rian Johnson has helmed a cinematic Titanic.  The Action is rubbish. THe story elements are scattergun. the SJW overtones are heavy handed and unwanted. Finn and Poe are turned into jokes. Leia is made a mary poppins clone\\, and what they did to Luke is nothing short of disgusting. The heart and sole of the original trilogy has been turned into a defeated angry old man. Less than a shadow of the character we all loved.  Admiral Ackbar's death was a throw away.  Of the new characters General Holdo was criminally stupid. She had no idea how to handle a simple situation.  Rose Tico was a total waste of space finally putting her own selfishness a head of the needs of the group.  To sum up this film is rubbish. It will destroy the fan base and probably sink Star Wars altogether.","true":true}
