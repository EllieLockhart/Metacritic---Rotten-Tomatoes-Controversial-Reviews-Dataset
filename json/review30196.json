Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it last night and still feel hungover. I just don\u2019t get why they trashed this film with the ending and killed off too many characters without reason. I have no idea what the franchise has in store going forward but I wouldn\u2019t want to be in JJ\u2019s shoes for anything. After all the hype\\, after all the waiting\\, I honestly felt like there was no need to ever see another star wars film again when I first walked out of the theater.","true":true}
