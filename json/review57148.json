Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not\\, Star Wars. It is a $ grab. This film\\, and TFA contradict each other\\, and unceremoniously dismiss our favorite characters\\, and story-lines that made Star Wars such a huge part of our society.\\n\\nWhere is the mysticism? Why do away with The Jedi\\, and The Sith? Why when you do  re-introduce these characters do you make them out to weaklings that have learned nothing from their past?   What was done to Yoda is this film was just so disrespectful. You turned into a cartoon character meant to be silly\\, and make people laugh. Such a big fail. No need to re-hash what has already been said about Luke\\, its all true\\, and Hamill agrees.  Disney\\, you are blowing it\\, and really angering people in the process.  \\n\\nStar Wars is about struggle in the remote and dark wastelands\\, not some CGI enhanced\\, bright universe ( JJ Abrams :p )\\, with unbelievable story lines\\, characters\\, weapons\\, and vessels that you never finish developing\\, and\/or contradict completely. \\n\\nThe existing canon is what you should be following. Its obvious your having trouble writing because you keep using the same plot lines used in the previous movies while still trying to dismiss all of that canon\\, lol! This should be obvious to you right now\\, because Rouge One\\, was great\\, we liked it. Why? Because it was a preexisting story with preexisting characters that we already love. The crew you have on board now cannot write....PERIOD!\\n\\nKylo Ren\\, is WEAK!\\n\\nI am no bot\\, nor am I a fandom crazed\\, convention attending guy. I am not part of some premeditated attack out of anger. I am just a guy that grew up on Star Wars\\, as are most of us in this world.\\n\\nPlease\\, use the existing canon\\, hire someone with a real passion for the first six stories\\, and its history\\, and culture. Find the people that wrote some of the better books that followed the first three movies\\, and get them on board. Bring George Lucas back to at least be a co-producer. GET. RID. OF. J.J. ABRAMS.\\n\\nStop trying to make Star Wars\\, a cutesy\\, laugh a minute children's story.\\n\\nStop trying to undo what Star Wars really is in order to make up a completely different universe where you have all of the control\\, and an unlimited amount of\\, we'll do whatever the hell we want to make $$$.\\n\\nYou are failing\\, and breaking hearts\\, and angering many. I will not spend any more of my money until when\\, and if you find someone who gets it\\, and is ready to do what it takes to bring back the true culture\\, history\\, and mysticism  of what is already there\\, and is loved by so many.   \\n\\nIll see you when\\, and if that ever happens.\\n\\nStop dragging the Disney name through the mud with this stuff\\, seriously.","true":true}
