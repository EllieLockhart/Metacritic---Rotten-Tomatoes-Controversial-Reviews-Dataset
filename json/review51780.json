Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fabulously complex addition to Star Wars that gets better the more you see it. Handles nostalgia the way it should be handled and also creates new and exciting opportunities for the future. Though not for everyone (as you might have noticed) it has the true\\, pure Star Wars feel to it and delivers exactly what the Saga needs.","true":true}
