Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed on all aspects of the movie. Bad humor at bad times\\, terrible plot\\, insignificant characters and scenes and most of all it went completely opposite direction from Force Awakens.  If the title didn't have Starwars in it\\, it would have not made it to the theaters.","true":true}
