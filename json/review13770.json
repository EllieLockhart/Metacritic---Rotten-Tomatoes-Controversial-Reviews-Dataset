Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found his movie EXCELLENT! The inner conflict of light and dark side resonates in many characters. From Luke\\, Rey and Kylo ren. The story required some thinking\\, and was excellent. This is much stronger that's 'the force awakens.'  I certainly do not mind flashback scenes. An excellent film for anyone.","true":true}
