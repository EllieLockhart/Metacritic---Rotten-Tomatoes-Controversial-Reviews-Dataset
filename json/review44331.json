Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes and pointless sub-plots. Threw away potential story lines set up from previous movie. Rey didn't get any training apart from \\\"breathe\\\". Luke skywalker wasted. Scatty build up. Pointless casino plot line that felt like another movie entirely. Bad writing made to look good.","true":true}
