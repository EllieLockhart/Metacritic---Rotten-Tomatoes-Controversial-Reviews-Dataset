Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you don't understand the bad reviews\\, I will explain one common reason. Many of the fans follow Mark Hamill on twitter. He's a really nice guy who's been involved in the community for 40 years. Then a guy (the director) came by without earning his star wars stripes and writes the Luke character in this movie. Mark had objections to the direction of the character but his objections were ignored (the director knows better\\, Disney knows better). \\n\\nSo imagine watching SW as a person who actually admires Luke\\, or admires Mark Hamill. In this movie\\, the new character who has done very little with the fans is beating up Mark\\, insulting him\\, calling him a attempted child murderer. This isn't what fans wanted to see of their hero. It's really upsetting.\\n\\nOnce the 'love bubble' bursts (where we overlook flaws)\\, we see the movie for what it is - the jokes are awful\\, they dump the old beloved characters like senior citizens who are too old to contribute to society\\, and so on. It just keeps adding on when Disney then calls these people names. If they had listened to Mark or given him his own starring movie\\, I think it would have made a lot of fans very happy. \\n\\nInstead a rich company bought the rights and treated the beloved characters (followed by the fans) like crap\\, and they still go onto make over a billion dollars. You know\\, Disney.","true":true}
