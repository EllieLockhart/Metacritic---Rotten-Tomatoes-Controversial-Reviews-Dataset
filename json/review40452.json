{"101487":182932,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first review I've ever written on this site\\, but I felt compelled to after how disappointed I was when I left. I definitely did not feel this is a 93% movie. A lot of my criticisms were similar to those other viewers had. (SPOILERS).\\n\\n1) Snoke was a very interesting character and for the past 2 years\\, we were left wondering who he was and where he learned his powers.  Enjoy him while he lasts\\, cause it isn't long. And no answers are given.\\n\\n2) Everyone was left speculating who Rey's parents were. Some subtle hints were left but it was all just misdirection. They were nobodies. Hope you weren't expecting much.\\n\\n3) The Empire was defeated 30 years ago. Since then\\, the Republic formed and the empire was scattered.  Somehow\\, the First Order\\, while in hiding managed to build entire fleets of enormous ships\\, recruit and train large armies\\, and design new space and ground weapons.....in that same period\\,  Rebels were reduced to 1 cruiser\\, a handful of fighters and a medical frigate to keep the peace in the galaxy.  Seriously\\, WTF have they been doing for the past 30 years....\\n\\n4)  Rey is essentially a Force master with almost no training.  It didn't seem like she did any real training with Luke. She \\\"reached out\\\" once and that was pretty much the extent of her training. She didn't ask a lot of questions\\, just did a little soul searching and chopped a rock in half.\\n\\n5) Thanks for stopping by Luke\\, later!  He stuck around to say a couple interesting things but really didn't do much else until the last few minutes.\\n\\n6)  Benicio Del Toro was very interesting and charismatic...so naturally he had a whole 10 minutes of screen time.  \\n\\n7) We get it Disney\/Star Wars\\, women are strong too.  But the overcompensating in this movie is becoming increasingly distracting.  There was an audible cringe in the theater when the new\\, brave Admiral Purple Hair was introduced....\\n\\n8) Way to devote 15 minutes to PETA.  According to Rose\\, the whole trip to the planet (which was to save the Rebel fleet) wasn't worth while unless they let this stupid horse thing go back to it's herd....really?  Ugh. \\n\\n9) Captain Phasma\\, another useless and wasted character. Not sure what her purpose in all this was.\\n\\n10) Gen. Hux...great actor\\, irritating character.\\n\\n11) There were 3 or 4 times when I thought the movie was about to end but it would just keep going\\, there is definitely something off with the pacing.\\n\\n12) Only people worse than the First Order\/Empire? Rich people. They pretty much said it like that. Yeah\\, we get it.\\n\\nThose are just the things on top of my head.  I tried to ignore them so I could enjoy the parts that I did like\\, but they had me leaving the theater feeling like I was punched in the gut.  I enjoyed the idea behind the plot\\, and I enjoyed the change of pace compared to other SW films\\, but I did not leave the theater feeling like I enjoyed my experience.  I felt more satisfied watching Rogue One than this.","true":true}
