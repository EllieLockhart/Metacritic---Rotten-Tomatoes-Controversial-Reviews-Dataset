Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These reviews are paid for. There is LITERALLY no other reason that this got the reviews it did. \\n\\nSo many plot holes it is unfathomable. Writing was garbage. Explain to me this. BB8 was the one that got Rose and Finn caught on Snoke's ship. But then when they get caught\\, they somehow miss capturing BB8. Then BB8 comes in and saves Rose & Finn from the bad guys... WHAT? Also\\, what the hell was with Leia flying around in space?  I mean. I could go on and on. \\n\\nAlso just FYI\\, Disney\\, when Kylo Ren showed his pecs half our movie theater burst out laughing. No offense to the way the guy looks (that wasn't it). It just was so random in placement that people just burst out laughing. Cus WHY?","true":true}
