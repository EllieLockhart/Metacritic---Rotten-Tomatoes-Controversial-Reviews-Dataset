Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very little plot development punctuated by several big moments. This movie turned all of the men into flawed\\, weak characters while making all of the women into the embodiment of perfection. What is wrong with having both strong women and brave and courageous men? The purple haired lady was the single most pointless character in all of Star Wars. This movie was a huge disappointment.","true":true}
