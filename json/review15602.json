Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie as a Star Wars fan I don't see why hardcore NERDS are disliking it\\nit just disappointing on the fans side of things when it is a great movie and much better than the prequels and this new trilogy so far seems to me be holding up quite well to the original trilogy I can't wait for episode 9","true":true}
