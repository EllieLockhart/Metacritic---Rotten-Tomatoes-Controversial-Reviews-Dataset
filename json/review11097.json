Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"highlighst of the movie:\\n- 2017 jedi come with built in facetime. They talk to each other anytime of the day.\\n- Also apparently a soldier uniform is much better protecting you from a destroying ship then the storm trooper armor.\\n- Now Yoda can cast lighting from ghost-town\\n- Ghost anakin and obi wan were in the bathroom on that scene.\\n- Apparently the dark side is more like a dark asshole of a mountain. GREAT!\\n- Jedi Leia can fly in space. Ships are not needed","true":true}
