Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler free review As a Star Wars fan I am just as conflicted as Kylo Ren after seeing The Last Jedi. I loved that this film challenged Star Wars lore and shown us it\u2019s ok to do so. The new feel of this Galaxy far far away is worthy of the originals. ","true":true}
