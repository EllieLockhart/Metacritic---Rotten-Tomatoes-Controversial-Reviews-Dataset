{"101487":163926,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Read the other negative reviews. No\\, these are not from bots or rabid purists or foreign saboteurs... this is a bad movie\\, just garbage whether SW is in the title or not.\\n\\nI'm no super dork or fan boy- I loved the characters of original Star Wars movies because they embodied the classical Campbellian 'Hero's Journey'. It wasn't all about the special effects or CGI\\, it was THE STORY. The characters! TLJ fails utterly in that regard.\\n\\nIf you were a fan of and alive to see the original movies (SW\\,ESB\\,RoTJ) in the theater\\, this movie made it very clear that you are not the audience these new Star Wars movies are made for any longer. If you expected an intelligent\\, engaging\\, fun\\, well-rounded story or anything enticing and satisfying that the trailers seemed to promise\\, you left sadly disappointed.\\n\\nI was with a theater half-full of all kinds of families\/people (tweens\\, teens\\, Millennials\\, Gen Xers\\, boomers) for a Monday afternoon showing\\, and I can tell you that once the end credits finally rolled\\, it was dead silent. No cheers. No applause. I'd never experienced that at the end of a Star Wars movie before. \\n\\nPerhaps that is because no one could believe that what we just sat through was a Star Wars movie... or what a plodding\\, sophomoric\\, dumpster fire of canon-mocking\\, beloved character destroying\\, forced-down-your-throat trendy social justice warrior \/ identity politics messaging that Disney had fooled us all into shelling out our hard earned money for. \\n\\nAll men were deliberately portrayed as cowards\\, exploiters\\, opportunists\\, mutineers\\, First Order villains or otherwise needed to be corrected\/controlled by a woman. Finn is a moronic loser. Poe needed to be slapped. Hux is a dim stooge. Snoke is turned into an unimportant\\, no-backstory\\, cartoonish sliced salami. \\n\\nEven Jedi Master Luke Skywalker... son of Darth Vader\\, trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda\\, is beaten by a nobody girl-child begot of planet Jakku junkie parents with about only five minutes experience with The Force and Jedi zero training. She beats Luke Skywalker with his own old light saber. Because he's now just a broken\\, failed\\, self-hating Caucasian patriarchal representation. Yeah- SURE! The greatest iconic protagonist movie character in generations is an now old white guy\\, therefore he must be utterly humiliated and turned into a pathetic\\, selfish coward that wanted to kill his sister's only child and can now only hate himself and suck space walrus teat while waiting to die. And pyromaniac ghost Yoda thinks that just fine\\, btw. \\n\\nOh and everyone is a Jedi now! No years of hard work\\, no self discipline\\, no master\/pupil relationship needed! Nope\\, everyone is a super special Force snowflake! This is Safe Space tantrum generation Star Wars- if you want it\\, you should have it RIGHT NOW- not work for anything or learn\/listen to your elders... nope\\, you don't have to learn history or bother to improve at anything. You have all the answers without any of the practical experience or comprehension\/application of any lessons! Everyone gets a Jedi participation trophy! \\n\\nOh\\, and you can use the Force angry- there's no Dark side. It's all just inside everyone to do whatever they want\\, whenever they want because there is no morality... because the past doesn't matter! That is\\, unless you're a man... in that case\\, you're a problem\\, and definitely need to be smacked\\, demoted or humiliated. Because... The Patriarchy.\\n\\nF U Rian. F U Kathleen. Where were you preachy social justice crusaders when Harvey and so many others were running wild!?! How dare you myopic hypocrites lecture anyone on anything. \\n\\nAnd a truly big F U to everyone that hired and enabled that delusionally self-involved\\, 3rd wave feminist coven of \\\"progressive script writers who helped modernize SW\\\"... Clearly passing 'Screenwriting 101' was not a criteria to join in that sad endeavor. They were fully empowered by Disney to ruin the entire Star Wars universe\/brand by inflicting 2.5 hours of Gender Studies gibberish and their own unresolved daddy \/ relationship issues on audiences that thought they paid to see the teed-up Skywalker \/ Jedi storylines carried forward from a pretty good 'The Force Awakens'.\\n\\nYou know who were strong female characters in the original and prequel SW universe? Leia! Padmi! Anakin's mother! Mon Motha! These were strong women because they were competent\\, moral\\, and rounded out characters in a strong\\, well written story! Those women didn't need pink hair and a Women's Studies post-doc in Passive Aggression towards any man to ram home some halfwit\\, current political talking point with no plot value. They were too busy being characters that mattered in a story that made sense.\\n\\nSeriously... F U to anyone that had a hand in this movie save for Mark Hamill. He died at least two movies too early and in a way that now ruins watching the original trilogy. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is the last Star Wars movie made by Disney I will ever see in the theater. I sure as hell won't buy this on DVD or watch it again. Count on that.\\n\\nJust imagine what utter dreck the Han Solo spin-off will be... Opie's reshoots won't be able to save it... Perhaps Han will be gender fluid\\, pan-sexual\\, be a champion for illegal 'aliens'\\, lead galactic White Male Privilege training classes\\, and star in an elaborate drag queen dance number... none of which would not surprise me in the least after watching TLJ.\\n\\nSW is dead.","true":true}
