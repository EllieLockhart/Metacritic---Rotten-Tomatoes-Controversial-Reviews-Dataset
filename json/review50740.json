Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bad movie. A bad sci-fi movie. And a bad Star Wars movie. Bad writing and directing... Full of plot holes. Bad jokes. Wasted opportunities for characters. Wasted opportunities for story progress. Poor performance of actors. Unnecessary and bad CGI usage. I felt like it was a joke after watching this. There will be no next time for me to watch this in a movie theater. Nope!","true":true}
