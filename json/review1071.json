Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An overused mess of complete subversions of expectation. Character and franchise consistency are nowhere to be found\\, unnecessary plot elements pad the runtime of this uninspired\\, overly political story. Characters are either stupod or are very one dimensional with unearned benefits and other elements throughout. Would be very difficult to follow and will surely deter most fans","true":true}
