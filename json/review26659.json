Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK I have very strong opinions on this movie and while those opinions are in the main negative I do have to concede that visually it combines cgi and live action seamlessly and overall looks stunning. The score is as great as you would expect from a star wars movie and is essentially perfect... However\\, this is all. As a superficial Sci-fi movie it does its job and if it didn't have 'Star Wars' in the title I would probably love it. But it does\\, and I don't. The blatant disregard for anything that came before\\, including the Force awakens is a slap in the face to everyone that had anything to do with the other 7 movies. The story is non existent\\, the plot amounts what's  essentially a really slow car chase and the characters are so contradictory it appears noone even knew what the word 'continuity' means. I could rant for hours about the holes.\\nThe most worrying thing however is the film appears to be politically charged to the point where it's ridiculous. It's like there was a list of all the key 'issues' of the day to address. That type of aggressive and arrogant agenda pushing has no place in a Sci-fi adventure let alone one aimed at children. This film is an insult to Star Wars fans young and old and a symbol of the mindless soulless rubbish that Hollywood thinks is fine to release.. It's OK as long as they sell some Porgs though right?!","true":true}
