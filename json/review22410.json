Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leaving the theater the on opening night\\, I felt like this film was maybe a 3\/5. Each additional time\\, I begin to appreciate what the film is truly about\\, and how it requires the viewer to critically analyze the film\\, characters\\, plot to better understand. This is definitely not the typical Star Wars film\\, and for good reason. \\nI recommend seeing it at least twice. It gets better with each viewing\\, though it will require you to think.","true":true}
