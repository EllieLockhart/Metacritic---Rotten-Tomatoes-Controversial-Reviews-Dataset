Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorely disappointing movie\\, an entertaining disappointment nonetheless. The Last Jedi does kill the old to start anew\\, so much that I'm not interested anymore in any new Star Wars Disney may come up with in the future. This franchise is dead to me.\\n\\nMovie should be renamed to \\\"Start Wars: The Last Disappointment\\\".","true":true}
