{"101487":172922,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The actors were fine.  The art was fine.  The plot\\, now we know why Carrie Fischer died.  The movie felt like they targeted a 3 hour runtime and was working to drag it out by adding twist after twist after twist.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi starts out okay.  At the spot where the movie should have ended\\, the whole movie takes a twist and decides to keep on going.  Everything after the twist just absolutely ruins the whole movie.  Basically\\, they made the movie too long.  I can't believe there can be an Episode 9 after this.  The plot of The Last Jedi was poorly conceived.  The story is like a rehash of \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" but now it is 2 dozen people versus a galactic army.  Nothing makes sense anymore.\\n\\nIf there is a conclusion to be made about The Last Jedi\\, we have evidence that no one managing Star Wars has any idea or direction to go.  When you want to make a trilogy\\, you should have a direction for all three films.  If you don't have a direction for any sequels\\, then don't plan ahead saying there will be a trilogy.","true":true}
