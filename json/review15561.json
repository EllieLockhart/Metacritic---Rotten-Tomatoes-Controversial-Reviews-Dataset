Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved that this Star Wars film had actual meat on its bones\\, it really explored and commented on the nature of good and evil\\, not like it's previous films which assumed the nature of good and evil. I thought the acting was great\\, the script was fun and illuminating\\, the action up to par. Not sure what folks are upset about\\, The Last Jedi is a fine film\\, as good as the last.","true":true}
