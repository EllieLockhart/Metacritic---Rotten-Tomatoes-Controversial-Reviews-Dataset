Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what a disaster.. this was a blocky stream of plot holes\\, shallow character development\\, cringy humor\\, etc\\,. Rian Johnson has destroyed star wars. I should've known when Mark Hamill said that he fundamentally disagrees with what Rian Johnson had done to Luke Skywalker. I mean this movie had such a huge potential for success\\, but yet just shat all over it.","true":true}
