Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney took the reigns here and it paid of spectacularly. From start to finish I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. It was really great seeing the characters grown into their own\\, and the expansion of what the force could do. The direction\\, cinematography\\, effects and acting were all top notch and what someone should expect from a star wars film\\, especially one done by disney.","true":true}
