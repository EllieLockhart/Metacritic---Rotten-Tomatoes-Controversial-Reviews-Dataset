Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The franchise name is the only thing this movie really has going for it. \\nA lot of this has been said before\\, but some of the things that really irked me are less discussed:\\n\\nLuke's character is inconsistent with what we know\\, he's a quitter who has gone from seeing light in Darth Vader to giving up on his nephew and everything good in the universe. The resistance creates serious problems for itself in the most childish of ways by refusing to communicate the most basic information. \\nThe entire fleet story was just painful.. why not have the other two cruisers just evacuate a bunch of people and run away at lightspeed rather than run out of fuel if the first order has only one tracker and is chasing\/tracking the main ship? And the first orders ultimate ship can be defeated by one large ship jumping to lightspeed? So all you need to take down the biggest powers in the galaxy are a few large shielded hulks with hyperdrives? Legendary Admiral Ackbar goes out like a chump. \\n\\nFinn and Rose's sidequest was some harry potteresq visual nightmare and actually wound up failing so spectacularly that it directly caused the death of half of the resistance. And what the heck was going on with first order BB and BB8? Did evil BB see BB8 and blow their cover only to completely lose interest in BB8 immediately afterwards? \\n\\nThe Rey\/Kylo communication scenes were really awkwardly directed. The only time you actually felt like they were seeing each other instead of just speaking into the camera was when they actually touched hands. And Rey is \\\"no one\\\" after JJ specifically said we'd know who she was at the end of VII. \\n\\nAnd so many scenes were just overdone for the sake of being flashy.. Can we not just have a phone call with Maz without her being in some bizarre unexplained firefight deathmatch? \\n\\nAnd then there were the weird scenes with plenty of build up and anticipation that went nowhere:\\nThe Finn\/Phasma fight.. It lasted just long enough that you felt the director realized \\\"well\\, this is boring\\, we could try to spice things up somehow\\, or we could just have it end within a few minutes and not deal with it\\\". Same with Rey's \\\"cave\\\" experience.. Big buildup with Luke\\, she finally goes down into the cave\/mirror thing\\, it starts off weird\\, gets boring fast\\, ends\\, no resolution\\, no purpose\\, no trial or challenge.\\nAnd why is Luke's reaction to Han's death offscreen? Oh well\\, too complicated and would take some skill as a director\\, let's just have that be off screen and not mention it again. \\n\\nThe whole thing was just a mess with gratuitous CGI and not a whole lot of direction\\, plot\\, or relatable characters who behave in rational ways.\\nIt get's two stars because it's Star Wars and there's always something cool about seeing the Falcon and Star Destroyers\\, ect. And honestly\\, it COULD have been worse. Some of the really awful rumors could have been true and taken it to a new level of terrible (Rey being Anakin\\, Luke being Snoke\\, ect.) so at least that didn't happen. But if it hadn't had the franchise to lean on\\, I think it would have been one of the worst movies for the budget ever made.\\n\\n\\nOh\\, and a couple honorable mentions as far as WTF moments:\\nLuke climbs a cliff\\, in order to get really really high and... spear fish.. with a spear that is a few hundred feet long and looks to weigh a few tons. Yep\\, there's a shore\\, but I'm going to climb a mountain and use an impossibly large spear to achieve what I could have with a net\\, fishing rod\\, or normal spear without climbing a mountain.\\n\\nChewy cooks a porg and is about to eat it when he notices a porg watching him that is so traumatized and losing it's mind that its' too scared to run and it takes a lot of effort for chewy to shoo it away... you know\\, for awkward lolz.. Later the movie is very heavy handed in telling us whipping horse creature things is bad.","true":true}
