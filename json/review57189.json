Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst movie ever made for the starwars franchise. Every one involved in that movie except Mark Hamill should be ashamed of themselves\\, they literally are ruining the fabrics of society with their absurd sjw pushed agenda.\\n\\nIt's as if they are seeking to have humans hate each other and put them in a state of civil animosity. This movie is pure garbage that destroy and humiliates beloved\/established characters by replacing them with unlikable characters that have no story to back anything in what they can acheive.\\n\\nKathleen Kennedy is the worst of the worst and she placed the worst trolls of all time to direct this movie by obviously  spitting on George Lucas hard work.\\n\\nThis is outrageous. Anyone who likes this movie is absolutely nuts and should do an immediate introspection.","true":true}
