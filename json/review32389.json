Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead. Long live Star Wars! Too many of us diehard Star Wars fans continue to live in the past\\, a past where space cowboys can do what they want\\, damn the consequences\\, and be lauded as unquestioned heroes. A past where motives were easily understood. A past that made sense for the kids we were. And it was great! And it still is! But it's also time to grow up. Time to let things go. Let the past go. It'll still be there if you want to visit it\\, but it's time to move on\\, and this film does it\\, as painful as that may be sometimes. ","true":true}
