Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi's determination to move forward comes with good and bad consequences. On one hand\\, there are genuinely shocking moments in this movie. Characters you thought were good have a dark side. Those who should be wise act foolishly\\, and a single decent act doesn't suddenly make a bad guy good. If you think you know which way this thing will go purely on a narrative level\\, you're probably wrong. For a Star Wars movie\\, that unpredictability is refreshing.","true":true}
