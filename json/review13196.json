Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think I say anything here that would be a spoiler but I do talk about the movie\\, so read at your own risk.\\n\\nThe best way for me to describe Episode 8 is that it is as if George Lucas raised his baby (which are the Star Wars movies) like a vegetarian\\, organic\\, and  pesticide free child. There is the occasional tofu and brown rice but overall the child is healthy and everyone is happy about the good environment. Then George sells to Disney (relinquishes his baby). The Mouse feeds the kid candy\\, fast food\\, Twinkies and Ho-Ho's\\, and plenty of red meat.  The kid is still the kid but with the change\\,  he looks and behaves in a vastly different way.\\n\\nThe old guard give the material dignity but except for Luke and Leia\\, they are under-utilized. It's almost as if someone remembered \\\"Oh  yeah\\, this is Star Wars. We'd better sprinkle in R2D2\\, C-3PO\\, and Chewbacca\\, as well as a few wild looking aliens. And we have to use all those newer characters\\, too.\\\" And leave it Disney to create cute characters and action scenes that translate well into merchandising.\\n\\n In their rush to tie off loose ends\\, Disney tinkered with the storyline and mythos\\, leaving scenes feeling incomplete and definitely leaving me feeling let down\\, as if (that mysterious someone again) said \\\"Oh\\, yeah\\, we have to resolve  the mystery of Rey's parents (or insert loose-end here) in this movie. We'll just add this (tweak)\\, that (tweak)\\, and ta da! Resolved.\\\" \\nThey also pretty much recycled plot devices within their own movie several times (\\\"They liked it the first time. Do it again! Do it again!\\\") How many self-sacrificing un-sung heroes do we need before we think\\, \\\"This again?\\\" How many moments of a guy we have never seen before speaking quickly into his helmet mike and blowing up mid-sentence? \\\"Oh no\\, they're dead! But wait! No\\, they're not!\\\" The tropisms were so common\\, I knew what was going to happen at the start of the scene (\\\"Oh\\, next will be the part where...\\\") The story didn't unfold-it was a quilt of bits and pieces from episodes past.\\n\\nPerhaps most off-putting for me were the times when they tried to be witty or do an homage or just chew up a little scenery! A  wink-wink tongue-in-cheek old west gun fight or the Big Bad doing his monologue and ending with  \\\"...and then I'm going to KILL YOU!\\\" I waited for \\\"BWAAAHAAAHAAAHAAA!\\\" Really\\, Disney?\\n\\nThere were things I liked: the red color under the white on the planet (you'll get it) and the interesting ways they used the color was very well done. \\nMost of the cinematography was great. \\nClassic Star Wars music\\, check. \\nI  mentioned the quiet dignity Fisher and Hamill brought to Luke and Leia. \\nThe actors were all good. \\nDespite my cynical merchandising grumble\\, I liked the Porgs. \\nThe bit with the necklace was really good-I didn't anticipate it and that made it one of my favorite parts\\nI loved the diversity of the rebel alliance members and it was particularly striking against the rigid conformity of the empire. \\nI thought the fight scene near the throne was good. \\nThere is a subtle use of The Force at the end that was a lovely touch. \\nAn old friend makes an appearance when needed by Luke and I thought that scene was the only one that really captured the spirit of Star Wars. That\\, and Rey's hair on the island. Crazy hair must be a female lead character \\\"thing\\\". \\n\\nShould you go see it? Sure. Everyone will be talking about it-you should have an opinion\\, too. You will be entertained.","true":true}
