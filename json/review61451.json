I\u2019ve never taken a journey like this in a video game. By far one of the most complex and detailed games I\u2019ve ever played. Every detail in the game matters and is a part of the theme.

By far one of the most complex and detailed games I\u2019ve ever played. Every detail in the game matters and is a part of the theme. The game play is phenomenal and allows for a realistic adventure with very well paced waves of several enemy types. The evolution of gameplay from the first game is spectacular and introduces new things to interact with while there are also new dangers to worry about in combat. Characters and violence have extreme highs and lows\\, and although at some point all of the characters made some kind of upsetting choice\\, I never once felt it didn\u2019t belong in the story. The story makes sense. The decisions they make align with the characters and what happens aligns with this universe. It\u2019s hard and hurts\\, as it should in a harsh world where there is never a safe moment or rarely a \u201chappy ending\u201d for these characters. The diversity in the cast and characters from age\\, sexuality\\, body types\\, etc. is very natural and it feels good to play such a widely known game that does it so well. I laughed and smiled so wide at humor and absolutely stunning scenes\\, cried sad and happy tears where I felt so intensely for the characters\\, and I nearly crapped myself at some of the encounters with new enemy types. Well deserved 10\/10 for overall attention to detail in every aspect. I have never played anything like it and it\u2019s hard to accept that not all other games will feel the same after this amazing piece of art.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
