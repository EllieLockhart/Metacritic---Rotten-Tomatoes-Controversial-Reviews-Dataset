Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful film all around.  Dreadful new characters from \\\"Rose the annoying\\\" to \\\"Porgs: the obvious attempt to sell plushies\\\".  \\n\\nWhat I can't understand is how the audience score is not at 30%.  Disney must be bankrolling the executives at Rotten Tomatoes to ensure that the reviews don't fall below 50%.  No other explanation would suffice.\\n\\nThis movie deserves zero stars for the horrible new characters\\, plot holes galore and terrible dialogue.  I gave it 1 star for the music and scenery.  And for some solid performances by Driver\\, Ridley\\, Issacs\\, Boyega and of course\\, Hammil and Fisher.","true":true}
