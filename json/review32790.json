Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an overly long and mundane film with very few new ideas or original plot. My son and I were both disappointed and I'm amazed at the \\\"Profeesional Critic\\\" reviews which have obviously been bought and paid for by Disney. I've been watching this Franchise since 1977 and I can honestly say this is probably the worse one. Some of the new characters are appalling and I was hoping they all got killed off. I won't pay cinema prices for the next one\\, i will wait for it to come onto Television.","true":true}
