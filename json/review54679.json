Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really can't say much more that hasn't been covered in other negative reviews. It was incompetent and lazy writing. It was as if Johnson was too arrogant or proud to follow the storyline Abrams had laid out. History will not be kind to this movie and Johnson shouldn't be directing commercials\\, much less SW. Sooo much was wrong with this movie\\, if you had started to make connections with any of the characters in TFA\\, that connection will be completely obliterated in this monstrosity. Oh\\, and I'm not a bot\\, just a pissed off fan who thinks Luke deserved better and so did the fans that buy tickets. Try using a focus group next time you morons. It deserves negative stars.","true":true}
