Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this movie.  It was very well done and the acting was fantastic. It brought tears to my eyes a few times with a sense of nostalgia for the original movies.  The action sequences were well done. I enjoyed the \\nhumor but could see why some reviewers might dislike the timing of the jokes. The story was not exactly what I expected but enjoyable and definitely not predictable. I agree with the professional reviews this is the movie of the year!","true":true}
