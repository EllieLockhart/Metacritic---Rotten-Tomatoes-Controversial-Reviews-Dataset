Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"its a no brainier what is wrong with this movie\\, but to sum it up without repeating what others have previously written - spaceballs 2 not Star Wars. This is a fine example of making a film and not knowing your audience. \\n\\nImagine they did another Harry Potter with a new main character that instantly knew everything and school wasn't required - just undermines the previous hp films and that is what sw8 has done regarding this saga.
