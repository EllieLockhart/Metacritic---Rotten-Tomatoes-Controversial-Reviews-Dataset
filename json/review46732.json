Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weird\\, INTERESTING\\, nuanced. Could've used some serious help with the screenplay. Not a fan of the prequel-style slapstick humour or the irrelevant subplots but the bones here are great and the main stuff is done right (at least in my opinion). Rey and Kylo stuff is great. Luke and Leia stuff is brilliant. Overall there are too many characters who don't add to Rey's journey. Good film\\, mediocre 2nd film in a trilogy. The third one needs to be amazing.","true":true}
