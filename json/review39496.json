Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film's Meta-narrative structure was thoroughly infuriating. Just tell the damn story already-- you don't have to make every single line (\\\"Let the past die\\,\\\" \\\"You want me to take on the entire first order with a laser sword?\\\") a character's message to the audience about the direction the writing process is taking. This is an example of the Marvel-ified STAR WARS  winking at its' own intrinsic absurdity and asking the audience to take the stakes seriously when its' central character bafflingly doesn't anymore. The reverse-engineered decision by Luke which creates Kylo Ren is completely out-of-character and his self-imposed exile is forced\\, weak\\, and a total head-scratcher\\, leaving his attempt at redemption and ultimate fate hollow\\, unsatisfying and infuriating to longtime fans. Johnson misfires way too many times by inserting hit-us-all-over-the-head social commentary into a ridiculous side-plot at the expense of characters who absolutely deserve to have that precious time devoted to them. I don't care what happens in episode IX\\, and I've loved STAR WARS all my life. Good luck\\, JJ Abrams- you have your work cut our for you...","true":true}
