Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Doing a fantastic job in fleshing out its characters and their motivations even more amid exciting battle scenes and intelligent twists\\, The Last Jedi proves to be one of the most mature\\, epic and consistent films of the franchise to date in the way it explores its main themes.","true":true}
