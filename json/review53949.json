{"101487":129325,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am afraid the critics have all been paid. \\n\\nRogue One was good. Maybe 65% good. Force Awakens was bad\\, maybe 40% bad. I am afraid this is 10%. \\n\\nMore so than the last movie\\, many ideas and even exact scenes have been taken from the previous movies. This was by far not the biggest problem. Very little is explained about the new or old characters.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi DOES NOT honor the saga`s rich legacy. I am no die-hard fan\\, and i have seen most of the movies only once on TV. Especially Luke seems completely disconnected from the past.\\n\\nSpace battles are utterly bad. It is hard to describe how bad\\, but basically it works as if the spaceships have been built in nineteen century\\, and the soldiers trained in sixteenth. Some huge ships seem powerless. Very small lightly armed ships can destroy anything. Surface battle is WW1 like\\, somehow ignoring present air\/space support.\\n\\nGenerally the producers completely gave up on making the universe believable in any way. Explosive decompression means nothing\\, hatches are opened to space many times with no impact.  Battles seem to wait for romantic conversations. \\n\\nThe critic s lie. Do not go movies. This was only the second time in my live i considered leaving the cinema.","true":true}
