Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very critical of TFA. I didn't like it. Last Jedi is amazing. People who are oh so serious must have the forgotten that Star Wars started as a space western.  The first trilogy was two parts tongue in cheek with a side of The Empire Strikes Back. That's the formula here and it works.  I read reviews of people who are mad at the science. They bought a ticket to a movie about a mystical force permeating the universe--either suspend your disbelief or don't.","true":true}
