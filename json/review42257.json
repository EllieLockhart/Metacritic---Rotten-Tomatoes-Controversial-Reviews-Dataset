Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie subverts your expectations in the best way possible. A lot of people won't like the way Ryan Johnson approaches Star Wars\\, but I thought it was a breath of fresh air for a series that has focused way too much on shoehorned nostalgia the previous two installments.","true":true}
