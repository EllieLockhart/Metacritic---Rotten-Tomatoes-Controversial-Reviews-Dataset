Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time star wars fan and I thought the movie was a massive let down. The reason I didn't like it is nothing to do with \\\"it wasn't like star wars\\\". I don't want give spoilers away so will try not to BUT I MIGHT\\, SO PLEASE AVOID IF NOT SEEN IT YET...\\n\\n: I felt there was too many Disney \/ Avengers type jokes. And I'm not bothered by a bit  of swearing in a movie\\, but \\\"earth\\\" swear words just don't work in the star wars universe. The storyline in the middle about the ships was just daft; the appearance of a particular character and what he did to a tree was just so totally weird: I've never seen a Disney snow white moment in a Star wars film before ; I felt dissatisfied with three plot \/ story archs from TFA into TLJ....  Plot holes galore.... Huge rubber fish?!?......\\n\\nSo I'm more than happy for new star wars to be totally different to original star wars\\, that's fine with me. I felt this film\\, as the second in a new trilogy\\, destroyed the previous story arch. It made the stories from TFA a waste of time. \\n\\nBit confused why the \\\"professional critics\\\" are raving quite so much. Are they creeping up to Disney?","true":true}
