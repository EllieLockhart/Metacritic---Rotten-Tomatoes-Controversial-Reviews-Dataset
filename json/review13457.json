Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I entered the start of the movie with an open mind\\, but man was this movie bat$hit crazy. I couldn't help but smirk when Princess Leia awoke from death while floating in space  and started to magically fly.  I couldn't help but laugh when Luke Skywalker is portrayed as a literal man cave dwelling\\, heavy handed metaphor for the fanbase. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at every scene with commander menopause\\, purple hair and the \\\"out of control\\, irresponsible\\, meat headed fly boy\\\" Poe.  I was ready to like this movie and wanted to\\, I really did\\, but injecting the film with so much agenda driven identity politics was HUGE mistake.  And this is coming from someone who calls himself a democratic socialist. \\n\\nIf this is the future of the Star Wars series\\, then no thanks. I like my sci-fi to be as far from the current political landscape as possible.","true":true}
