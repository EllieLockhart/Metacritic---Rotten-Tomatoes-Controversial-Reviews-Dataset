Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really surprised that Disney permitted Rian Johnson to make so many bold decisions about the direction on this trilogy.  It effectively makes it his \\\"baby\\\" and it's hard to imagine why he wasn't chosen to helm the final film.  I'm happy to see this film reflecting some of the prequels themes cinematically.  While the prequels have been derided by many fans\\, you can not deny they are a major part of this story and the 3rd act must reflect the themes of the 1st act heavily.  Rian Johnson did a great job at this\\, we'll see if JJ can pull off the same.  He will somehow have to reflect episode 1 very heavily if this story is to be finished.","true":true}
