Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went opening night and I think this one really missed the mark. I went into this this thinking it would be as epic as the last two. \\n\\nSeems to me this was a filler-from the fake looking porgs\\, some parts with bad acting and the cheesy jokes I give this a 3\/5. The opening fight scene was like every other Star Wars. An x wing \\nshooting at an Empire ship. There wasn't much suspense and I knew what was going to happen next. Disney is also babying down Star Wars way too much. It just felt like something major was missing from this one\\, something that production might have cut out and shouldn't have. It didn't flow and didn't seem like JJ's working.\\n \\nIt is theater worthy though\\, as it would get an even lower score from me if watched at home.","true":true}
