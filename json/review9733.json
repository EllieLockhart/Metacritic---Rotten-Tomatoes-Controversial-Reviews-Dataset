{"101487":124051,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good things:\\n1. Visuals. \\n2. Actors play. Good performances especially of Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamilton\\, Daisy is not so bad at all but she could ride her convoluted always-look of confusion - it is not even matching her character of being independent. Suprisingly\\, even the characters were pissing me off\\, the actors did the best. This is what everyone can agree to be honest.\\n\\nBad things.\\n1. Plotholes.\\n2. Unnecessary b-plots (like Canto Bright)\\n3. There is no logic in this movie. Bombs pulled off vertically because there is gravity in space\\, Leia blowed up to the space and then flying back to the ship with force.\\n4. Twist-over-twist. I think the critics like the film because it subverts all your expectation. Who is Snoke? Meh\\, nobody. He got killed by a brat who is supposed to be the next intimidating villain. Haha\\, I do not get it and I am not excited. Who are Knights of Ren? Meh\\, who cares. So you have to say\\, its subverting ALL expectation a good thing itself? Well\\, if you cannot write a story that is consistent\\, definitely not. It is easy to subvert expectations just by not telling anything.\\n5. Deconstruction and destruction of Luke Skywalkers character. The symbol of good\\, honesty and HOPE (Episode IV's name \\\"The New Hope\\\" was not in vain!) turns out to be grumpy\\, whiny douchebag. He tried - against all the hope and all people - turn his father to good knowing he is a mass murder. But just sensing that could be darkness in his nephew - son of his sister and best friend with whom he gone to the war - he said - e\\, f*ck it\\, lets kill him. \\n6. Ideology. There is so obvious propaganda in this film and it is served with every second line. Anticapitalism\\, pacifism\\, animal rights\\, children rights\\, forced diversity among the cast\\, feminism: all important position on Rebels side are held by women\\, wiceadmiral Holdo bashing Poe Dameron for having overtestosteron dose\\, all white men are a) fascist yelling at everyone around\\, b) life failures (starting with Han Solo who made divorce with his wife and left his child). When you have put ideology like that - at least be subtle and do it with consistency and artistry. \\n7. There is no difference at all - there is no originality. Just because The Last Jedi does not tell anything about main points made in TFA and subvert this way all expectation of the fans - but is not originall at all. Crate is nothing like Hoth (I suspect that in original cut of the movie this was the beginning of the film)\\, Dreadnought is nothing like Superdestroyer\\, Luke is living like a hermit just as Yoda did\\, Rey is new Luke\\, Imperium chase the ship(s) of Rebels\\, we have speeders fighting on Hoth\\, pardon\\, Crate. The same old\\, but with new merchandising creatures and just edited in slight different order. \\n8. Sense of humor and merchandising creatures - Disney at its best. I must say\\, nothing like plotholes\\, lack of logic\\, lack of motivations was telling me to leave the cinema before end like this retarded attempts to be funny. Yo mama jokes in Star Wars? Luke and cow with blue alcoholic milk? No.\\n9. One of the main arch in movie is the chase of imperial ships trying to get the rebels ship. This was so slow and lacking of any logic I could spent five hours to telling how stupid it was. Why the imperium ship did not just make jump into hyperspace once and then jump again to get closer to the rebels? Why not call for help the other parts of the fleet? \\n10. Rose character. When you saw the film you know why. It is not of surprise than the Chinese people turn against the film. If Rose character was to catch the chinese audience it was doing in the most insulting way possible\\, because Rose is dump retarded idiot that was used to express ideology and not to make any sens at all. And Chinese are people with commons sense and they did not buy it and this is why in the second week the revenue of TLJ was dropped in China by 94%. \\nYou could say the same for the Afroamericans\\, the film tries to be diverse\\, but honestly\\, Finn was no less idiot than Rose. He had a chance for being hero\\, but the Rose destroyed it by... flying into his ships and make dumbest comment ever. When Finn was a white male from my country\\, I would be feel offened by the way Disney has seen me. Nice job\\, Disney Diversity - in the end\\, you even screw your own assumptions.","true":true}
