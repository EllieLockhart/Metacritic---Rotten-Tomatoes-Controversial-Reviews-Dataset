Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers Below: This movie was terrible.  So many plot holes and unused character arches.  Things that were setup in The Force Awakens were completely thrown out here.  There is no longer any imminent threat going into the third movie.  After reading all of the Luke Skywalker stories about how powerful he is\\, This movie set up a perfect moment to show that off...and then completely flushed it down the toilet.  The only reason I can think that this movie has a current 93% on Rotten Tomatoes is because reviewers were paid off.  This movie ruined star wars for me and I'm no longer looking forward to future movies...Thank you Rian Johnson","true":true}
