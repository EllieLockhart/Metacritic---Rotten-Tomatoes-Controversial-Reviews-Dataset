Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an absolute insult to all star wars fans. Trashes on everything that J.J set up in the force awakens. The writing\\, directing and acting is abysmal\\, as is the editing. This movie has no flow\\, it is all over the place with ridiculous plots that could have been cool and purposeful had they been written better\\, but ultimately it is a 2.5hr long cat and mouse chase that has no pay off. i went to the midnight screening excited as to see this. I have waited 2 years and I have been completely let down. I am gutted. What a pile of turds. There were a couple of cool moments that I really enjoyed\\, but ultimately this movie fails. I don't even care for episode 9 now\\, I am just so disappointed by this movie\\, such a disgrace. Watch at your own risk. it definitely will not go the way that you think.\\n1.5\/5","true":true}
