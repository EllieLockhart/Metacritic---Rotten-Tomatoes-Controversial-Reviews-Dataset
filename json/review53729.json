Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Godspeed Rebels\\\" says admiral Purple Hair Gender Studies.\\n\\nGodspeed? Like \\\"God spede\\\"? Who is God in Star Wars? Why not use the more appropriate \\\"May the Force be with you\\\"?\\n\\nAnd what about \\\"Rebels\\\"? Aren't we talking about Resistance in this movie? Is Rebellion a synonym of Resistance? No\\, Rian\\, it's not. They are two different concepts\\, but you are too ignorant to know it.\\n\\nTwo errors in the same phrase. Good job Rian!\\n\\nMay the Force be with us all\\, dear Star Wars fans. We will need every ounce of it.","true":true}
