Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2 words! Bantha Fodder! I'm a lifetime fan of Star Wars. I was even onboard with the Disney takeover. Rouge One was great! TFA even though many have complained it was much like New Hope\\, it honored Han Solo in death. It had JJ Abrams mystery box element\\, and we all wanted to know\\, who is Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? Why does C3PO have a red arm? Then\\, ALL that anticipation and great pre-movie marketing was crushed by seeing the actual movie! SPOILER ALERT: I mean come on! Snoke died a meaningless death. Rey's parents are no one? Leia now has superpowers! We have political correctness shoved down our throats. We have a meaningless story line with Rose and Finn. Seriously\\, their parts could totally be lifted from the story\\, it would have added nothing. I was a kid during 4\\,5\\,&6. My kids grew up with 1\\,2\\,&3. Contrary to some\\, we did NOT hate the prequels. But\\, if this movie is any indication of where Disney is taking the Star Wars franchise\\, the Last Jedi is my Last movie. It totally ignored the storyline of all of them and Disney decided they would just milk these thing kinda like those things Luke was milking on Ahch-To\\, they are milking this thing to make money NOT tell a good story any longer. And they will make money. But\\, as for me\\, my faith in them is lost. Let's just hope JJ can clean up this mess\\, but I don't even think I'll go to the theatre this next time.","true":true}
