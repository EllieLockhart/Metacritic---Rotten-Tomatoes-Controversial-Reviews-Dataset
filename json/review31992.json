Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead. This movie was garbage. \\nWhat a terrible excuse for a Star Wars film. The amount of plot holes and forced diversity was the only bigger issue for me than the god-awful writing of the lines for all the one-dimensional characters that aren't named Kylo Ren. (He is the only interesting person in the entire movie). Luke's character was absolutely ruined. Finn and Rose were completely useless and their storyline full of propaganda and subliminal messages made me sick. Instead of giving Leia a beautiful death\\, she somehow used the force to survive the open space\\, and she ended up in a coma for most of the movie anyway. The porgs were cute\\, but practically nothing else could force the scowl off my face. \\nThere was only one scene that was particularly pleasant to watch\\, which was the fight between Rey\/Kylo and the red guards\\, which reminds me: who the hell is Snoke\\, and why did they kill him off without any backstory whatsoever?!\\n Overall\\, by far the worst Star Wars movie yet\\, and yes that includes the prequels.","true":true}
