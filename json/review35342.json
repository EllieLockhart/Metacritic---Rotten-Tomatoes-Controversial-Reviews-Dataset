Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The initial reaction is that it was a very entertaining movie\\, but a few minutes after the movie you realize the plot holes and lack of character development.  There is one storyline that is not even necessary.  We learned nothing about Snoke and his character needed more backstory for the payoff.  This movie is not as good as 'The Force Awakens' while being about 75% as derivative of the earlier movies.","true":true}
