Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love the director\\, and it only got better on the second viewing. I had some problems such as Holdo and the underuse of phasma\\, but i love kylo and rey and fin and\\, unlike others\\, Rose. In all a movie I will watch again many times.","true":true}
