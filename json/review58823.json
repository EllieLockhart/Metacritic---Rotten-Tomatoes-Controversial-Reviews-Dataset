Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This piss poor game was so unsatisfying and was a drag to play. The way they put an end to Joel even though he was the main protagonist on the first title was such a disservice to that character and its fans\\, especially so early on in the game which made his death more of a plot device than anything else. Elly looks and sounds dead. She\u2019s not the same character who I loved in the first title. This game consists of subpar writing and lines with major plot holes. Multiple scenes that are a cringe-fest and it\u2019s dragged out story. It\u2019s like the writers didn't know when to end the game. At a certain point I wasn\u2019t even having fun anymore\\, I just wanted it to end. But it didn\u2019t. To top it off you get forced to play Abby just to see her pov in an attempt to humanize that character but demonize Elly even more. She had little to no character development for me to even want to sympathize with her. I find it quite ironic that Abby goes out to kill \u2018scars\u2019 but as soon as a couple saves her\\, she has a change of heart to help them almost instantaneously. But when Joel and Tommy save her\\, the game decides to torture Joel and end his life with a golf club. This was a horrible game. These \u2018top critics\u2019 are lying out of their teeth and there is no ambition in criticism\/journalism anymore because they probably get paid to put on a front that this game is as good as they\u2019re describing it. Naughty Dogs and Neil Whateverman can keep their third title if they ever plan on making one because this disaster of a game with it\u2019s repetitive missions lost me as a fan. I\u2019m going to slowly remove the sequel out of my head and act like it never came out. BAD. End of review.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
