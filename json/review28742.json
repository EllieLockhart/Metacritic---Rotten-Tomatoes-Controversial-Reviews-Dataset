Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite an enjoyable and compelling addition to the Star Wars universe!  The movie was definitely a bit of a roller coaster in some aspects\\, and without spoiling too much it gets downright bleak at times.  That being said\\, it embodies the hope that the rebellion has been about since the get-go.  \\nI like the fact that we get to see new characters take the forefront a bit\\, as the greats we admire pass on the torch and continue the magic.  Really makes me look forward to what this franchise has to offer in the future!","true":true}
