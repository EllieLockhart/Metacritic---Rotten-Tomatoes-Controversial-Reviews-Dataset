Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was awful. It was silly and disappointing. Very slap sticky. No character development. Nothing memorable. It sets up zero interest for the sequel. In 20 years no one is going to give a damn about any of these new characters. This movie wasted everything JJ Abrams did with The Force Awakens. I do not understand who thought this film should have been made. Star Wars have become Pirates of the Caribbean - Non sensical. I literally don\u2019t care what happens next. I don\u2019t care about Rey or Kylo of Finn or Poe. The Force Awakens had cliffhangers. There are no more cliffhangers. And the new characters are pretty dull. Also\\, the title \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense once you see the film. The entire thing is ridiculous. Can George Lucas and Mark Hamill remake this film as a not-for-profit fan film? ","true":true}
