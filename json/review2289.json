Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Travesty. A slap in the face to Star Wars fans. I am a Star Wars fan and have been since I was a kid\\, I have seen every Star Wars movie multiple times\\, and I have watched the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series multiple times. I will never watch the Last Jedi again. I can't believe they released this movie\\, they are doing a Star Wars trilogy without having the story planned out beforehand\\, they are just making it up as they go. How can that be possible? What terrible leadership\\, Kathleen Kennedy needs to be fired. How could anyone think this movie is good enough to give Rian Johnson his own trilogy....I hope Disney smartens up quick and fires Kathleen Kennedy\\, she has turned Star Wars into soulless sci-fi garbage packed with SJW lefty politics. I'm questioning if I am even a Star Wars fan anymore\\, they would have to retcon most of this movie in the next one or just straight up remove it from canon entirely and re do it. I am so disappointed and sad that this is what has become of Star Wars.","true":true}
