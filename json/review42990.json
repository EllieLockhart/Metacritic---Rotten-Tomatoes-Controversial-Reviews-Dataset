Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible\\, there are so many plot holes and unexplained circumstances\\, unnatural dialogue (especially after Leia is saved)\\, timeline inconsistencies and general star wars cannon common-knowledge tropes of the star wars universe also heavily inconsistent\\, such as hyperspace ships being used as weapons. It's just a total mess. The movie completely turns the previous characterisation of luke skywalker onto its head and it was just baffling to watch. I left the cinema feeling confused and empty\\, I have no idea what could possibly come with episode 9 but frankly I don't care anymore. We still have the original trilogy and nothing can take that away\\, as much as Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy would like to.\\nThe only redeeming quality about this film is it's visual effects. But not even its cinematography or anything\\, just the cgi effects\\, because the red throne-room scene is hilariously poorly choreographed. It's clearly a dance routine and not a fight: totally breaks any immersion this film struggled to garner up until that point.\\n\\nJust. Terrible.","true":true}
