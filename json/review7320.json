Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 7 was the worse starwars movie until I watched episode 8. Saver your money and skip this. If you really want to watch this I would just rent it when its out on DVD\/Blueray or pirate it.","true":true}
