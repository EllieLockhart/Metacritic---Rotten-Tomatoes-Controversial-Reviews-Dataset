Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It hurts me to say this movie was terrible.  Poor directing\\, awful dialogue\\, and story was a mess.  I was really hoping this film would bring the Star Wars magic back.  At times I thought I was watching a bad tv comedy sitcom:(.","true":true}
