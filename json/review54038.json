Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand that hardcore fans might be disappointed about aspects of that movie but these are not as dramatic as they describe. After rethinking most of the doubtful scenes I must admit that these do make sense and the production designed it very conscious and in its own way. In my opinion they analyzed the old movies quite well and asked themselves the right questions how the story might continue and the characters develop.\\n\\nWhile they did the most interesting parts right\\, I must admit that the screenplay lacks with bad quality in details. Somewhere they made it for themselves too easy or ignored the logic absolutely. Some scenes are also just designed to play for time and not really necessary or don't push the story forward at all. Besides that obviously\\, the director had issues to handle all top characters equally too.\\n\\nDespite all these pros and cons I must say that the movie makes much fun and is in my opinion a much a better presentation of the saga than The Force Awakens. \\nFinally\\, that circumstance directed me to support the movie with all 5 stars :)","true":true}
