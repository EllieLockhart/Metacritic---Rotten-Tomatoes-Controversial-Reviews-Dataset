Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An insult to Star Wars fans everywhere. A 2.5 hour middle finger to everything Star Wars stands for. An arrogant swipe to two years of fan speculations and external worldbuilding via the expanded canon. Rampant 3rd wave feminism and SJW dogma throttling a once beloved universe. This is a hate letter to Star Wars.\\nThat stated\\, there were some very good sceens. The Bombing run\\, the Acht-to scenes\\, Snoke.. These were very well done. Kylo Ren at his best in this film.","true":true}
