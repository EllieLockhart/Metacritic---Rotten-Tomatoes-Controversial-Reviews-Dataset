Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly they have ruined Star Wars. To say the Last Jedi is the worst movie in the series would be a vast understatement. This movie has more plot holes than swiss cheese. The supreme villian is a wimp\\, Kylo Ren is a temper tantrum throwing cry baby who couldn't lead or fight his way out of a wet paper bag\\, they completely annihilated Lukes character\\, the animation is ridiculously poor and stupid (I thought JarJar was bad then game the stupid looking birds in this movie)\\, the main character Rey is completely boring (tell me again how she knows how to wield a light saber with no training)? She would cut her darn leg off. What was the purpose of going to the island. Waste of time. This movie served no purpose except to get rid of Luke. Here is the plot and what a stupid plot it is. We are about out of gas so lets cruise along until we run out. Sad way to ruin a great franchise.","true":true}
