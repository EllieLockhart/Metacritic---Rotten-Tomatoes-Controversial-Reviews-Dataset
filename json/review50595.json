Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"34 years awaiting Skywalker's return and this is what happens?  I'm sorry but I am disappointed in what I feel is quite a confusing collage of a rehashed storyboard and strange character actions.  Don't you remember the beauty of the story of Star Wars?  Full of political and philosophical undertones packaged in a Science Fiction film?  Please for future pursuit craft story before effects.  Overall disappointed in this film but grateful for episodes 4\\, 5\\, and 6 where Luke can truly share Star Wars magic with my children as he did with me in my youth.","true":true}
