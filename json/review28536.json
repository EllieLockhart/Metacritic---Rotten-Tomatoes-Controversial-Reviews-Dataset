Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably my least favorite Star Wars movie\\, as the middle part of the trilogy I was disappointed that many of the aspects I was excited to see more of (knights of ren\\, snoke\\, Luke) were completely ignored or worse. Driver steals the show completely this episode. Sadly my favorite characters from episode 7 (Poe and Finn) were also butchered. The insane power creep in the Star Wars universe is also on full display.","true":true}
