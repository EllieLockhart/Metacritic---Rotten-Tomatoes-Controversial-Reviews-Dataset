Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie! This is not Star Wars. This is not Luke Skywalker. Terribly made with bad new character and a total disregard and disrespect for the original characters. A total disaster of a movie. Rian Johnson and Kathlene Kennedy MUST GO!!!","true":true}
