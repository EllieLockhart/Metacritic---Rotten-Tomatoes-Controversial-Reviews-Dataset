Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, that's that.  I can understand why fans hate this movie.  Leia in space\\, give me a break!  \\n\\nRJ did a great job in running two years of anticipation with the initial scene with Luke & Rey.  The OJ Simpsonesque chase through space was tedious at best.  \\n\\nThe only good thing I can say is that at least there will be no anticipation for the next one.","true":true}
