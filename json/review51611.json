Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"actually the worst star wars film unbelievable (in the universe of star wars) things happening left and right\\, characters changing their entire moral compass shallow use of new characters while shoehorning others just to ruin basic fundamentals of star wars itself (bombers moving slowly to drop bombs in space? unshielded ships\\, making villains into a joke (hux) having luke drink blue milk and toss is lightsaber and have such unbelievable personality changes. \\nTo put it simply the reason the new trilogy hasn't done so well \\, The last jedi.","true":true}
