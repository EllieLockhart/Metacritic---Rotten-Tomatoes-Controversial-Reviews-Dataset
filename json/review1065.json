Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An outstanding Star Wars adventure. It's fun\\, surprising\\, action packed\\, true to the spirit of the originals\\, and-most importantly-A GOOD ORIGINAL STORY! \\n\\nMost of the bad reviews are a result of people not liking the new direction. For as much complaining as people did about Force Awakens being \\\"a remake of A New Hope\\\"\\, some fans seem to have wanted a remake of Empire Strikes back.\\n\\nThat's definitely not what we got with a The Last Jedi\\, so if you're hoping for a remake instead of an outstanding new entry in the series which adds to the lore and creates new interesting characters\\, I guess you'll be disappointed.","true":true}
