Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down best SW movie so far\\, the symbolism and the charachters' development make it much more than a simple sci-fi flick. I really hope they keep it up in ep IX.","true":true}
