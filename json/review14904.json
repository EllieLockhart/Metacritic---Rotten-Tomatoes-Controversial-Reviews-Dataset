Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hope the director loses his mind due to horrible reviews and takes the atrocious cast out with him. Seriously\\, to everyone giving this glowing reviews\\, you are not a fan. Either that or you weren't paying attention. Don't go watch it a second time though. Just wait and torrent it and see why the rest of us are so angry.","true":true}
