Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved this movie. \\nI understand that not everyone feels the same way - but my family loved it\\, my friends loved it - and the whole theater I watched the movie in was gasping\\, laughing\\, and clapping.\\n\\nI think the \\\"audience\\\" score is low here because people are quick to share the negative and slow to share the positive.","true":true}
