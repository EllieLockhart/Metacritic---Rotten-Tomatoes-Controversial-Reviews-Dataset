Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointing\\, irreverent\\, bloated\\, laughable (for the wrong reasons) unsatisfying chapter that will make you pine for the good old days of George and Jar Jar. My takeaway... Rian didn't like (or understand) the original trilogy and didn't bother to watch TFA.  He seemed more preoccupied with political commentary than giving Luke the debut\\, story and respect his character deserved.  The nostalgia that was the primary draw for me is gone.  Disney sees this as a cash cow and the general audience as drooling zombies that will chase after any carcass with a Star Wars label on it.  There is zero creativity in the incestuous echo chamber that is Hollywood these days and no interest on the part of anyone involved in the Disney\/Star Wars machine in making a true Star Wars movie that respects and pays homage to all that was established and loved about the original trilogy and the universe that George created.","true":true}
