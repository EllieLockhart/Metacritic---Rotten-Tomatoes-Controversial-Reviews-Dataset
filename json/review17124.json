Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie. The movie\\, like \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, played off the concepts if the previous movies. But what was enjoyable was how much it surprised me. I can admit that there were a couple questionable scenes but other than that I loved it.","true":true}
