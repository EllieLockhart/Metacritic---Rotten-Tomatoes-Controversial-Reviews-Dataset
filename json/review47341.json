Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of Time! I\u2019m sad I was so excited to see this movie they totally ruined it horrible story lots of characters that that have just should even be in the movie ! There was no wow moment in the whole movie I\u2019m very disappointed with Disney! this director sucks it was a bad story It had making for a great movie with Luke but they totally messed !
