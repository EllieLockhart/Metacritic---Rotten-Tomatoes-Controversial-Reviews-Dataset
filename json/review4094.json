Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant! i loved it\\, was long but easy to watch. Some interesting quirks\\, everyone complaining seems to be expecting massive reveals \\\"who is snoke\\\" \\\"who are reys parents\\\" just like real life\\, some stories have a dull answer. People complaining about the force use\\, but its not new\\, if they were the fans they claimed to be they would have seen it in other canon Star wars content. The movie is for the true Star Wars fan\\, really good job !","true":true}
