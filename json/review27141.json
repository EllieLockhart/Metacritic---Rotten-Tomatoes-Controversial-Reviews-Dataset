Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst movies i have ever seen.\\ni don't even know how rian got the directing role. He's a horrible director and has made zero good movies and it really shows here.\\nRian slogs us trough a movie filled with plot-holes\\, him not understanding characters and him basically not understanding filmaking 101.\\nPlease for the sake of everybody rian\\, cancel your spinoff trilogy and stay as far away from movies as possible","true":true}
