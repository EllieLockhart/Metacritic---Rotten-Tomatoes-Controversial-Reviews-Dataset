Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While rather good in general\\, a lot of pointless small characters take away our attention of the big story\\, sometimes killing the mood. The Force is treated as something it's not originally. Great acting mostly but too many bugs in the science and the action scenes. The CGI is breathtaking but was expected to be. To sum up: this movie didn't bring anything new and both the big bad guy and the big nice guy died... in an none epic way... which was lame to say the least...","true":true}
