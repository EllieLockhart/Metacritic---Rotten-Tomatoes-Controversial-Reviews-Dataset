Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anti-climactic. Hollow characters. Threw out all of the potential that Abrams created in The Force Awakens. Had no concept of the Force\\, or even gravity for that matter. Horribly placed jokes that took you out of the movie. As a Star Wars fan\\, I am DISAPPOINTED","true":true}
