Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this movie. It didn't stick to the original storyline of Jedi master and Apprentice. I like that because it sets the stage for Rey to be a unique Jedi who struggles finding out how to use the force. Which will make her successes more satisfying. I also thought the evolution of Kylo as a psychopath was excellent. I even liked the detour of the movie that many criticize. I think the only valid criticism of the movie was pacing & overabundance of jokes. Overall\\, it's a great addition to the Star Wars family.","true":true}
