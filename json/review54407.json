Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I knew when i came out of the last jedi\\, that the reviews would be split. Because I was myself. I hated half of the movie\\, as I loved the other half.\\n\\nMan I use to love Finn\\, but damn in tht movie they made him and the new character\\, Rose\\, unberable. It is Finn and Rose comedy show. Terrible.\\n\\nThe story in itself is original. I was afraid that it would be a copy\/paste of episode 5\\, but surprisely\\, if they took some idea\\, it was original enough. Luke scenes in the story of EA Battlefront 2 where better.  \\n\\nOther thing\\, one word\\, Disney. So many childrens stuffs\\, I am very disapointed\\, more even after Rogue One that was very adult in his presentation\\, and very better in his form.\\n\\nSome great scenes\\, many plot twist\\, high risk in the storytelling.\\nTo much jokes\\,sometimes it broke the emotion. Some plot holes too.\\n\\nIt was not the movie that was promised in the trailers\\, it was entirely another stuff. \\n\\nA very bad intro. \\nBut a great depiction of the force. \\n\\nIf they do not fix the bad stuff in there next movie\\, I will never go see some Disney Star Wars again.","true":true}
