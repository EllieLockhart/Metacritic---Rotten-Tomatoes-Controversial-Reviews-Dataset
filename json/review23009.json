Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of social justice bullshit\\, I\u00b4m sick of it\\, This crap is like a disease spreading all over the industry.","true":true}
