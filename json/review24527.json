Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most people's complaints were frankly quite odd. They complained about Leia using the force (when she is\\, in fact\\, quite good with the force in canon and even becomes an actual jedi in the books) or about the connection between Kylo and Rey (another canon thing - a force bond.)\\n\\nLike... sure\\, there a few scenes that were weird\\, some plot holes. and some unnecessary moments\\, but it was pretty damn good overall.\\n\\nBold and innovative.","true":true}
