Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited for this movie; unfortunately\\, it was incredibly disappointing. Abrams was brilliant at creating a film that was yes\\, a recreation of the first film\\, but a recreation that was dare I say\\, better than the first. The characters were well developed\\, the writing was smart\\, serious yet still maintained the youthful humor of the original three. This movie was the opposite. I almost thought Lucas came back to write & direct this movie (this is NOT a complement...I am referring to his 3 horrific prequel films). Why did Rey go to the island? She did & learned absolutely nothing. The writing was terrible and the preaching was in your face. There were some good ideas that were never fully realized. The movie ends with no reason to care if there is a third. All of the interesting characters are dead. It\u2019s unfortunate Abrams didn\u2019t take on the whole series; he bares some of the responsibility of this tragedy as an executive producer. ","true":true}
