Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've left every Star Wars Movie feeling a sense of awe & exhileration-until The Last Jedi. Just had no emotional attachment to the story at all. Unless you count boredom & irritation. Keeping Finn and Rey apart the entire movie-he IS the only character that brings the charm-and saddling her w Gloomy Gus Luke didn't add wto the movie. And way too many convenient fortuitous moments that felt cringeworthy-Leia awakening from her coma in the nick of time\\, Yoda appearing\\, etc.","true":true}
