Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible.a half star is actually too much. 70+ plot holes..completely ignores the outline the force awakens sets up. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy pushes the sjw narratives in this movie\\,that's supposed to be in a galaxy far\\,far away..","true":true}
