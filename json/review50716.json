Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A 152 minute long low speed chase (literally) culminating in nothing spectacular\\, mediocre\\, or even slightly interesting.  With a rating of 93% fresh\\, I can only conclude all the professional movie critics have been bribed.","true":true}
