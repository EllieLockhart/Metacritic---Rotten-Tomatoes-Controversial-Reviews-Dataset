Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this movie didnt live up to expectations I still enjoyed the movie. I think at times people are being a bit harsh here and there with what they consider to be 'plot holes' it stil doesn't deserve all the negativity. I do share some of the negative reviews it didn't ruin the movie for me or the entire franchise as some have gone as far to say.","true":true}
