{"101487":170757,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Strengths: The relationship between Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) was intriguing in The Force Awakens. In The Last Jedi\\, it gets taken to the next level and steals the show. Their connected scenes were fantastic. It really shone a light on their similarities and differences. In fact\\, Ren was my favorite character to watch this time around. His inner struggle is gripping. The scenes he has with Luke (Mark Hamill) and a tense one with Leia (Carrie Fisher) were also great. Rey and Ren were involved in what was probably my second favorite lightsaber battle in the history of the series. Rey and Luke also had some stellar scenes together. I liked what they did with Snoke (Andy Serkis)\\, because I wasn't a big fan of the character. They did a strong job introducing Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)\\, while Poe (Oscar Isaac) got one of the better of the film. Finn (John Boyega) getting his own story was a cool idea\\, as was his battle with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). I loved the fact that Fisher was given great stuff to work with and did a lot more this time around\\, especially given it being her last film. Lastly\\, Rian Johnson was a great choice for director. \\n\\nWeaknesses: At 152 minutes\\, this is the longest film in the Star Wars saga and it feels that way at some points. I wanted to see more of Rey training with Luke and was disappointed we didn't get more. I enjoyed the addition of Rose\\, I didn't care much for Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). She's a good actress and the story worked okay for Poe\\, but her going from ready to shoot Poe to saying she liked him felt strange. Also\\, though I thought Rose was brought in well\\, they might've spent a bit too much with her\\, Finn and DJ (Benicio Del Toro).\\n\\nOverall: I thought The Force Awakens was better and I can see some of the issues with this episode\\, but it's mostly great. The action scenes are glorious\\, everything looks beautiful and most of the cast deliver strong performances. There are a few issues with the script and some disappointing things\\, so I understand some of the divisive reviews. However\\, I thought it was the fourth best episode (behind V\\, VII and IV).","true":true}
