Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They blew it with Luke Skywalker.  The writer(s) seemed to know nothing about being a jedi and made Luke out to be a...wheenie.  It just wasn't right.  It didn't work at all.  Not to mention that this film was too long.  There can be long films in a good way but this film had a bunch of stuff going on that you just didn't care about.  When you check your phone four or five times during a film to see just how much of this crap you have left to watch\\, something is wrong!  Thanks a lot\\, Disney!  You truly screwed the fans out of what could have been a great movie experience.","true":true}
