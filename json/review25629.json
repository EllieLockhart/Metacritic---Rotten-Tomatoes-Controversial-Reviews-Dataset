Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a horrible movie\\, however\\, the action and flow of the movie was kind of all over the place and not in tuned with traditional Star Wars spirit. The story was okay\\, not too bad and slightly predictable. Just flat out going to say the movie was not that good\\, it will be forgettable. Even more forgettable than the one with Jar Jar. The logic for some parts of the movie was kind of \u201cehhh\\, why didn\u2019t they think of this before?\u201d Type or hind sight 20\/20 thought. Not the best of the series of course. I have watched all of the Star Wars episodes but I\u2019m not a what you may consider hard core Star Wars fan. Not sure what they have in store for the final episode in this trilogy so we shall wait and see. ","true":true}
