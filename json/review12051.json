Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually liked it better than the force awakens because it was at least an original story (although Rey undergoes the most half assed Jedi training ever). My biggest pet peeve was when Leia went flying out of the command bridge into space and they magically gave her force powers and the ability to breathe outside. Carrie Fishers acting was distracting because her nose was so stuffy from all the Coke she's been doing.","true":true}
