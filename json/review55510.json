Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My original 1 star review wasn't posted. I'm not bothered typing it again in it's entirety but some lowlights of this abomination included\\, but are by no means limited to:\\n\\n- The demise of the resistance since the previous movie which takes place about a week\/days before\\n- A person with no training besting one of the greatest jedis of all time\\n- Dropping bombs in space (lul) \\n- Destruction of a possible Snoke story\\n-Destruciton of Rey's lineage story \\n- Pathetic death of Snoke\\n- Pathetic death of Luke\\n-Character annihilation of Luke\\n- Force diversity castings - absolutely fine if it's organic and has purpose. It was quite deliberate here. \\n- Obvious feminist messages\\n-Obvious SJW agenda in a fictional Universe which should be apolitical\\n- Deliberate casting of caucasian males as the \\\"bad guys\\\" \\n\\nI'm too angry now\\, what a waste of time and dissappointment this movie was. \\n\\nRT and \/ or critics have definitely lost credibility with their raving reviews of this movie. Did we see the same thing? I'm a layman with no specific movie knowledge more than the next person who likes movies. These guys are the \\\"experts\\\"....WTF? They must be on the sauce.","true":true}
