Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is no longer a space opera.\\nAt least JJ Abraham's was decent\\, still not excellent. But this one is just wrong in so many levels. I hate you Disney.\\n\\nMess of a plot. Super forced jokes. Forced love just like GoT's Jon Snow and Draenerys. Unacceptable First Order VS alliance space 'battle'. Unlogical speed. Leia's force use is just dull and dumb\\, 70s movie had much better effect.\\n\\nEvery other movie was more targeted to a more mature audience. This one targets newborns.","true":true}
