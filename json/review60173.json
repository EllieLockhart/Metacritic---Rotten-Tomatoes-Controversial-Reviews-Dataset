In short:\rStory - 1\/4 - The story is not only very much not enjoyable\\, but also poorly put together. Lots of random flashbacks\\, the characters aren't developed properly and the player has no choice whatsoever in the outcome of the game. Everything is scripted. Story weights 4 points for me because it should be the selling point of the game\\, but it was actually so shallow and dislikeable that i seriously can't find almost anything good in it. Only a couple of characters are actually well written and developed. The rest kinda makes you not even want to finish the game.\rLongevity - 0\/2 - The single player story is something i'd never want to go through again\\, and compared to the first game there is no multiplayer. 25 hours at best\\, at least for me.\rGraphics and Audio - 2\/2 - Not much to say here. The game is visually stunning.\rGameplay - 1\/2 - Basically the same gameplay from the first game\\, nothing wrong with it\\, but they could have made it a bit more interesting.\r\rTotal: 4\/10\rWhat's funny is that they critics are blaming the low user-score on the players\\, refusing to acknowledge anything wrong with the actual game. Anyone giving this game a 10\/10 is clueless.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
