Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do not understand why people do not like this movie. There was only a few small moments were I thought it could have been better\\, but I overall really enjoy the film. Any person that said they didn\u2019t like it is probably some fan fiction writer who was upset the movie didn\u2019t do what he expected it to do and anyone who said they are a huge Star Wars fan but won\u2019t watch episode 9 because of this movie isn\u2019t a real fan.","true":true}
