Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"News just leaked from the studios: in the next movie the Porgs will have Force powers.\\nOf course they will not need any training in it before using it proficiently. It's so trendy!\\nThe Porgs have been chosen to represent the new Jedis because they do not have different genders\\, different skin colors\\, different sexual orientations. \\nSome of them will have purple hair\\, though\\, just because it is a must nowadays.\\nThey will drive Star Wars in a new\\, exceedingly bold (I don't give a fuck!)\\, extremely refreshing (brrrrr!) and utterly surprising (woahhh!) direction: \\nright into the garbage can.","true":true}
