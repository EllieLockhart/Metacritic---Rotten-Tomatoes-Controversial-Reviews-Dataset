{"101487":184298,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-03","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a huge disappointment. For the first half an hour or so I considered it a 2\/10 - completely irredeemable. On the other hand\\, Rey\/Luke\/Ren's plot and arc was generally great\\, a good 8\/10 for me (plot holes\\, wasted opportunities and bad characterisation choices aside). However\\, the rest of the movie continued to stumble on dreadfully\\, with only a few saving graces. Overall\\, it's a 4\/10 for me\\, half great\\, half dreadful. What was wrong? Firstly the awful tone contrasts - it suffers from Marvel quips and ridiculous \\\"comedy\\\" sequences in a way that not only feels completely out of place in a Star Wars movie (the originals had humour\\, not gags and quips\\, and the less said about the prequel humour the better)\\, but also don't fit the tone from second to second. Poignant moments are completely ruined by quips and gags\\, and the movie richochets around like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Secondly\\, the plot(s) and characters. Plot holes\\, pointless plots that go nowhere or elements and characters that are shoehorned in but make no sense\\, whilst other characters are wasted. Politics has been furiously debated back and forth by viewers and critics. Proponents of the film would like to believe that people are only criticising the film because people who don't like it \\\"hate women\\\" or are \\\"manchildren\\\" or whatever else. Rian included - this allows him to protect his ego from genuine complaints and criticisms that he doesn't seem to be able to deal with. My problem isn't with the politics per se. Strong female characters are great\\, subversion of expectations is fine\\, etc etc. If it fits with the narrative. The problem here is that Rian\\, Kathleen\\, and I'm sure other people at Disney have forced politics in at the expense of the narrative and characters. Rey is generally a one-dimensional mary-sue. Rose and Holdo were one-dimensional poorly shoehorned agendas. Canto Beight was dreadful\\, and pointless. We get it - animal cruelty is bad\\, slavery is bad. But it's not just about politics - Maz's appearance was ridiculous\\, Phasma was completely wasted again. Why didn't Ackbar or Leia take on Holdo's role?  I think that one of the problems is that Star Wars has always been about heart. Lucas had his strengths but clearly wasn't always the best filmmaker\\, and needed people to rein him in - we have seen the consequences when this does and doesn't happen. But he loved Star Wars\\, it was in his heart. The best expanded universe material (now slashed by Disney) was made by people who loved Star Wars\\, who knew the characters\\, knew the mythology\\, lived and breathed it. Kathleen has spoken about Star Wars being \\\"like any other major franchise\\\" (paraphrasing) and it is clear that Disney\\, Kathleen and LFL view Star Wars in that way. A franchise. A label. Reading interviews with Rian it is clear that he didn't know anything really about Star Wars. He wanted to wrap it around a story and an agenda that he wanted to present\\, rather than telling a story that fits within the established universe - the reason that fans have been buying books\\, comics\\, games\\, movies\\, all these years\\, supporting Star Wars all this time. Rogue One (despite its flaws) was exception\\, a Star Wars movie that respected the Universe. The Force Awakens also did\\, to an extent (let's not get started). But the Last Jedi feels like a middle finger to Star Wars itself\\, and then people can't understand why the film has a 48% audience score. I should also say here that my personal experience has been that non-fans have found most of the same problems as fans (tone\\, secondary plots and plot holes\\, characters)\\, so this isn't an \\\"us versus them\\\" with respect to fans and casual viewers. I just hope that despite the echo chamber that Rian and Kathleen seem to be living in\\, Disney recognise that actually the public as a whole have spoken\\, by the box office take (which was initially high based on TFA but dropped drastically as word of mouth spread)\\, by the audience scores\\, by merchandise sales etc\\, that this is not the direction star wars should be going in\\, and they should get rid of Kathleen and Rian as soon as possible if they don't want to drive one of the most beloved settings (not to mention a 4billion dollar franchise) into the ground within a few years. Not only was this a waste of half of a main line Star Wars movie\\, but it is also arguably a waste of the whole trilogy and one third of the whole Star Wars cinematic universe. Why on Earth the decision was made for JJ to direct TFA\\, then for Rian to defecate all over JJ's work\\, only for JJ to pick it up again at the end is boggling. There has clearly been no overall direction to the trilogy\\, the end of the second movie is basically no further alone than at the end of the previous movie\\, except that major beloved characters (and potentially interesting new characters such as Snoke) are now dead. Well done Rian. What a waste.","true":true}
