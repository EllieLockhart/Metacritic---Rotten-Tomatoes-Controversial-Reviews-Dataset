Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to write this review. As a long time time Star Wars fan\\, this movie was a total disappointment. The critics were wrong\\, it\u2019s a rip off of ESB\/ROTJ and what a joke General Hux is as a character. Storyline was choppy and all over the place. This movie made a joke of the whole franchise. Don\u2019t waste your money this is movie total waste of time. I can\u2019t believe I waited 2 years to see this movie! (((Puke)))","true":true}
