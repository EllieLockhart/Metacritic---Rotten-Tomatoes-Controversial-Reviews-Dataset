Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In May of 1977\\, after seeing Wars\\, I walked on a Saturday morning to my local theatre\\, I paid for a ticket\\, and I watched every Star Wars until the theatre closed at 10pm. Since Return of the Jedi I have waited 30+ years to see my hero Luke Skywalker. \\n\\nLet me get this straight. Instead of showing our hero restoring the Jedi order or perhaps dying in a lightsable blaze of glory\\, your idea of returning the childhood hero to millions in to depict him milking a space alien with oversized titties\\, and then inexplicably vanishing into the sunset. \\n\\nAnd can someone please explain the relevance of the no-shirt scene? \\nWas Kylo-Ren just raped or involved in some alien orgy? Thank God I didn't watch this in my own house...I would have baseball-batted my own television like my other childhood hero Reggie Jackson. \\n\\nPlease cancel episode 9 immediately and remake this movie before the cast gets too old.","true":true}
