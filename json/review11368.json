Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible desarrollo de historia\\, una nave que no puede ser alcanzada... Un Luke cobarde\\, en el planeta Crait una batalla que no es batalla\\, no\\, nada bueno.","true":false}
