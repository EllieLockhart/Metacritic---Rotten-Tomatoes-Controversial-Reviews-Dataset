Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a long time SW fan\\, love TFA and R1. Was so excited for this movie felt like Xmas going to the cinema to watch this. I remember leaving feeling empty\\, kind of in shock and tried to justify it\\, after the second viewing I genuinely hate this movie. It's not just this movie but the direction Lucasfilm is going with Kennedy at the top\\, we need a SW fan running things not someone who is going to push a political agenda on everyone. Kennedy is incompetent look at all the directors she has fired for example. I'm not giving Disney anymore money until they sort this mess at the top of Lucasfilm out and put someone in charge who cares about the franchise and all the fans. FYI I'm not a bot or Russian","true":true}
