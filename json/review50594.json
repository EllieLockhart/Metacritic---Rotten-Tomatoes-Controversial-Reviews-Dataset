Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"33 years old. Loved Star Wars since I was a child.\\nThis movie killed any excitement for the franchise moving forward.\\n\\nNot an ounce of hype for #IX or the Han Solo films.\\n\\nThis film annoys me more as Carrie is now gone and this trilogy was the only opportunity to create a worthwhile continuation to the franchise.","true":true}
