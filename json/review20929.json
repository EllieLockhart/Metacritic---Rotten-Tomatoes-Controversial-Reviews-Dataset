Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was entertained the entire film. However\\, it leaves too many unanswered questions when as Star Wars fans we should be getting answers to the questions. I thought I knew how the force worked but now I have no idea. Kylo Ren is all powerful darkside but yet struggles fighting Rey who is not trained in the force but yet he can take out some powerful people without them sensing what is happening?","true":true}
