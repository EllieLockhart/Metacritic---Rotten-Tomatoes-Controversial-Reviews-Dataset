Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes bold twists and turns and features fantastic character development. Although the movie is in many ways strikingly different than its predecessors\\, Rian Johnson has created a gorgeous film that explores elements of the Star Wars universe in new and exciting ways. Fans should not expect a rehash of the Original Trilogy. Despite my high expectations\\, I was not let down. Johnson's take on Star Wars is truley unique and impressive.","true":true}
