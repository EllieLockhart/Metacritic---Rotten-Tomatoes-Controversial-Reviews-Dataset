Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie seems to a disconjointed mess\\, like the editor never even saw the prior ones. Combine that with the too obvious one liners and demonization of the old characters and it makes a horrible sequel to the last movie. For the love of cupcakes why must every fight in a large open areas does the republic land so far away from the base\\, have the ability to jump systems but not land close. Too much cgi\\, too little chemistry and weird fight scenes and this may be the last jedi I will bother seeing. Thanks disney for ruining a childhood movie series.","true":true}
