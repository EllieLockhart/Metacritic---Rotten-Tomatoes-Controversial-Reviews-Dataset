Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fan-fricken-tastic. Loved it. Visually stunning and very very well done. I was privledged enough to see the original trilogy as a child (I snuck into Empire with my older brother) so I've been a long time fan. Except for Episode I\\, when watched back to back to back... which I did the week before this release\\, the franchise paints a fantastic saga. I have no idea why fans are disrespecting this installment.","true":true}
