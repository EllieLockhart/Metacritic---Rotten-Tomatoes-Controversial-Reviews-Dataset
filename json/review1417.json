Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard Star Wars fan I was extremely disappointed at what was produced. It is a blatant and almost disrespectful departure from the Star Wars mythos. The treatment of Luke Skywalker was completely unnecessary and felt very forced. As if Rian Johnson wanted to be different just for the sake of being different. Way to alienate the fanbase.","true":true}
