Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Breaking Bad's Rian Johnson did it. Emotional depth\\, character development\\, NEW IDEAS\\, and nuance. This movie is undoubtedly the best in the Star Wars Franchise. Upon viewing the film\\, I turned to my friend sitting next to me and said \\\"a lot of passionate fans will not like this.\\\" He takes people's expectations and theories\\, and throws it against the wall. He manages to not only make fun of the Star Wars franchise and point to it's many flaws\\, but also venerates it. What you get is a rebirth of the franchise. A reminder that sometimes fans halt innovation with our whining and wanting everything to be the same. Art must die and be reborn. In the word's of Luke \\\"this is not going to go the way you think.\\\"  Rian Johnson was brave enough to\\, in the words of Kylo Ren\\, \\\"let the past die.\\\" Johnson makes a wonderful satire of the whole Star Wars franchise in a respectful way.He makes the film his own\\, like any other artist in any other medium should. Years from now the angry fans will subside and everyone will recognize this film for what it is: masterclass.","true":true}
