Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a convoluted shamble of a movie. There\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)re so many things wrong with it\\, it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s hard to know where to begin. Worst movie I\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)ve ever seen.","true":true}
