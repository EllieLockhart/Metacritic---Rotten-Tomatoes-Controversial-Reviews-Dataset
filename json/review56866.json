Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is so much wrong with this movie I couldn't possibly cover it in a review. In short the movie has a blatant political agenda\\, tosses aside everything set up in the previous movie\\, takes a dump on the legacy of the original trilogy\\, has plot holes so large you could fit a star destroyer through them and has a whole middle section and story that serves absolutely no purpose. Subversion of expectations does not make a movie good\\, indeed subversion for the sake of subversion is actually really bad story telling. The critics that praised this film are bought for and paid off by Disney of that I have no doubt. Oh but on the positive side the action is intense and the effects are sleek. Were this presented as merely a popcorn movie where you shut your brain off to view it perhaps it would be passable\\, but according to the critics this is an all time masterpiece. Lol. Critics.","true":true}
