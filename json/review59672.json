Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Last of us 2 Review:I needed around 24 hours for a normal playthrough with 184 collectables found. This game is something special\\, positive and negative. Positives first: Big step up in gameplay in comparison to the first game\\, amazing sound design and soundtrack\\, amazing level design(the places feel like real places and not combat areas)\\, the groundbreaking animations and the amazing acting\\, especially by Troy Baker\\, Ashley Johnson and Laura Bailey. These aspects are better than Tlou in every scene and level. They set new industrial standards. Negative aspects:The difference between story\/theme and gameplay. The moral of the story is that revenge is bad and the killing of innocent people isn't worth it\\, but the gameplay has a different opinion about it\\, it forces you to kill a lot of enemies in the most brutal way\\, if you want or not. You can't progress without killing at least 80% of all enemies in a area. I only finished one level without killing everyone\\, and I tried to save as many lifes as possible. It's a contradiction between story and gameplay in a way i have never seen it\\, it destroys the theme of the game. The handling of a lot of characters is also disappointing because 1. they have no character development and 2. they behave like different people. Part 1 and part 2 has the same characters but they have different personalities. You play half the game as a different character than Ellie and these segments are strange. You play them after playing them with Ellie but earlier in the timeline. These level are too long\\, specially because you start from the beginning where you have to work yourself back to the climax. The three in game days are interesting but the story is stretched and feels like they want to hold you back. If you don't like the character you are playing these segments feel really long (I almost quit the game for that reason\\, it felt like work to progress and not like fun). If the chapters where like Seattle day 1\\, day 1\\, day 2\\, day 2\\, day 3 and day 3 it would feel better to play because you work with both characters on the climax and not like one finished her arc and the other starts hers after that.Verdict:The last of us part 2 is an amazing game in terms of animation\\, Gameplay\\, acting and sound design but the story stops the game from being a masterpiece like its predecessor. If i would include the horrible working conditions and leak handling\\, the game would rank lower. What has been achieved\\, a higher technical bar in the industry was paid by the health of the worker at naughty dog. Was it worth it?Any questions left write me on Twitter @descole_luca\u2026 Expand","true":true}
