Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The last Jedi\\\" may not quite be like some of the fans expected but no one can't deny it's an incredible shot film\\, full of action scenes and filled with amazing special effects. \\n\\nA movie faithful to its legacy and with enough tweaks and character development to take the beloved saga to new horizons.","true":true}
