Once you know the story\\, there are no more surprises for next time around. That's not a bad thing on the whole - often with re-plays you already know the story. But the problem with Until Dawn is that you *expect* a different story given the 'Butterfly Effect' system. You even expect your interactions with other characters to change the story - but they don't. (There are certain stat bars for how you have interacted with the others\\, but whether you get along well with someone\\, or not well at all - nothing seems to change within the story).\r\rThe 'Butterfly Effect' system is used to change how the story pans out. And it doesn't. Well\\, it does. Kind of. People can live or die depending on the choices you make\\, but this will not necessarily impact the way that your game will follow through and end. That\\, in itself\\, is disappointing.\r\rThese points aside\\, Until Dawn was a very enjoyable game on my first play through. With plot twists\\, I never knew what was next. The game kept me on the edge of my seat constantly and I couldn't stop playing - I just had to know what was going to happen next!\r\rThe graphics are superb and the sounds are chilling. The story was enjoyable and\\, at some points\\, unexpected.\r\rDespite my review score\\, I would definitely recommend playing through Until Dawn\\, however don't expect anything dramatically different if you decide to play through it again for a second time. It's a game every PS4 owner should try at some point.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
