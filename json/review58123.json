Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie to  date!!! While the music\\, acting and visual effects were top notch\\, there were many thing wrong with this movie. First off the pacing was off; it was hard staying in the moment when they would throw you all over the place. Second the story was not that interesting which made the characters not interesting. Third\\, I'm all for reinventing the wheel or going in a new direction but the this didn't feel like a Star Wars movie with the choices in direction that the director made. And speaking of direction i'm not sure I am a fan of the direction of the franchise. In the end\\, I would recommend you see the movie for yourself as I know people that loved the movie. Its just not for me.","true":true}
