Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I confess I am not a hardcore Star Wars fan so maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. In my opinion\\, it had all the elements a Star Wars movie needs: action fight scenes\\, feel-good takeaway\\, nostalgic music\\, and overall epicness. This saga is a fairly straightforward journey so best not to take it too seriously!","true":true}
