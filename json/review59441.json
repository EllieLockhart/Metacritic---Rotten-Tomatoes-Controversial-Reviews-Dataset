The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is just incredible. People are angry and mad because of Joel's death and Ellie forgiving Abby at the last moment\\, also due to LGTB references. This is simply stupid!\r\rEveryone has to understand that Joel isn't a hero. We missed him definitely\\, but in a post-apocalyptic universe\\, life depends only on survival and is unpredictable. ND achieved to mess up with our minds\\, to think in a different way\\, to feel what other people are living\\, and that's great.\r\rThe game tries to tell us that revenge is a path to nowhere. Abby killed Joel\\, and what did she gain? Ellie killing all her friends. If Abby killed Ellie\\, she would have lost Lev\\, the only one left in her life.  Ellie tried to kill Abby\\, and what did she gain? Nothing. She lost everything: her family\\, her friends\\, her knife\\, her fingers\\, and the ability to play the guitar which was the last gift and memory of Joel. That's what you get for taking that way.\rDid Ellie forgive Abby only with a sudden flashback? Yes\\, because she remembered her last moment with Joel when she tried to forgive him after two years because he lied to her and ignored her consent in the matter. If she could forgive Joel\\, why wouldn't she spare Abby? At that moment\\, she had already lost everything\\, and killing Abby wouldn't be the solution\\, because she'd have gained Lev to go against her and look for her death\\, and this nonsense circle continues...\r\rThe storyline of this game is amazing\\, it makes us think differently in the way life treats us. They want us to sympathize with different characters along with the game\\, and they do. LGTB characters make no damage to the story at all. They just try to make us understand that being a lesbian\\, trans\\, or whatever in that kind of world is meaningless. SURVIVAL is key\\, and anything else matters.\r\rPerhaps\\, people were expecting to play as Joel\\, but if you saw the trailers\\, it was obvious that Ellie was going to be the protagonist and any other event\\, besides Joel's death\\, wouldn't have developed the revenge feeling which was the main topic in the story.\r\rI respect your opinion if you didn't like it\\, but at least you can't deny all the excellent work and time this studio dedicated to the creation of this game. Graphics are incredible\\, every little detail is astonishing\\, gameplay mode is better than the previous game\\, etc. Of course\\, TLOU is better than TLOU2 in many different aspects\\, but we can't let this masterpiece behind.\r\rSorry for the disappointed fans.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
