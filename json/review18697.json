Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I truly wanted to like this movie but couldn't stand it. Hyped it to everyone before leaving work for the weekend and then had to apologize on Monday for misleading those who'd never seen a SW film. Basically it felt as if The Last Jedi was made by a boardroom rather than a single director. Half the characters were wasted and a huge chunk of the story was a pointless meandering to explain nothing. Rey's story is great\\, Finn has some good moments\\, but the audience critiques were correct; plot holes\\, goofy jokes\\, lackluster characterizations and\\, in the end\\, I can't even explain what the plot was because there were three plots that never connected or found their own meaning. Maybe this will be a fine set up for the next film\\, but I was shocked by how little love went into this. No judgement on those who liked it\\, for me it strayed from the model presented by the first three SW films and The Force Awakens and it was the \\\"feel\\\" that I truly wanted and never received.","true":true}
