Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should be called: How To Ruin Star Wars\\n\\nAwful writing. Bad directing. So many cringe moments in this movie. They make the Star Wars world look lame in this motion picture. As a long time fan\\, I feel this isn't a Star Wars movie but more like a Disney theme park promo.","true":true}
