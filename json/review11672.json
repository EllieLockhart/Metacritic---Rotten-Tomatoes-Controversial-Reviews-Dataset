Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hot Garbage! Managed to ruin my last hope for Disney Star Wars production. A total Moron could bring a more satisfying movie together. Luke was decimated and sent off in the stupidest way. Count me out for epidote 9\\, I will watch when I can find it for free\\, I won't give my money to Disney and affirm their betrayal of fans","true":true}
