Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolute garbage. It completely betrays the canon of Star Wars from previous movies\\, is an incoherent mess and is not even in line with the immediate previous movie The Force Awakens\\, it just tosses away all the story plots set in TFA \\, explaining nothing\\, the TLJ story (if it can be called that way) goes nowhere\\, with pointless characters such as Rose and DJ. All that Montecarlo-like space casino sequence could have been completely removed from the movie\\, it adds nothing to the story and served just to push the Disney PC and SWJ political agenda down the audience's throats shamelessly. And the way and iconic cultural hero such as Luke Skywalker is disrespected by Rian Johnson's awful excuse of a script\\, is a blasphemy. Rian Johnson should stay away from Star Wars forever\\, and Kathleen Kennedy should be fired \\, seems she doesn't have a clue on how to run Lucasfilm\\, as she has NO BALLS to defend the legacy of George Lucas. Kathleen\\, you're a disgrace and the worst decision Lucas made was to put you in charge of Lucasfilm\\, you're simply clueless!. Disney has made the idotic decision of alienating the SW fanbase who saw the classic films by ruining Luke Skywalker character like that\\, who do you think has the purchasing power to buy tickets and toys?\\, yes that classic SW fanbase\\, not the easily impressionable kids you made this movie for\\, they don't have money to buy tickets and toys\\, their fan parents do and you alienate them with this horrible movie. Business-wise\\, is very idiotic from Disney part to do that.","true":true}
