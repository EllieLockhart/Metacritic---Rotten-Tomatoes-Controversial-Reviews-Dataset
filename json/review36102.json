Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a good movie\\, but not all that I was hoping for. After being disappointed with Rogue One\\, I had high hopes for The Last Jedi. Almost all of the original characters have died off\\, and the plot is completely different. The Jedi doesn't exist anymore either. Star Wars has gotten considerable worse since the prequels came out. But\\, I have to give credit where due: The movie had a good soundtrack\\, effects\\, and a good plotline in itself. If it wasn't supposed to be a continuation of the original Star Wars\\, I'd rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately\\, it is and it must be realized the original story is dying.","true":true}
