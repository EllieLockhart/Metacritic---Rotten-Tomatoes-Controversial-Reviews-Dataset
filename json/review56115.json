Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So try not to spoil anything. There are several things that annoy me and a few things that taints this movie for me. Starting off with the things I can accept but not like; are the Disney influence which include forced scenes that are obvious geared to see posters\\, overly cute animals that are designed to be sold to children\\, Jokes every other scene\\, Dark scenes where you cannot see anything but the characters look of awe on their face\\, infinite questions with no answers. Now with these things it still could have been a successful Star wars movie but with the next ones really weakens the movie. Things that could not possible happen like person A in a ship going as fast as he can in a ship and person B banks off somehow gets to the spot before the other person. That Is not the worst one but the easiest one to not spoil anything\\, The plot was not a star wars plot and the feel was completely off\\, the decided to throw out deep stories and make the back story shallow for characters in order to keep them out of  the spot light or not minding if they die and then they bank on us caring about things we don't. The most unforgivable is what they have done with Luke. Be prepared to be disappointed every time you see him on screen.","true":true}
