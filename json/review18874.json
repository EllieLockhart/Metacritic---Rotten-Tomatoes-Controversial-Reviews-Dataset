Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a pretty film\\, The main story doesn't make sense\\, neither do any of the sub plots. Major plot holes and an over reliance on coincidence\\, occasionally absurd. Male characters have bee neutered for no apparent reason. The Force is inconsistent\\, masters are novices and vice versa. Previous set ups in story lines all cast aside. Meh.","true":true}
