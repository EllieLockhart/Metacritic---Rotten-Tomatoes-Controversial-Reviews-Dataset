Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed with a few small details (and one big one) but while I didn't like the \\\"out with the old\\, in with the new and young\\\" theme throughout\\, there were so many other things I absolutely loved\\, and I was thrilled to see it didn't go in the direction the confusing trailers initially showed. Humor and action were amped up\\, and I can't wait to see what happens next!","true":true}
