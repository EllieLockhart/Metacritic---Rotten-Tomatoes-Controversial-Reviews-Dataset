Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don't understand all the hate for this movie. It did have a little misplaced humor that didn't feel right\\, but overall I thought the movie was pretty good. Can't wait for the next installment!","true":true}
