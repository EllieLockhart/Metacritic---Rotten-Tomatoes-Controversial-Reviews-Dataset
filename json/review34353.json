Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The atmosphere and setting is incredibly vibrant and rings Star Wars. The cinematography and jokes are on point.\\n\\nThough overall the issue with the newest Star Wars in my opinion is a complete lack of substance. The story feels empty and void of content. I feel coming out of it there wasn't much storytelling and was more driven to action and humor the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy.","true":true}
