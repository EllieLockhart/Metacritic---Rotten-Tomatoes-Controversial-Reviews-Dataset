Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bafflingly bad. This film took everything about the first film that had any promise and destroyed it. And it did so with a toxic mix of self-righteous glee and appallingly bad execution. \\n\\nOne INTERESTING\\, though I'm almost certain accidental\\, feature of the film is that Luke's treatment of Rey is a microcosm of the movie's treatment of its audience. Luke heaps mocking scorn on Rey's ambitions\\, those same ambitions that the audience was led to believe would drive this new trilogy. Thus the film belittles the audience itself - \\\"Oh\\, you thought this story would develop the plot lines and themes introduced in the first film? You thought we might answer a few questions and create larger ones? Like a second movie in a trilogy ought to do? You're just a simple-minded child like Rey\\, who doesn't understand how thing work these days.\\\" \\n\\nAnd yet I do no think that this disrespect of the audience was intentional. I think it was done out of sheer incompetence\\, which almost makes it worse. Johnson thought that he was taking Star Wars in an exciting new direction by challenging audience expectations and shattering dusty old tropes. He thought he was breathing life into an old franchise\\, in a way that \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" had not done. However\\, there is a difference between an \\\"exciting new take\\\" on an old franchise\\, and destroying the franchise because you don't understand what is and isn't vital to its greatness. \\n\\nThis film would be like if Netflix suddenly dropped a new season of \\\"Friends\\,\\\" and Chandler and Rachel were murdered by terrorists in the first episode. Its a bold new take! Yeah\\, but it also completely changes the nature of the story\\, ruins classic old characters\\, and shatters the audience's interest. \\n\\nTo top it off\\, and I'm not going to get into this in detail\\, the \\\"new direction\\\" storyline was not even executed well. To stick with the \\\"Friends\\\" analogy\\, it would be like if after Chandler and Rachel die\\, the rest of the season focuses mostly on Phoebe shopping for dining room tables\\, and then in the last episode everyone suddenly meets up and declares that they are still friends. \\n\\nJust terrible. Grand ambitions in completely misguided directions\\, and shocking incompetence in execution.","true":true}
