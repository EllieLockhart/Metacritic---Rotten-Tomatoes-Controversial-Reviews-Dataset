Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did what most film makers would never dream of doing\\, he took risks. It sure did pay off too. The Last Jedi is a wonderful ride full of many unexpected turns and it leaves you satisfied\\, but just enough that you crave the final chapter in the sequel trilogy and can't wait to see how the stories of Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe conclude.","true":true}
