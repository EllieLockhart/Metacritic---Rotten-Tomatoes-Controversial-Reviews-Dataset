Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This sorry excuse for a film has done nothing but tarnish this once great franchise. If you thought the prequels were bad\\, you ain't seen nothing yet. Not only does this abomination completely defecate all over Luke's character\\, but he does literally nothing but die. This is absolutely disgraceful. Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. Dead Serious.","true":true}
