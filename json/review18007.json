Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the critics are overrating this film\\, I just dont like it sad to say. It didn't have the Star Wars feel and if that's because of Disney I dont know. Ep 1-2 are good compared to this.","true":true}
