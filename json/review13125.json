Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know where to start. The movie was boring\\, unnecessarily long\\, incoherent\\, it has gigantic plot holes\\, dull characters\\, forced chemistry\/interactions between them\\, it lost continuity with many things established in the previous film. Its a complete mess.\\n\\nIf you are not a star wars fan\\, you will walk out of the theater simply thinking that you just saw a bad movie\\, but if you are a fan \\, you will walk away disappointing  and will pretty much hate it.","true":true}
