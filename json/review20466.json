Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been an avid fan of Star Wars since I was little. Grew up in the 90's watching the original trilogy over and over again\\, reading every book I could get my hands. Episode 7 was meh. It wasn't bad\\, but a little disappointing. Was hoping The Last Jedi would save it\\, but it only made it worse. I've never seen a movie with so many plot holes and bad jokes. Coupled with the bad joke that is the entire storyline of this movie I wish I hadn't gone. Feeding the money hungry machine that is Disney. Felt like a movie that was made for the sole purpose of making money with no effort given to it and no thought of the fans that have loved Star Wars for so many years. I mean we had to ride through episodes 1\\,2\\, and 3. Now this?? Heck the lightsaber fights in 3 were better action than is in this movie. Don't go. Don't feed the money hungry Disney machine\\, and if you didn't enjoy it please at least add a rating so other people can see. Sorry for the rant. Low key very triggered.","true":true}
