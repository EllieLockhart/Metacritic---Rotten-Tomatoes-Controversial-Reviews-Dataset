Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most dissappointing\\, anti-climatic\\, inconsistent\\, and poorly written film I have ever seen; barr none! NEGATIVE 5 star rating! Disney and Rian Johnson manage to destroy the Star Wars franchise. This movie is complete garbage. The 92% rating is bought and paid for by Disney. Anyone who likes this movie is easily distracted by shiny things.Everything set up in The Force Awakens that had me interested in seeing this movie was thrown in the toilet. The Luke Skywalker they portrayed isn't even the same character\\, aparently Rian Jones isn't as big of a fan as he claims. It's like depicting Superman in a film as a lawbreaking rogue who robs from the rich to give to the poor\\, it just is not consistent with what is historically understood about the character. They violate all the known rules of the force from prior film history and allow anybody to be proficient in the force and lightsabers with no training. They treat this movie like Game of Thrones and the Walking Dead\\, by trying to employ completely random plot twists\\, the only difference being they don't make sense. The only good in the movie is the special effects and excellent acting (especially by Mark Hamill). I hope Disney realizes how much money they will lose by disrespecting pre episode 7 Star Wars fans. The only people who like this movie are those who haven't seen or don't care about episodes 1 - 6. I am done with Star Wars unless disney REMAKES EPISODE 8 or they sell the franchise back to Lucas. I never want to see this movie again!","true":true}
