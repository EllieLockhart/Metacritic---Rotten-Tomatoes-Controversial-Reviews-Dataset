Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Has to be the worst star wars movie ever made. Too many many plot holes\\, ridiculous Princess Leia scene\\, Total disregard for Luke Skywalkers actual character\\, Snoke dying ridiculously\\, Reys parents thing. the whole Finn \/ Rose casino thing\\, out of place awkward humor and more. I feel as if this new trilogy got off to a solid enough start however Disney have completely blown any chance of redemption this series has left after this disaster. Too much social justice warrior talking points\\, boring one dimensional uninteresting characters especially Rey who is the main character\\, A good example of a female lead was the wonder woman movie NOT this feminist BS we see here. The fact that this movie is in the same actual series as empire strikes back is shame. Im not holding out any hope for ep9. I hope in a few years we can just wipe the slate clean and start all over again with a completely new story and arc","true":true}
