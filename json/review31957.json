Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"{Spoilers Ahead} As a Syfy movie it's alright and it's very visually pleasing\\, but on terms of a Star Wars movie it's not good and is probably the worst of all of the Star Wars films\\, mostly to the films inconsistencies in its characters and plot. Several things are in play here; the portrayal of characters such as Luke and Leia\\, Rey being a Mary Sue through out TLJ and even TFA\\, the uselessness of the the Casino Planet (Only there to Criticize Capitalism and Horse Racing)\\, the uselessness of the character Rose and her forced and nonexistent romance with Finn\\, the uselessness of Haldo\\, the \\\"Death\\\" of Phasma\\, and the untimely death of Snoke are some of the most blaring issues with the movies\\, and that doesn't mean that there isn't other issues with the movie such as the hyperspace issue and the off putting and mood killing humor. Not looking forward to Episode IX\\, Han Solo\\, and the New Trilogy being directed by Rian Johnson.","true":true}
