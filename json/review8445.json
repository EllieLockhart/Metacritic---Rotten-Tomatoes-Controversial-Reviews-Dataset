Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Film was an utter disappointment. Tired plot\\, Mary-Sue uninspired lead\\, confused and directionless villain. There was space combat that doesn't fit the cannon of the Star Wars universe. Ultimately\\, you're left with a feeling of \\\"how much worse could this get?\\\" at the end of the film. I weep for the third installment. ","true":true}
