Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall was a great movie but\\, left me confused after the first watch. Even after the second viewing\\, the movie feels disjoined. It feels like everything the filmakers set up in the last movie was abandoned. I loved the originality of this film and the focus on both development of the characters and the star wars universe as a whole. Visually the movie was an absolute joy to watch. The cinematography was impeccable and there are heaps of great shots. The story delightfully complex but in doing so\\, it meant that elements set up by the force awakens were abandoned\\, which left me feeling a little cheated and confused as most of the previous movie now feels like a massive red-herring. Overall\\, would recommend but wouldn't watch again.","true":true}
