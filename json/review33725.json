Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Just kill all the classic characters to tell know stories. WTF couldn't give everyone a satisfactory ending that actually ties into Star Wars lore. Have to change all the rules set by George years ago. Shame on Disney.","true":true}
