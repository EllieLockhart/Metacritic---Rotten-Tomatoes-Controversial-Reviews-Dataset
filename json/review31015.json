Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So everything that was built up in the previous movie is just ignored. The character of Luke is a completely different person than what we have seen. The main character is not believable at all in terms of what she can do. Hint to movie creators: Flawless characters are boring. The theme of the film seemed to be \\\"women are smart\\, men are dumb\\\".","true":true}
