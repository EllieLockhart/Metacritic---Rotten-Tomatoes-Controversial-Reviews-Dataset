Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films in the franchise. This installment still hits familiar beats from the existing movies\\, but then either flips them straight on their heads\\, or takes a turn only the most dedicated Star Wars fans could have seen coming! Whenever someone asks me which Star Wars film I feel like watching\\, The Last Jedi will definitely be among my first choices!","true":true}
