{"101487":129376,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a life long star wars fan\\, like many others\\, and I feel every negative review of this movie is justified. \\n\\nAfter a very promising opening of Poe attacking the Dreadnaught\\, I was hoping this movie would like up to the last (The Force Awakens)\\, however it didn't take long to see General Hux\\, an interesting and sharp character\\, in the mould of Grand Moff Tarkin quickly being turned into a Mr Bean-esk blithering idiot.\\n\\nThis is the first thing that comes to mind\\, but the list is long\\, and most of it\\, like Hux\\, is about wasted characters.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens built up the new characters well\\, Poe & Finn as great friends\\, Rey & Finn as love interests\\, Snoke.. Who is? Rey... Who is she? Where is Luke... Why is he in hiding? The Last Jedi quickly takes all of these questions and gives them the same boring answer.. it really doesn't matter.  \\n\\nSnoke\\, after being the strongest force user we've seen in the history of Star Wars\\, was promptly killed off\\, in a really bad way. No backstory\\, No answers as to how he turned Kylo\\, no answer to where he came from? Just... nothing. \\n\\nLuke\\, Rian Johnson turned our beloved Luke Skywalker from hero to coward\\, throwing the lightsabre away in his first scene shows how little care has been applied to the characters\\, Star Wars is a serious film\\, with a serious story\\, even TFA is serious\\, albeit with touches of comedy\\, which were brilliantly executed\\, wearn't as blatantly stupid as this. His force powers used in the end are beyond anything we've seen before\\, and not in a good way. I agree its attempting to be different for the sake of being different. Luke should have raised his X-Wing from the depths (like he couldn't in Empire)\\, met Kylo Ren on the battlefield\\, and gone down like Obi-Wan in A New Hope. That would have been fan service.\\n\\nRey\\, irrelevant from start to finish. The closest we get to her being interesting is when she attacks Luke in the rain... Again\\, she's had such minimal training and is ridiculously powerful... It took luke an entire film to be able to even get close to using his Jedi Skill as he did\\, and Rey does it in 5 minutes.\\n\\nPoe\\, probably the best part of the film\\, but awful story-arch. I see what they were trying to do\\, taking him from hot head to the new leader of the rebellion\\, but its an awful route there\\, and his (as well as others) script was very poor.\\n\\nFinn (and Rose) we'll bunch these together because they spend most of the movie together - Both awful performances (again I blame the script and director)\\,  Rose is barely likeable\\, let alone interesting enough to be the love interest of a main character (different for the sake of being different). Also their entire arch and their time on Canto-Blight is a waste of time.\\n\\nKylo Ren\\, in the end\\, in Rens ship\\, hovering over the AT-AT walkers and salt planet\\, him and Hux look and sounds like Dumb and Dumber. Ren throwing him about\\, screaming like a brat.. Awful. Also the story as to how he was turned never came\\, the flash back was all too brief with Luke. \\n\\nCaptain Phasma\\, By far the most underused character in the new trilogy\\, and potentially the most interesting\\, 2 minutes on screen time and falls into an explosion and dies (or maybe not\\, i'm sure they can drudge her up for another wasted amount of on screen time)\\, another waste.\\n\\nLeia\\, Gliding through space like Mary Poppins\\, A) Disregarding everything we know about Space B) Disregarding everything we know about people in space\\, in Star Wars\\, C) would have been a beautiful and peaceful way to allow Leia to die\\, drifting off into space frozen over in peace. What a horrible horrible moment. I read someone said\\, during that part of the film\\, out loud\\, \\\"This is ridiculous\\\". He wasn't wrong.\\n\\nThe story of the First Order being out of range to do damage to the resistance\\, A) Light Speed around them B) Deploy the fleet (they did this in the first battle\\, which lead to Ren attacking the ship and Leia drifting out to space\\, why was this not an option in the 2nd meeting). Its as though they'd just given up by this point\\, even Hux says \\\"What is the point in all of this if we can't destroy 3 ships\\\".. Here here Hux\\, you said it best. \\n\\nThe whole film is written very badly\\, clearly not by a Star Wars fan.\\n\\n\\nGood bits:\\nChewbacca not eating the Porg\\nLightspeed through the fleet\\nSeeing Lukes X-Wing sunken\\n\\nHere's hoping JJ Abrams can rescue this trilogy\\, however they've killed off the most interesting characters.. lets see what he can with whats left.\\n\\nPlease don't let Rian Johnson direct anything else in the Star Wars Universe...","true":true}
