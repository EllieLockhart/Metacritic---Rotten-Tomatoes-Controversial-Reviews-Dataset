Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  The differences in the film made it new and fresh from beginning to end.  I understand the negativity to the degree that people don't want it to change\\, they want it a particular way.  But as someone who understands that things need to change\\, things need to be turned on their heads\\, I liked it.\\nSee it\\, and don't fall prey to the negativity.","true":true}
