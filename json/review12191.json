Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a Star Wars fan from way back and I am very disappointed in the disjointed plot\\, the asinine and completely unrealistic uses of the force and technology\\, and the farcically contrived deaths. The only thing that saves this movie is that it has a great look to it and an amazing soundtrack. I really hope that Abrams can bring the story line back from the brink.","true":true}
