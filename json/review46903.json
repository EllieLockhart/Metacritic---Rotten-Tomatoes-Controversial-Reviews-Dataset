Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in thinking I'd love it after being told that the backlash was of the 'disgruntled-why-are-there-ghostbuster-ladies' type but I simply can't stress enough how that line of lazy\/manipulative reporting is misrepresenting fan criticism. If anything audiences have been far too kind. It isn't just a bad movie. It's fucking insulting to anyone with even half a brain.","true":true}
