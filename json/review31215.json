Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes. Luke acted nothing like who he has been his whole life and through all of the other movies. The sheer number of holes\\, illogical things\\, etc is too many to list. I disliked this so much\\, even after trying to like it because it was Star Wars\\, that I had to rate it. Something I never care to do.","true":true}
