{"101487":131319,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't usually write reviews\\, but in this case I felt I had to get this off my chest. And I wish to start this long review by stating that I am a huge fan of Star Wars. And I have been a fan of Star Wars for at least 20 years. I watched the original trilogy when I was a kid and I enjoyed the prequel trilogy as a teenager. Luke\\, Han Solo\\, Leia and Obi-Wan have been some of my all time favorite heroes in any cinematic universe or medium in general. And Anakin\/Darth Vader is also my all-time favorite villain. And when they announced they were going to create new Star Wars movies I was excited but also worried. But when The Force Awakens was released I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. \\n\\nIt had some very interesting new characters\\, and while it retreated the same steps as both The Phantom Menace and A New Hope\\, I felt this was fitting as it is how both the previous versions of Skywalker heros started their journeys. Like Anakin and Luke\\, Rey grew up on a desert\\, was a natural pilot\\, strong in the force and met a mentor\/father figure in Han Solo who dies tragically. A destiny surrounds the Skywalker line which is built on prophecy\\, Anakin was conceived by the force after all. And when it comes to the old characters I loved\\, I was so worried they would not feel the same. But Han Solo was perfect\\, and Leia was also perfect. While the movie had some problems with leaving to much backstory out\\, I loved it and with the amazing cliffhanger with Luke I was so excited for episode 8.\\n\\nBut before that movie came I also got to enjoy Rogue One\\, which is my second favorite Star Wars movie. It had the old style but made a completely new and amazing story with a bunch of fun new characters. It was also bold\\, tragic and unexpected. It had some truly spectacular moments with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. And the ending sequence with Darth Vader will go down in history as one of the most satisfying moments in Star Wars cinematic history. But the last scene with Leia holds a special place in my heart because I watched it just a few days before Carrie Fisher tragically passed away. That was sort of the last time I saw her in a movie before the tragic death of Carrie Fisher. And it was a scene that represented her beginning with a message of hope.\\n\\nAnd as Rogue One ended with hope\\, I was filled with hope for one my favorite fictional universes. I was certain the The Last Jedi would be just as amazing...\\n\\nBut I could have never been more wrong...\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a travesty\\, it is an abomination and an insult to the characters I love\\, and it has effectively ruined the story of the new Star Wars trilogy. And for me to explain why I think so I will have to go through a lot. I am going to talk mostly about the major problems.\\n\\nAnd let us start with the biggest problem this movie has. And that is Luke and how he is portrayed in this movie. From the original trilogy\\, he is the ideal hero. He begins his journey as an underdog\\, a kind and regular fellow who experiences true tragedy but chooses to continue on and try his best to save someone he has never met. That is because Luke is a very kind person who is shown to have so much love for his family and friends that he was willing to risk everything for them. And even though he goes through many hardships where he experiences loss and failure\\, he does not stop. He even risked everything to save his father from darkness\\, even with all the horrible things he had done. He has immense empathy and love for those close to him and he is extremely brave. His character harkens back to the romantic idea of a real knight\\, and in this case a Jedi Knight.\\n\\nBut in The Last Jedi we find out he for some completely uncharacteristic reason wanted to kill his own nephew because he felt the darkness in him. Even if it was for just one second\\, that does not sound even remotely like Luke\\, yes\\, Luke had darkness in him in the original trilogy\\, but he fought that darkness and won over it. He looked at his father and at his own hand and saw what he could become. And he defeated the biggest enemy there is\\, himself. And somehow\\, they chose to write Luke as someone who abandons his friends\\, his family and just leaves to die alone on some remote planet. That does not even remotely sound like Luke. \\n\\nAnd in TFA we were told he had went on a journey to search for the first temple of the Jedi. That made sense to me as I figured he went away to learn how to perhaps stop this cycle of hatred\\, to finally stop the Dark Side. That there was a purpose for him to leave behind everyone he loves. But no\\, there was no real purpose\\, they just turned Luke into the opposite of what he was\\, they turned him into a coward. Which completely disrespects the ending of Return of the Jedi and his whole struggle he went through and victory against the dark side and more importantly\\, himself.\\n\\nNow let's talk about another major problem with this movie\\, and that is the fact this is another case of history repeating itself. There is very little original content in this movie. As this movie is just a lot of scenes and plot points from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with slight twists to it.\\n\\nFor instance\\, Luke is essentially taking the role of Yoda in this movie. Rey is taking the role of Luke trying to find a master. Luke is as Yoda was\\, a hermit and a recluse. He\\, like Yoda\\, does not want to train Rey to begin with but eventually does\\, sort of... And they even added in a location on the island that is of the Dark Side\\, which Rey of course enters and has some form of vision\\, just like Luke.\\n\\nNow for the second part of the movie where they copy the same scene\\, but with a twist. Is when Rey stupidly decides to go after Kylo Ren on her own and gets captured. They recreate a version of Vaders famous scene where he tells Luke he is his father. But instead of Vader telling Luke he is family\\, they have Kylo Ren telling Rey she is a nobody and not even a Skywalker. Such originality. \\n\\nAnd this plot point is a major problem when it comes to The Force Awakens. Because if she is not a Skywalker\\, then why does she retread the same steps as Anakin and Luke? Why is she so strong with the force with no training? Why does Anakins Lightsaber call to her instead of Kylo Ren who is in fact a Skywalker? Why make such a big deal about her lineage when it does not even matter? Star Wars is a story of prophecy and destiny\\, and that is why I accepted that The Force Awakens was a case of history repeating itself. But if she is not a Skywalker that whole part falls apart\\, the prophecy of the chosen one has been completely discarded. \\n\\nNext\\, we have Snoke\\, a character of much mystery that was introduced in TFA. We always thought that The Emperor was the prime sith lord. But this new very powerful sith who we know nothing about and was built up in TFA as the one who truly turned Kylo Ren amounted to just a parody of the Emperor and a blatant copy. They even recreated the scene with Luke\\, Vader and The Emperor\\, but once again\\, with a slight twist. \\n\\nSnoke reveals to Rey and Kylo Ren that their connection was his doing\\, which is very similar to him revealing to Luke in ROTJ that he tricked the Rebels into attacking. Then Snoke uses the force to torture Rey\\, just like Palpatine tortured Luke. And then we have Kylo Ren taking on the role of Vader betraying Snoke and kills him\\, way too easily I should say. But then comes the tiny twist. While Vader turns to the Light in this moment\\, Kylo Ren turns completely to the Dark Side. Effectively ruining that character for me.\\n\\nBecause one of the best aspects of Kylo Ren in TFA for me was that he was a sith who struggled with the temptation of the light side. That has never really been a concept before\\, as it has always been that the Dark Side is the temptation and the corruption of self. And that to me was so perfect and so interesting. But that is now thrown out the window in another attempt to just copy old ideas.\\n\\nAnd we have Phasma truly end up as the Boba Fett of the new trilogy\\, amounting to nothing but a throw away villain with not a single ounce of depth. Heck she even falls into an abyss of sorts. We have Del Toros character eventually betray the resistance\\, like how Lando betrayed the rebels. And lastly\\, they had to add a copy of the walker scene from Hoth in ESB\\, just with a twist again as it is not snow\\, but salt and crystals and they don't use air speeders but some truly bad ground gliders.\\n\\nBut there are many other things in this movie that is just truly bad storytelling. And that is the journey and arc of Finn and Poe. First let's talk about the fact that the main plot point in this movie is that the resistance can't jump to lightspeed because they are being tracked and that they only have one jump left. But somehow The First Order does not just send some ships ahead with lightspeed to cut them off. They continue a slow crawl throughout the whole movie. Why? I have yet to find a good explanation for this.\\n\\nAnd so\\, because of some stupid reasons that could have been completely avoided. Poe\\, Finn and the new pointless character Rose decides to leave on a journey to find a code cracker to hack into Snokes ship\\, so they can scramble their lightspeed tracker or whatever it was. This leads us to a completely new place filled with lots of weird stuff that feels very out of place for Star Wars. This is a big part of the movie\\, but it also has no real meaning. As what they all accomplish in the end is nothing. As they are betrayed by Del Toros character which causes more resistance deaths. Well thank you Finn\\, Poe and Rose\\, what an excellent job you did. Such great heroes we have in this new trilogy. True role models for the younger generation.\\n\\nAnd then the new commander lady\\, Holdo must sacrifice herself to save the resistance. Something that could have easily been avoided had she just explained to Poe what their real plans where to begin with. And so\\, she does a kamikaze lightspeed jump into Snokes ship which completely devastates it. And this is a huge problem\\, if that was a possibility all along\\, why on earth did they not do that earlier?! Why waste all those bombers in the beginning? Why did not the rebels do something similar in the original trilogy? Why is this not a typical tactic in Star Wars? If lightspeed impacts can do that much damage\\, why has no one weaponized it? And why did the previous ships in the Resistance fleet just let themselves die and not try to crash their ship like Holdo did? \\n\\nNow back to Luke. Yoda shows up\\, as a truly terrible looking puppet I might add. And he acts as the complete crazy version of himself as he was when he first met Luke. Not the calm and wise master he shortly showed himself to be. He somehow talks some sense into Luke\\, by tricking him into believing he burned ancient texts. What a great lesson\\, we should just burn old texts because they are outdated.\\n\\nAnd in the end Luke comes to the rescue to save the day. And then we get a moment of something that could have been a real duel of substance. But it too ends in disappointment as Luke is not even there\\, facing Kylo Ren truly like a real knight. He instead uses a similar projection power like Snoke did with Rey and Kylo Ren.... And why would not Kylo Ren notice it when Luke was using the Lightsaber he just destroyed? And when the projection ends\\, Luke just dies... of what? A freaking heart attack? So Snoke could connect two people from across the galaxy with no problems while Luke dies while he does something similar.\\n\\nAlso\\, if I remember correctly\\, both Leia and Luke actually say to one another that Kylo Ren is lost and beyond redemption. What?! If he saw the light in Darth Vader\\, then why on earth would there not be light left in Kylo Ren. So\\, he was willing to risk everything for Vader who was completely sith\\, someone who killed his mentor in front of his own eyes. But he is not willing to save Kylo Ren? \\n\\nThere are many more problems with this movie\\, Leia is shown as a fairly inept leader\\, as she does not really do much in the movie and she slaps Poe for going against orders. Yeah\\, because physical violence is how the good guys should punish their own. \\n\\nThe humor in this movie is not very funny and feels very forced. It is often boring\\, and the story is so contrived and stupid it is baffling to me how this movie got made. It took all the interesting questions they asked with TFA and pissed all over it. The revelations were lame\\, characters amounted to nothing\\, but blatant copies and they turned a beloved hero into a joke. Heck the big exciting cliffhanger at the end of TFA continues in TLJ as just a stupid joke. And we never get to learn where Maz Kanat got that lightsaber either. And she has a bad cameo that comes out of nowhere. All the male characters are either incompetent and buffoons\\, and all the female characters are arrogant\\, overly emotional and violent. \\n\\nThey did not really change anything either. Rey is a light side user\\, Kylo Ren is a Dark Side user. They removed what made Kylo Ren an interesting character\\, and they made Rey something that does not really makes sense in the lore. This movie did barely nothing that was original\\, it knowingly broke down characters people love to make some form of point. It has so many glaring plot holes and additions that makes no sense and it is overall a truly bad movie. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the actors overall did a good job\\, even though most of the dialogue was corny and awkward. Mark Hamill did still do a great job acting\\, but I did not feel like I was watching him play Luke again. And the visuals in some of the action sequences was good\\, but without any substance to them. Overall\\, as far as Star Wars action sequences\\, this movie has some of the least exciting ones. \\n\\nThis movie has made me not care about the new trilogy anymore. Episode 9 could come out tomorrow and I would not care at all. And in some ways\\, it has ruined the old movies. But I guess I should just ignore everything after episode 6. Or else I will feel totally depressed. But it has definitely ruined episode 7 for me. \\n\\nThis is without a doubt the most disappointing movie I have ever seen in my life. Something I thought I would never say for a Star Wars movie. The direction they are taking this new trilogy is just not for me anymore. I don't feel like it is a story that has any role models or any heroes to look up to. Rey is just a character who has been granted power without truly sacrificing much for it. While Luke had to struggle and face defeat and failure to eventually gain victory. Rey has not really faced anything so far that she could not defeat. There is no depth to her that I feel makes for a interesting and a heroic person.\\n\\nSo\\, I can't really give this movie anything other than the lowest possible score. As to me\\, it is truly unwatchable and a movie that has made me lose hope for the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
