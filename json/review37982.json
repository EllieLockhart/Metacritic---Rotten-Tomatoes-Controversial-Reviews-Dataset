Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The soundtrack\\, the visual effects\\, the picture\\, the script\\, all the team\\, the references and the shots were just awesome\\, It was an incredible Star Wars movie (just the casino scene I think it was unnecessary).","true":true}
