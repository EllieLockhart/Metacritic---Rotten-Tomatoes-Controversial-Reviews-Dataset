Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a well made movie that had beautiful visuals and good moments.  Unfortunately\\, the direction that they have taken I completely disagree with.  It's as though all the things that JJ Abrams had set up Rian Johnson just ignored\\, and feels like a slap in the face.  I've been waiting for 25 years to see Luke Skywalker's true potential and I get to see him drink titty milk and fade away.  Despite a well-crafted movie\\, I can't get over the fact that we were provided a bunch of non-answers to so many things.  Last Jedi set up the mystery around Snoke and who Rey's parents were only to have Last Jedi completely disregard these elements.  I respect the bold direction that they are going\\, I just think it's the wrong direction.","true":true}
