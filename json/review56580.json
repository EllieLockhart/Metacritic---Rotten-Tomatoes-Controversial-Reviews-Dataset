Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an incredibly polarizing film. It takes bold\\, unpredictable moves in developing Star Wars. Luke has become resigned and disillusioned\\, having lost his youthful optimism due to life experience and failure\\, and the central message of the film is to stop clinging to the past. \\n\\nPersonally\\, I really enjoyed this film a lot. First of all\\, I find its philosophy of letting go of the past worth pondering\\, and find Luke's character arc intriguing. Moreover\\, if we take the film on its own merits\\, rather than making the standard of its success how faithful and respectful it is to the original Star Wars films\\, it is really good. The character development is strong. Luke finally overcomes his depression due to his past failure and manages a last act of dramatic heroics. Poe Dameron starts to mature in his judgment of leadership tactics\\, preparing him for the greater responsibility he will take on in the future. People criticize the casino excursion\\, but it is through this experience that Finn develops commitment to a cause\\, rather than to be independent and sell himself to the highest bidder. Rey and Kylo Ren go through a fascinating development\\, pulled towards each other and yet apart. This culminates in an awesome fight scene\\, where they team up together against a common enemy\\, and then part ways. It's one of the best Star Wars fight scenes\\, and Luke's final stand is a powerful ending. This has great characters\\, development and character arcs\\, incredible battles (space battles\\, lightsabers\\, and internal battles). It triggers emotions\\, and proposes a controversial philosophy for fans to discuss. \\n\\nAs the most polarizing Star Wars movie\\, the Last Jedi is essential viewing. I'd recommend anyone to watch it\\, and to make up your own mind about it.","true":true}
