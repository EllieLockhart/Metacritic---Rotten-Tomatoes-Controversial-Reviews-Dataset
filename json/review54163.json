Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could give it fewer stars\\, I would. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Visually\\, the film is spectacular.  Plot and script wise it is hopeless. I didn't think I would ever see a star wars movie l liked less than Attack of the Clones. I was wrong. I was hopeful after Rogue One that they had found their footing. Not so. The first Order and Resistance are both inept at virtually everything they do. Most of the \\\"action\\\" sequences had no actual impact on the plot or story\\, with few exceptions. It is hard to be specific without giving away spoilers. The plot is lazy\\, riddled with Starkiller base sized holes\\, and leaves the audience wondering if the movie was in fact supposed to be a parody.  How the critics can possibly rate it so high is beyond jarring. It leaves me to wonder how many are paid by networks owned by Disney. You can sprinkle glitter on fresh TaunTaun dung to attract the attention of many a passerby\\, but upon closer examination it just won't pass the smell test.","true":true}
