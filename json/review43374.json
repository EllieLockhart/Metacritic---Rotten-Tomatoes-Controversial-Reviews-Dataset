Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an absolute disappointment.  The way the character of Luke was disrespected was a disgrace. Some of the so called jokes were pitiful and the Canto Bight storyline was a complete waste of time.","true":true}
