This time around\\, the main emotions you will experience are hate\\, anger\\, disgust and desperation.No wonder some (many) players have had mixed feelings to put it mildly about this game. This sole fact demonstrates that the game hit right we\u2019re it was aiming.So yes\\, the game is beautiful\\, DA is splendid (kudo to the soundtrack)\\, the acting is without a doubt the best seen in any game so far\\, the gameplay (e.g. combat) has been notably improved since Part I and the storytelling remains strong.There are also some lengthy parts and several repetitive mechanics that might bother you sometimes. Not all characters are as charismatics as you d hope\\, but again\\, neither are we...In addition the game (elegantly) tackles sensitive societal topics that will drive some people back\\, and makes you wonder.I was left in awe several times\\, and at the end\\, of course. I felt like I have never been closer to play an (exceptional) movie.In short\\, the last of us Part II hit right in the feels. Are you willing to handle it\\, that for you to answer. Will you enjoy it\\, or be glad you went on this journey\\, only playing it will tell.In terms of video game experience\\, TLOU2 will share with FFVII\\, OoT\\, MGS\\, HL2\\, TLOU1\\, MGSV\\, BotW the mighty shelf of titles that made video games and players grow.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
