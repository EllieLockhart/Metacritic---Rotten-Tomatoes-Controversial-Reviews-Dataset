Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Legendary...I believe this is a mixture of the old with the new view of the saga...preparing us for not only the last chapter of this trilogy but for the new movies planned to continue the legacy...It's beautiful\\, full of surprises but all the emotions tend to change so quickly\\, you go from laughing to suffering from the attack of little hiden jedis chopping onions that makes you shed a tear...2 1\/2 hours seems long...but It was the correct time to present this chapter\\, full of drama\\, humor\\, new and known characters and the fights..uff ...the fights...Hope the next  one last even longer...Enjoy one of the best movies of the year.","true":true}
