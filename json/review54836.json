Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is clear now that Disney\\, Rian\\, nor JJ truly understand how to tell a proper Star Wars story. Rian has created a movie that insults the story of Star Wars\\, the Skywalker family\\, and everything George Lucas built. The plot for Episode VIII\\, a \\\"high-speed\\\" spaceship chase (anyone remember what took place in ESB with the Falcon and Vader chasing it?)\\, is a sham of a story. Add in a useless side-plot that added almost nothing to the actual story\\, a \\\"master\\\" of the dark side who is felled so easily\\, every characters suddenly becoming a comedian\\, Super Leia\\, Emo Skyping between Rylo\/Ben and Rey\\, no actual deepening of the mythos of the Force or its understanding (Really\\, Yoda's best piece of wisdom is that we \\\"learn most from our failures??\\\" Was he reading those lame motivational posters in the afterworld?)\\, and more paper-thin characters or half-thought out story arcs? I am loathe to show this crap to my children. They will be o disappointed. As much as people seem to enjoy piling crap on the sequels\\, George had a story to tell and he told it (which I happen to think he did well\\, for the most part). What is the story here? All I see are dollar signs\\, and as a Disney stockholder\\, I will likely sell my shares. For shame Disney.","true":true}
