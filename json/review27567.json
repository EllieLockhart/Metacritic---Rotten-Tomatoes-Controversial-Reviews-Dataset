{"101487":161435,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-09-04","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, the peak of mediocrity is this movie's highest achievement. An entire movie base on subversion fails as it is a sub version of what it could have been. Looking pretty allowed those that saw it to sit through it and it was flashy enough to force watchers not to think\\, but after\\, there is nothing but questions\\, and the subversion already sets up that the answers will be just \\\"ignore that\\, it was a joke\\\". \\n\\nThis movie would be good at being screenshots\\, or a slideshow\\, but it is not a \\\"movie\\\" as a story recorded by camera as a set of moving images. It is a series of events that look cool\\, but logically do not match. Time and flow are both broken in this story with Rey and Luke spending days on a planet during a 16 hour maximum space chase. \\n\\nAs a stand alone movie that was never seen by a person that saw Star Wars\\, it looks pretty\\, but it resets itself\\, the movie has no point. It starts with a pile of people in a few ships fleeing from a massive army. It ends with a smaller pile of people in 1 ship fleeing from a massive army.\\n\\nFrom the view of connecting into 8 other movies\\, it is a poor attempt at a new episode 5. Even in the theatre\\, the movie felt like it finished when the silent explosion occurred\\, with the jump into hyperspace through a ship.  There was still 45 minutes left that dragged through and felt closer to another hour and a half. None of the characters felt like they progressed\\, they just stayed the same\\, suffering from bipolar disorder. Angry to happy to sad back to angry was a common reaction through it. \\n\\nCharacters that were added were not interesting\\, feeling more like cardboard than actual people. \\nHoldo was the standard Cranky Old Lady type that makes one wonder how she kept her job. She is dismissing the hotshot pilot for his arrogance while being arrogant\\, and her death\\, being in the same movie as her life\\, has no weight. I actually felt glad she flew it as it means her character is gone\\, allowing a possibly better character to exist. \\nThe commander on the new Nazi side acted like a 30-year-old version of Draco Malfoy\\, and was dragged through the mud (literally) as such. He is supposed to be the 2nd in command\\, yet is treated like the janitor's supervisor.  \\nLuke somehow is now the most cynical nihilist ever\\, even though he rescued his father\\, the one who killed thousands of people to the point that his shadow is now seen as the most iconic image of evil in fiction\\, yet was ready to kill from a dream? \\nRey was more of a stand-in for the emotion the scene was portraying. If you were confused in what you should feel\\, look at her face\\, she does not change\\, but reacts to what ever occurs to her. \\n\\nOverall\\, a good gasoline movie\\, like those of Michael Bay\\, but if you want a plot\\, forget it. On the scale of who got paid\\, between the gasoline guys and the writers\\, It was all gasoline guys and the desired events were sketched on a napkin at 6am at the end of a sleepless night. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe new series would be better if it focused on Kylo Ren. He could have been the centre of a new 6 part series. Showing his rise and fall into power on either the light or dark\\, or trying to become the Gray. Rather than what is there being a retread of the originals\\, but with reduced plot points and more gasoline. These new ones also contain more one dimensional characters than early 50s stuff. In the past 2 movies\\, there has been little to no arc in their characters\\, and the most recent felt like it ripped through 5\\, completed 6 and then reset back to the end of 5. I would not be suprised\\, unless major retroactive plot tweaking is done\\, that the Last Jedi could be not watched and there would still be a complete plot","true":true}
