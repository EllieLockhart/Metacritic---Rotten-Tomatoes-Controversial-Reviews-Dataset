Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't imagine a better movie in a franchise that has already sparked 8 movies. The Last Jedi is beatifully shot\\, exceptionally well-crafted emotional ride with a charming tone that bonds together seamlessly what Star Wars is at its heart and postmodernism.","true":true}
