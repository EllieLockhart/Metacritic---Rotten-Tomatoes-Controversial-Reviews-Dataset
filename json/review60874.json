Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is an absolute masterpiece for anyone who enjoys video games. You alternate between 2 characters\\, Abby and Ellie for the majority of the game in the first couple hours you come across whatvwas for me the most difficult thing to watch in a video game the death of Joel Miller which was in my opinion unnecessarily brutal. However as yku play the game you come to find out that the brutality of Joel's death wasn't just on him alone this whole world is shown to have brutality in equal measure throughout the game. From killing people with baseball bats to hammers\\, from setting people on fire to shooting their arm off\\, I unexpectedly realized just how brutal this game could get in which I realized the way Joel was killed wasn't abnormal for this world. As you play the game and more particularly play as Abby who in my opinion had the funnest sequences in the entire game showed the kind of person she is and her motives for killing Joel. The death of Joel while completely devastating and for some heart breaking  was justified and i fully understand just why Abby went out of her way to kill Joel. If you b like games that put you through a emotional roller-coaster similar to the first one then the second one will be for you. I found myself emotionally drained by the end of the game but the story and gameplay as well as the graphics are by far some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. In my opinion this is the best game  Naughty Dog has ever created and truly worthy of 10\/10 and GOTY.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
