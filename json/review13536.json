Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like the wrote the movie backwards. It's as if they said\\, \\\"Wouldn't it be SO COOL if we had a scene where [really big cinematic stuff happens]?\\\" And then someone else in the room who knows about Star Wars said\\, \\\"That would never happen. That could in fact never happen in the Star Wars universe.\\\" But then that first person replied\\, \\\"Ah\\, who cares\\, it'll be awesome. We're gonna do that anyway!\\\" And then they spent millions of dollars making things that don't quite work in the story look amazing.","true":true}
