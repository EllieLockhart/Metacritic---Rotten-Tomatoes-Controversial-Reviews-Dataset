Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A slow speed space chase.  That's most of it.  Force feeding new bland characters like Rose while disrespecting the legend\\, Luke.  Choppy plot\\, scientific\/logic holes\\, force lore inconsistencies... Of course there's some cool stuff to look at. Left the theater bummed with no enthusiasm for what's left of Star Wars.","true":true}
