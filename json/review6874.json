Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful film. Everything you have read about what is wrong with it is true - poor writing\\, inconsistent tone\\, depressing story\\, nothing much happens apart from some excellent cgi  explosions. The villains are a mocked all the time\\, which diminishes them as a credible threat. The new characters Holdo and DJ are wasted and their behaviour is ridiculous. Leia flies through space without so much as a suit. Luke milks the mammary gland of a sea cow and drinks the liquid with relish. Did we really need to see this? And there is a whole sequence involving the rescue of space horses from on a casino planet that has no point to it whatsoever. Avoid this debacle if you enjoyed any of the first 6 Star Wars films.","true":true}
