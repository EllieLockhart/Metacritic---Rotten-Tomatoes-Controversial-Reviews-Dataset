We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's amazing how divisive this game is...  I was floored by it.  It consider it not simply the best narrative in gaming\\, but one of the best narratives in ANY medium.  And while playing I kept waiting for whatever happens that caused so much controversy and hate.  At first\\, I thought it was Joel dying - but that didn't make sense to me.  Game of Thrones (before the last seasons) killed off tons of beloved characters and people still almost universally loved it.  Was it that fact that Ellie is gay?  That couldn't be it.  We knew that from the trailers and the DLC for the first game.  Maybe some didn't realize it\\, but there certainly can't be enough people angry at a character being gay to justify so many negative reviews.  Then Lev came about\\, and I thought maybe it's that - but how could\\, what quite possibly be my favorite character be hated by so many unless it's bigotry.  But I need to believe there's not enough bigots to account for so much dislike of the game.  No that couldn't be it.  So I kept playing\\, figured the problem would reveal itself later - but all the way until credits rolled the story just kept impressing me more and more.  I do not understand how so many people dislike it.  It's puzzling.\r\rI've read several negative reviews\\, and I just can't seem to see the other side of things.  I assume it's the same for them\\, they probably think I'm blind or crazy for liking it so much (or assume I'm lying for some reason).  It's baffling how divisive this story can be.  It feels like it's literally a coin toss and you either hate the story or love it.  I guess I consider myself lucky I fell on the love it side.\r\rBut everyone can agree that graphics\\, gameplay and other aspects of production are amazing.  The only warning I'll give to people wanting to play it - it is a very linear game.  No choices affecting the story\\, the level design is well done but it is point A to point B.  Which is exactly how the first game was\\, so if you liked the first game\\, you'll like this game - as far as gameplay goes.  As for the story\\, I guess you'll need to flip the coin.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
