Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If all you care about is Action then this is the 2nd best Star wars movie ever.. If you care about the Story line and  where and how things happen this movie is the 4th worst ever! Poe just the run in the burning building. who is snoke? How did Luke do that and how did that Kill him? Rey parents are who? what? why? what was the purpose of the code cracker? waste of time. how was this the longest star wars ever and learned very little. why have c3po and r2d2 in the movie if you gonna back ground them like that? i get doing that in rouge one but star wars really smh . Yoda was a pleasant surprise but still seemed rushed could have done more or better. purple head girl what was the point of her and her terrible plan. Chewy will he fared better then c3p0 and r2\\, just a little. Look the visual was great. rian Johnson would do good over at DC and WB with what they keep failing at. just dont let him have 100% control of story line and writing.","true":true}
