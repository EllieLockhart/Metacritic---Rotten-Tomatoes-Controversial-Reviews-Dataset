Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but insipidly plotted\\, with the story line falling into potholes on a regular basis.The First Order can follow the Rebellion through light speed now\\, but no one -- including the screenwriters -- figure out that is essentially the end of the rebellion. Pointless trips to a gambling planet and Rey's journey through a mirrored ;pit add absolutely  . . .nothing to the story. And Luke dies because   . . . why? He runs out of energy???? This movie demonstrates how brilliant George Lucas' vision was in its simplicity.","true":true}
