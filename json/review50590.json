Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"30+ years of lore and mythos overturned. Shallow character development. Unnecessary power expansion. Edge solely for edge sake. A subplot that makes 0 difference other than making a good 45 min TV special into a 2.5 hour movie. Honestly could have been accomplished in a 22min episode of Rebels. The most disappointing character assassination. Will not watch again. Star Wars ended with Return of the Jedi.","true":true}
