Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I have ever seen. The visuals were great\\, the acting was good... but it's like they got sharknado writers for the script. This is a big budget b movie. Thank god Harrison Ford won't be back","true":true}
