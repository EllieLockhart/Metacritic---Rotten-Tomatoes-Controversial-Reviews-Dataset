Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good characters are old and their acting sucks in this one. New characters are unlikable and their acting seems rushed. The comedy in this movie may work for audience's under 10 years of age. Thanks again for ruining a once good movie. Empire strikes back was the best one and George Lucas didn't direct it. I said my peace. ","true":true}
