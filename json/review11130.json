Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hmm... why don\u2019t they just bring Vader back next. I wanted to like this movie\\, but the recycled storyline and random \u201cluck\u201d of the heroes was too much. Sure the visuals are amazing\\, but I expected a movie I\u2019d want to see more than once.","true":true}
