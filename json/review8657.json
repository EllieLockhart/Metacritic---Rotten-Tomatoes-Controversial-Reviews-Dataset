Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time user here. I created an account because I am a life long star wars fan and I am sorely disappointed by this movie. This movie does not stay true to the Skywalker saga at all! And LOL to all the people who say the ratings are caused by bots -- I'm not a bot even if I am a first time commenter. I just deeply care about how they do these movies. \\n\\nAlso\\, can we stop with the whole SJW agenda? I'm an Asian woman and trust me\\, the forced agenda in this movie just distracts from everything. Keep politics out of Star Wars!","true":true}
