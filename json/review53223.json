Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bloated and vacuous at the same time - but that is not the real problem. The film has its share of fleeting special moments but they are ultimately crushed by the story\u2019s lack of soul...we are left with a mutation of Star Wars DNA. Poor stewardship of our beloved series by Rian Johnson and Disney...shameful. After the 1st 3 episodes were released I was fine with the storyline\\, only disappointed with the execution and chemistry on-screen (mainly down on the acting and silly characters like Jar Jar Binx)...but am now am even more saddened that George Lucas is not involved with completing the final chapters of the saga. Perhaps they can find a way to recover Episode 9 - but the wreckage of the Last Jedi will be difficult to salvage.","true":true}
