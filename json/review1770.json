Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan of almost 40 years I went into watching TLJ as I always do - excited\\, giddy with anticipation\\, and looking forward to seeing where the story goes. TLJ did not disappoint. Is it perfect? No\\, of course not. For me\\, though\\, it did what I want Star Wars movies to do - entertained and enthralled. Well done Rian Johnson.","true":true}
