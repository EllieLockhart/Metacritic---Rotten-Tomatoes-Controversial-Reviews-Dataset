Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this movie was absolutely terrible. Easily the worst movie in the franchise. However this is disney star wars so I keep that separate from Lucas Star Wars. I am totally baffled that the \\\"critcs\\\" gave it a 91% while the audience gave it 44% with 211K. Seems fishy\\, no?","true":true}
