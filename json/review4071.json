Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant and brave would be two words I would use to sum up this film. Rian Johnson have done an amazing job in this new addition to the saga that I have loved since I was just a little girl. So many new and exciting ideas are introduced in this film and they add on to the Star Wars universe in the most daring and exciting way. The actors\\, especially Adam Driver\\, were amazing and helped earning a special place in my heart.","true":true}
