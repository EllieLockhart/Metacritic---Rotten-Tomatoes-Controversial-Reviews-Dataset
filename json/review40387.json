Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is s  Star Wars political correct  movie (New term is progressive). The Men are diots. Poe can't do anything right and made to look like a little boy in front of the middle aged purple hair character. Fin whos battle trained gets knocked out by the little engineer and given a lesson on riding alien horses. Luke who was a good old fashion hero\\, brave \/ honourable\/ persistent  was made to be pathetic.  The super powerful Snoke came out of the shower in his bath robes and forgot  not to leave any light saber beside his chair.\\n\\nYup\\, us fans that don't like the movie have every right not to like it! The people  that love it that's fair enough too. But how about  2 separate movies one witj Star wars with Sith\\, Jedi\\, bounty hunters\\, light saber duels\\, cool aliens and another star wars movie  with wimpy males\\, flying princess\\, change the light sabre to  magic wands. \\nGood bye to the Star wars universe .","true":true}
