Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is fun to watch. It has some great visuals\\, and the most important characters deliver excellent performances. There is admittedly some poorly-used time with the subplots\\, but they don't make the movie \\\"awful\\\"\\, by any stretch. It's also not a five-star movie\\, so don't go expecting to see the sci-fi version of the Godfather. \\n\\nThat's probably the point\\, here: the lower audience score is attributable to sky-high expectations from passionate fans that weren't met. \\n\\nLong story short\\, it's worth watching.","true":true}
