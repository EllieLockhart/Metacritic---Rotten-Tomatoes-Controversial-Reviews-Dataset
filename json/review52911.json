Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A+\\nI just adore this movie. Its a unique star wars film but it did require multiple viewings to appreciate its amazement\\, it adds new and interesting themes to the franchise that I've always wanted to see explored. Very sufficient character arcs\\, gorgeous direction\\, excellent score and so many empowering moments. Greatest film in the franchise since the Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
