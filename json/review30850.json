Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So as the Marvel Cinematic Universe is doing so well\\, Disney decides to apply the same silly light \\\"comedic\\\" tone to Star Wars. A mediocre Story\\, everything but clever writing\\, un-earned drama (tons of it)\\, on your face \\\"toys to be\\\" characters... Star Wars the last Jedi is the worst entry in the franchise. A two and a half hours running time that had no significant meaning in the overall storyline. A movie full of memorable eye-candy cool cinematographic moments\\, but not really scenes\\, yet  epic and fan pleasing moments can easily dissolve without a strong story to make them believable (Because the script say so); is the GOT S7 syndrome\\, writers that don't understand or do not care of the material. A film that was made thinking only in how the audience would react if we do this or that and not in actually telling a story.","true":true}
