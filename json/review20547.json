Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've loved every Star Wars movie that ever came out.  I've loved the series so much since I was a kid that they could do no wrong...until this one.  Aside from the story flaws (it wasn't sure if it wanted to be \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\"\\, \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\"\\, \\\"A New Hope\\\"\\, \\\"Harry Potter\\\"\\, \\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\\"\\, or \\\"Sesame Street\\\") I had this peculiar feeling that I was being brainwashed about religion during most of the movie.  Very offensive & unenjoyable.  Stop being so freaking political.  Just make entertaining movies.  I literally don't think I'll watch anymore Star Wars movies after this one.  I'm over it.","true":true}
