Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the Star Wars franchise.....  but I feel Disney hired a millennial director to dump on my childhood.\\n\\nThis is the worst way they could treat my favorite hero.\\n\\nI'm angry at Disney.... show some respect for the characters that people love.","true":true}
