Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2 good plot lines and one bad one. Great performances from Isac\\, Hamill\\, Ridley\\, and Driver. The chemistry between Ridley\\, Driver\\, and Hamill is amazing. The two weaknesses of this film is the Casino storyline and some comedy miss placed. thats why it gets a 4 stars from me and not 5. Great special effects good writing overall but not a perfect film by far but builds on the Star Wars mythology for sure.","true":true}
