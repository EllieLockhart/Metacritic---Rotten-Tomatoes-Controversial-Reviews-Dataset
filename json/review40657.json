Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is what happens when someone who hates Star Wars makes a Star Wars movie. The introduction of new characters who add nothing to the story\\, side quests that do nothing to advance the story\\, revelations specifically designed to remove anything special to the main characters\\, and pointless deaths do not \\\"honor the saga's rich legacy\\\" or add \\\"surprising twists\\\". All I can tell from the critical reviews is that the critics were never Star Wars fans.","true":true}
