Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing.\\nI'm not a Star Wars fanboy\\, just a 50-something dad who has enjoyed the past films and loved going with my family to watch. But if you make a film in such a wonderful Franchise\\, I feel you should respect its conventions far more than this did: Luke's character\\, Force powers and so on. (Personally I found the disdain and snark from Vice Admiral Purple Hair really grated - as if prior Star Wars plots relied on carefully thought through plans and real-world tactical prudence. The way Poe was set up and knocked down felt really forced and graceless to me). Even as a generic sci-fi film it didn't work for me - I'd reference\\, among other things\\, the flabby casino excursion\\, underwhelming appearance and departure of Snork\\, pathetic 'chase the cruisers' set-up\\, and the fact that Finn's whole special mission was pointless.\\nI'm not a hater\\, but I find myself very sympathetic to the outraged fans here. Sufficiently\\, in fact\\, to motivate me to write this\\, my first review on Rotten Tomatoes.\\nIt's not wholly bad\\, of course. I found Kylo Ren\\, Rey and Finn all interesting characters I could invest in\\, and loved the actors.\\nBut we left the cinema quiet and disappointed\\, and I saw similar expressions around me from most of the audience over the age of 10.\\nYou know\\, as a businessman it's also the commercial incompetence that grips me. To screw up such a great Franchise and leave your customers feeling disappointed and underwhelmed - come on. This will be the first S=tar Wars movie where I don't buy DVDs etc\\, and we almost certainly won't go to see the next one. Very sad.\\nOverall: a let down and a missed opportunity due to a lack of conviction\\, a lack of discipline and a lack of sympathy for the universe\\, combined with some weak-assed writing and direction. Shame. Time to move on from Star Wars","true":true}
