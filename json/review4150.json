Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Buena a secas\\, esperaba mas\\, las bromas fuera de lugar abundan\\, y no entend\u00ed para que pusieron a los progs\\, me dio la impresi\u00f3n que es la versi\u00f3n Disney de los ping\u00fcinos de madagascar","true":false}
