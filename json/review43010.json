Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was thoroughly enjoyable and I will be seeing it again soon enough.  It more than enough twists to keep a pretzel guessing and the movie definitely has something for even the most casual Star Wars fan.","true":true}
