Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Uno de los episodios m\u00e1s memorables de toda la saga. Aplaudo la valent\u00eda de la producci\u00f3n por tomar riesgos que traen resultados magn\u00edficos para la pel\u00edcula. Escenas \u00e9picas nunca antes vistas\\, con un desarrollo que muchas personas no entienden o pueden aceptar debido a su propia mentalidad. The Last Jedi vale la pena y \u00a1no puedo esperar para ver como todo se desenlaza en el episodio IX!","true":false}
