Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw TLJ during the opening weekend and was disappointed but the storyline that was presented. \\n\\nThe movie felt like a cop out - from the crawler at the beginning\\, to the sudden usage of tracking (never once seen in any of the 'canon' stories) to the mini death canon.\\n\\nThe movie had great potential\\, but instead showcased a underwhelming story. So much potential wasted..","true":true}
