Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made the prequels look Oscar worthy.  \\n\\nThe acting in those movies was bad\\, but I think some of the newbies in this one were worse.  As annoying as Jar Jar was\\, Rose is right up there with him now.\\n\\nAt least the prequels stayed true to the legendary characters and Star Wars lore.  This movie torched all of that.\\n\\nAt least in the prequels we were treated to some badass villains (emperor\\, Darth Maul\\, General Grievous).  In this piece of crap we saw Snoke die (and not in an epic battle scene) and Kylo Ren destroy his mask and pout and brew throughout. \\n\\nLuke is dead.  Snoke is dead.  There are no developed heroes or villains to make me want to watch the next movie.  We'll probably just have to sit through more bad acting and bad storytelling.  OR\\, we don't.  I think I'll be sitting any future SW movies out and that includes the Han Solo movie.","true":true}
