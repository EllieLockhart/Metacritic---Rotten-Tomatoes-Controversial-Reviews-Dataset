Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a bad movie -dropping bombs in space? Horribly written. Best scenes looked like they took them directly from one of the Battlefront games.  Horribl. No reason to see ep.9 . Bye Star Wars.","true":true}
