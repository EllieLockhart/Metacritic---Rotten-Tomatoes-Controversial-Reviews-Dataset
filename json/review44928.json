Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two years I waited for a great squeal to the force Awakens. Sadly I\u2019m left disappointed and felt this movie was more of a snl spoof. So many errors and dumb plots. Did Rian Johnson not see the other movies? Does he care? A nice lightsaber battle won\u2019t save this movie. Goodbye Star Wars. ","true":true}
