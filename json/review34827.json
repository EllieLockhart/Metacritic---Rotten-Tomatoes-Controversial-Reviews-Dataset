Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The ending is amazing and there are lots of great sequences and battles. However the humor is far too jokey and goofy for my taste. Star Wars has been fun in the past but only occasionally funny\\, this movie made jokes and did silly gags far too often. One of the plot lines is as far as I can tell useless to the overarching story; that's OK if the characters can carry the scenes and make it entertaining enough\\, however in this case the characters are not up to the challenge.
