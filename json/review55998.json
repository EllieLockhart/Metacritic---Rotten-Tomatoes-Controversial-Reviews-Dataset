Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Screw all the angry people. I'd consider myself a pretty good Star Wars fan and I was appalled when I walked out of the theater\\, feeling happy and blown away\\, only to see sooo much backlash. This is a great film and I was kept breathless almost all the way through. I thought that the casino part was a fresh breath of air from all the depressing Jedi and first order stuff. It was vibrant and cool and I don't agree with people saying it was \\\"pointless\\\". Sure it was stirred up by Poe Dameron being missinformed by Holdo (which is a controversy in of itself) but it gave way for some interesting set pieces\\, the introduction of the codebreaker\\, character development of Rose and the stable boy Jedi kid\\, and it was\\, as I already said\\, a cool change of pace. I literally held my breath when the ship was cut in half by lightspeed and when Snoke was just killed. Seriously. Some people think that it's dumb that Snoke was killed so abruptly and \\\"stupidly\\\"\\, but I think it's awesome. We knew nothing about him and he's... dead?! It was like a slap in the face and the pain and exhilaration didn't go away until Rey and Kilo were done making kababs out of the red guard guys. All in all\\, I loved this movie and I would consider it one of the best Star Wars films. People need to take off the \\\"If it's different\\, it's bad\\\" goggles and respect this film. It's great","true":true}
