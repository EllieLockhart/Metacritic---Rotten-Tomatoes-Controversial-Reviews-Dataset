Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not huge on reviews for movies as everyone has different taste in entertainment. Being a Star Wars fan\\, I was let down by a number of items. **Spoilers ahead** The \\\"Flight of Leia\\\" was a joke and the killing of two could be major characters without explanation was a completer letdown from the director\/writer. There was little to no character development in this film except that of Luke and his character didn't so much develope but regressed. Only redeeming quality for this particular flashback scene was that it played well into \\\"fear leads to the dark side of the force.\\\"  There were a number of pointless scenes (ie the casino) which offer zero story progression.  From a cinematic perspective\\, I thought it was enjoyable.  If it did not have the Star Wars name to it\\, people would not be nearly as upset as they are. I just hope that episode IX can undo some of the bad decisions made in this film.","true":true}
