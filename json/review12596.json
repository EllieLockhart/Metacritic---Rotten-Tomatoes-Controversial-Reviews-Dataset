Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't help but feel a little sad about how disappointed I was when I left the theater on Thursday night. I gave a day to think about and see if it would grow on me after the initial disappointment. Sadly that's not the case. This film did not feel like Star Wars to me whatsoever. It didn't feel epic like Star Wars (even the prequels felt large in scope). First\\, the things I disliked about it. The writing felt messy. There were to many instances of forced humor which felt terribly cheesy. Luke's character was completely bastardized. The Finn & Rose subplot was a complete waste of time. Not to mention the Leia arc at the beginning of the film\\, which ultimately led up to one of the most embarrassing moments of the entire franchise. There were also some things I liked\\, which save my score a little bit. The (one and only) lightsaber fight in the film was very nice. Reminded me of some classic samurai films in the way that it was choreographed. I liked seeing Yoda\\, as out-of-place as it felt to me. Overall\\, a very underwhelming experience for me. I hope other fans can find more to like about it than I did though. I just feel like I watched a different movie than the critics did. ","true":true}
