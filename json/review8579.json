Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all\\, I was entertained. That being said\\, I was also very disappointed based upon the history of Star Wars and all that has been shown in those movies thus far. They have always made attempts to connect one film to the next. That approach has abruptly ended with The Last Jedi. So many opportunities lost with this film.***Part 2*** 12\/19 - I just viewed the film this evening for the 2nd time. i was once again entertained. I also felt that while I won't forgive the sins of the movie\\, I won't discredit the attributes of it either. Therefore\\, I am adjusting my original rating of 1.5 stars up to 3 stars. Its not a great film\\, but not a trainwreck either. ","true":true}
