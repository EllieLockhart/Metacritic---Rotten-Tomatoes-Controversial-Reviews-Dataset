Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went into this very excited. Left quite underwhelmed.  While the story in a larger view is quite simple; stop Kylo Ren and save the resistance\\, the way it gets there is all over the place. Luke Skywalker might as well not even be in the movie. Leia\\, who never exitbited a force power has an incredibly powerful one... she uses once with no explanation.  Force Powers are barely used outside of the one just mentioned; other than the obligatory \\\"light sabre grab\\\" trick that is ubiquitous in all the movies. Light saber battles are barely existent and plodding when they happen. Their is one short-lived space battle worth noting\\, the few others are lame. Plot holes are the story of the day. Finn serves no purpose to the plot\\, Luke serves no purpose to the plot\\, Rose serves no purpose to the plot (save pulling at the most trite and formulaic heart strings. Wish I had the $40 I spent to go with my 2 boys and just waited to it to be released on Blu-Ray.\\nThis movie is overrated beyond any other in the franchise. And yes\\, that includes Phantom Menace. Keyword is overrated as this movie is a 6\/10 at best.","true":true}
