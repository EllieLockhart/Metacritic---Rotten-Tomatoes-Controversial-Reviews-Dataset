Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good: It was uncommonly beautiful.  It looked and sounded like Star Wars to me\\, much like 7 did.\\n\\nThe bad: The story was beyond awful - it was destructive.  Whoever wrote this film managed to turn Star Wars from the most \\\"must see\\\" series in history into just another sci fi that I'll likely be too busy to watch in the future.  The public loves Star Wars because of the characters and their epic good\/evil struggle.  This movie fails to develop new characters effectively\\, while viciously deconstructing older characters needlessly.  It's as though the writers were so intent on flippantly assassinating the old story that they forgot to develop a compelling new one.\\n\\nI never thought I'd say this\\, but the prequels don't look so bad now.  I'll take awkward pacing\/acting any day over story homicide.  It's quite possible I'll give 9 and beyond a miss.  I'm still hopeful about the Han Solo movie though...","true":true}
