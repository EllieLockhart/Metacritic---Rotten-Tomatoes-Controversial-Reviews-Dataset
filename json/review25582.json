Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a die hard fan... may be that's why I didn't get pissed off because of this movie... I liked almost everything here (spoilers) especially the way they ended Luke's journey it made me cry a bit. however the plot could have moved a little faster...","true":true}
