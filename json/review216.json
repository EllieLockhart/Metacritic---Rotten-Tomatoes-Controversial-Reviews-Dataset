Whatever the case may be\\, this game has an excellent cast\\, the gameplay is great (although I prefer Yakuza Kiwami 2 and Yakuza 6 on that end) and if you like single player games with good and long stories and sometimes really funny sidequests: this is for you. Have fun playing and don\u2019t forget: Yakuza Kiwami 1&2 and Yakuza 6 are available on PS4 with Yakuza 3\\, 4 and 5 remasters expected in non too long. I\u2019m guestimating that\u2019ll be 7 times 25 (175) hours of gameplay easy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
