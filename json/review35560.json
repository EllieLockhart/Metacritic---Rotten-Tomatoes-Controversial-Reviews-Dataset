Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a beautiful film and wonderful story. Go in with no expectations\\, Ryan Johnson is telling a story that isn't going to go the way you think. The directing\\, acting\\, screenwriting\\, special effects and cinematography were all absolutely top notch. \\n\\nAdam Driver's performance really stands out\\, and Daisy Ridley is every as wonderful in this film as The Force Awakens. The emotional journeys their two characters go on is very well portrayed.\\n\\nCarrie Fisher's final performance is powerful and touching. I was riveted by her every moment she was on the screen.\\n\\nAs a lifelong Star Wars fan I was very satisfied\\, and am confident the future films are in good hands.","true":true}
