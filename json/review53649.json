Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flynn could have been removed from both movies and they would have played out the same. The amount of Deus Ex Machina in every situation gives very little purpose because most characters are entirely protected by plot. There is no gravity to their actions  The only actual likable character has such little motivation and growth that she is borderline likable purely because she does cool shit once in a while.","true":true}
