Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill was right to disagree with Rian on this one. Rian ruined Luke (milking an alien anyone?) wasted hours on a pointless slow speed chase through space\\, included off tempo humor throughout- what can I say\\, other than it was a mess. The only redeeming qualities were the last 20 or so minutes\\, and the light saber duel with Rey and Kylo. I could have skipped the rest and gotten 2 or so hours of my life back. As a Star Wars fan\\, this is such a disappointment that I am not even interested in episode 9.","true":true}
