Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow....I never thought I would come across a Star Wars movie where I could care less what happens to its characters. Unfortunately\\, this movie falls flat in every category. But most of all\\, its characters are the least memorable part. Will I go see the next installment of this franchise? Most likely not since there is nothing interesting going on with these character's story arcs. ","true":true}
