Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What they did with Luke Skywalker was a disgrace...  Also the story was a complete let down.  It got to the right story place but in the wrong way.  The effects were great but the story just killed it for me.  Luke had to die but I wanted an heroic death and to boil out of the cinema wanting revenge\/redemption in the 3rd movie... I just wandered out bemused - feeling let down and depressed.  Serious waste of a great legacy.  A shame.","true":true}
