Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so damn tired of pessimists so I created an account just to say the following 6 things:\\n\\n1st\\nEvery time I've watched a big movie\\, reviews and articles flash in my stream\\, most of which are negative to the big movie. This applies not only to Star Wars but also to all other movies ... as well.\\n\\n2nd\\nIt's usually the same people who are negative to the latest big movies and positive to the 80's original\\, regardless of Star Wars or Star Trek. I have the following message to you:\\n\\n3rd\\nThen stop watching new movies. You do not like episode 1\\, episode 2\\, episode 3\\, episode 7\\, episode 8 - but maybe STAR WARS is nothing for you if you only like episodes 4-6 (original). Then you may not go around saying that you love STAR WARS and are \\\"fans.\\\" Then you may say \\\"I like the original but have trouble for new things\\\" and stop going on the new movies. You do not like The Last Jedi. No but then you can see The Last Jedi as a preview of the direction the concept takes\\, so do not go to the next movie because they will obviously continue the story of Rey and Finn. You are warned\\, Do not go on the next big movie because you will be disappointed. I'll save you money. Add the bio-prize to playing golf instead if you think it's more fun.\\n This also applies to Star Trek fans who do not like the new movies\\, no\\, but do not go to the new movie that comes in any year. stay in your 80's bubble.\\n\\n4th\\nI am committed to creating a concept for several books and animated films that I hope to become reality. You do not know how much work it is. And then our concept is just a grain of sand in comparison to STAR WARS. My profession has made me contact with people who work with DISNEY and other similar giants. Do you know how much work it enters into a project like a big movie. I can tell you that only the hair color of a character is a whole project. For God's grace of dark brown becomes too controversial for the \\\"fans\\\" instead of light brown ... You do not know how many hours they sat and discussed what speed the spacecraft would have for it to look realistic. You do not know how much the clothing designer worked with the shoes for one of the characters\\, because they knew the \\\"fans\\\" would be upset if the character had the wrong type of shoes. Many of those who work as new to Disney feel the press of making everything \\\"perfect\\\"\\, and then put down their entire wake up on this even though they are not getting paid anymore. Some hardly see their family just to make Rey's trackingdevice 'perfect'.\\n\\n5th\\nSo\\, instead of watching the movie as \\\"crap\\\"\\, you should appreciate the incredible work of long hours of parents who barely saw their children. Show that you appreciate their work even if you may not be a \\\"fan\\\" of that particular work. Even if you do not like vanilla\\, you can still like the ice cream car that also gives you the chocolate you love and show appreciation for the ice-cream driver even on the day the chocolate is not available and there's only vanilla. You do not go to the icecream car and say \\\"it was the worst shit I've ever been with\\\" just because vanilla is the only available icecream. You do not say to the driver that \\\"he should be hanged and never drive a icecream car again\\\" just because it became vanilla today? If you do\\, you should first get a life\\, then grab your life and then apologize to the driver and at least say \\\"I do not like vanilla but I appreciate your passing by\\\".\\n\\n6th\\nIt is clear that you can give criticism but give constructive criticism. If you necessarily feel that you have to be pessimistic and see all new movies\\, even though you know you will not like them\\, at least you can give constructive criticism (if you do not know what it means\\, GOOGLE it) instead of saying \\\"crap\\\". Then tell us how you think Disney should have done to make you happy while making the new generation happy. You know that generation that will continue as \\\"fans\\\" long after you're gone. You may have a complete script home that is worth billions. Then send it to me. I like to take that script ... Well\\, you have nothing. And if you have one\\, I'm honest to send it to me and I'll take it with me. Enter your email address and I will send a message to yours\\, Smiley wink ;-)\\n I listened to the \\\"fans\\\" once in a completely different project. It became a total FLOPP. Threats were sent to me. After that\\, I only listen to experts\\, advisors\\, etc. The truth is\\, you can not make everyone happy and if Disney were to listen to the fans\\, it would probably mean a \\\"flop\\\" for the new generation.","true":true}
