Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was rough..I mean if you have a movie with three primary story arcs and only one of them goes anywhere (just barely) than what is even being accomplished. There is a whole story arc that ends up having no baring on the plot in anyway and certain character choices left you baffled (not in a good way). I still haven't figured out what the story was supposed to be or what was even accomplished. This movie is a pure mess and gets 1.5 stars on the sheer strength on the impressive visuals and good music (albeit recycled music. If you're on the fence about seeing this\\, don't.","true":true}
