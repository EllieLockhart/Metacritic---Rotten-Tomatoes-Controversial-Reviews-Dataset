Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"cast\\, they really blew it.\\n-bullshit opening scene \\n-Leia flying back into the ship after she should have died\\n-What is Fin's role in this movie. It would have been more meaningful if he sacr ificed himself.\\n-making Poe Dameron look like a moron the whole movie\\n-casino scene\\n-Fin\/Rose subplot\\n-what was the point of snoke?\\n-plot is so predictable\\, it is almost insulting. Honestly\\, was this movie written by a 5 year old?","true":true}
