Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a Kylo Ren tantrum bad.\\n\\nWho knew that the Star Wars franchise could actually worsen from the ill reviews\/ratings it received from the prequels? \\nTLJ has no sense of direction just pure ridiculous lazy writing\\, no backbone what so ever. It irks me how these kind of stories are the one being aired in the cinemas nowadays. At least the prequels had a decent story to back up the world created by the OT it just needed to be polished off from George Lucas. This shit tho is garbage. How or why the critics are rating this high and even have the audacity to say it's as best as ESB is bs. I feel sorry for Mark Hamill he endured this mess for the last 2 years. He even warned us about how pathetic the writing was yet he was a good sport to do this. He deserves so much better than this.  \\n\\nI guess it's time to say goodbye and mourn for my favorite saga. It has had a good run.\\n\\np.s. To those who are saying that the people who rate this movie low are the people who dont accept total change and","true":true}
