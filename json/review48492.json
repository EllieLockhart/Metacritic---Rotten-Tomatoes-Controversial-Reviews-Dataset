Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With this film Star Wars has lost all it's remaining value to me. Its a total cash in for random celebrities to attach their names to\\, and I'm done paying to watch the popular kids party on screen at the expense of something that was once special. \\n\\nA few things that ended it for me. \\n1. Snokes weak death. He was built up to be so powerful and killed off easily. \\n2. The comedy. I love to laugh\\, but the timing for the humor was just off. They often created a serious moment then ruined it with immature humor. \\n3. Leia's ridiculous flight made my eyes roll so hard. \\n\\nPlus there are several plot holes others have already pointed out. We had ?? over our heads the entire film. Not the good type though. \\n\\nI'll do my best to steer my friends away from this wreck.","true":true}
