Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually captivating! Plot is pretty bad yet I still think it\u2019s worth watching once. Attempting to rewatch it\\, however\\, I find it somewhat painful. A lot \u201cDisney\u201d moments that are rather embarrassing and characters that are just annoying. Would\u2019ve loved if Luke\u2019s character development was... more like Luke. That said\\, there\u2019s some good humor here and there and again\\, great visuals. Fortunately\\, Rise of Skywalker saved us all.","true":true}
