Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it ironically bots downvoting this? Because it\u2019s not bad at all. Delivers in every way you want it to and some ways that make you shout out loud with anguish. It\u2019s one hell of a movie!","true":true}
