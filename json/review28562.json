Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the best SW since the \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\". Excelent writing\\, awesome epic shots\\, the costumes and CGI are\\, of course\\, out of this world. The story is also good\\, acting and characters are well written\\, and by far the best humor in all of the SW franchise.","true":true}
