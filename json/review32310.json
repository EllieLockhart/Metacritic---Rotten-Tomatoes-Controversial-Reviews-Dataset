Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has been an American household staple for decades. I grew up having fond memories of watching the original trilogy with my dad\\, and I'll always cherish those memories of losing myself in an epic drama of space battles and good versus evil. However\\, The Last Jedi follows the trend of another American pastime\\, football\\, in that it's been crushed by outside politics. This movie did not come across as a Star Wars film\\, but instead a piece of third-wave feminist literature about the evils of man. If you thought the prequels were bad\\, prepare to be amazed.\\n\\nSpoiler alert\\, so stop reading now if you haven't seen the film and are still considering it.\\n\\nLeia became Space Mary Poppins and can apparently regenerate faster than wolverine with no plot explanation. \\n\\nCommander what's-her-name's dialogue pretty much boils down to \\\"I'm a woman\\, I'm in charge\\, be quiet and obey because you clearly don't know what you're doing\\\"\\, while at the same time she refuses to communicate with her command staff\\, because she's apparently more concerned about one upping Poe than actually surviving. Bad writing for someone who is supposed to be a general\\, and if it weren't for her noble sacrifice at the end\\, you'd be convinced she was more of a Gender Studies major who settled for a middle management position. \\n\\nThe first order is relegated the role of a Nazi caricature. Kylo Ren and his new best mate get relegated to the role of slapstick comedians\\, which is interesting considering that he's supposed to be the source of ultimate Evil in the galaxy. Luke Skywalker's characterization was also poor\\, as his underlying philosophy was that he'd rather die than kill somebody if they had the slightest spark of good in them. This was seen in the case of Darth Vader. Put into that context\\, his behavior towards Kylo Ren was entirely out of the norm\\, something that he simply would not do. Luke was transformed from a hero into a coward.\\n\\nRose interrupts Finn's self-sacrifice\\, because apparently love is the answer to all problems\\, and in doing so allows the first order to blow open their base's front door\\, tanking the Rebellion\\, drawing out Luke Skywalker and leading to his death. In the end\\, the movie's tone endorsed her as a hero because it fit the narrative that was being pushed by the directors\\, even though her actions were objectively selfish. She wanted Finn alive\\, choosing him over the Rebellion she swore to serve. What should have been a controversial decision was not praised as such or even recognized. \\n\\nAll of the females in this story had Mary Sue status\\, straight up. They're all knowing\\, all wise\\, funny and caring. They don't make mistakes\\, if they do make a mistake the plot somehow works out to their favor\\, they're unrealistically strong or skilled\\, and rather than being a conflicted\\, human character\\, they come across as 2D forces of nature instead. They are portrayed as infallible heroes\\, incapable of making mistakes\\, whom we should all aspire to be like. On the other hand\\, all of the men were presented as self-serving\\, filled with hate\\, ignorant\\, or some combination of the three. This includes everyone from Kylo\\, to Poe\\, to Finn\\, and even Luke-freaking-skywalker. Not so coincidentally\\, all of these characters had their hero card revoked\\, and were ultimately 'redeemed' and shown the error of their ways by the women of the series\\, but only after being relegated to the backseat.\\n\\nTake into account the director and many of his creative staff\\, who took to social media talking about how the first order is actually a white supremacist organization and the movie was designed to showcase diversity and push feminist values\\, and you come to the conclusion that the movie was heavily politicized. Combine that with poor writing\\, and you have a political hackjob of a script that's designed to appease feminists and preach to everyone else\\, rather than a film that stays true to the essence of the franchise. It's no surprise that this film was not well received among the public\\, even if the critics enjoyed it.","true":true}
