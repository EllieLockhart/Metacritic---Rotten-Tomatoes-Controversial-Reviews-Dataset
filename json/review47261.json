Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What ashame\\, complete garbage compared to the originals.\\nQuality speaks for itself\\, the directors should be embarrassed . The argument of creative difference is a complete justification for lack of vision and overall incompetence. The movie is filled with moral relativism\\, where wrong and right are comingled in a twisted portrayal.\\n\\nSad\\, just sad. I wished they would have never sold the rights.","true":true}
