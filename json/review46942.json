Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a curious film. On one hand I liked some of the set pieces\\,I thought the effects were great\\, the film however was let down buy some sloppy plot holes  that made the characters seem like idiots on both sides. The films twists were acceptable if unexpected but  the direction they sent the story in have me less than enthused for the next chapter in the series.","true":true}
