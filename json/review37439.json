Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are few really good moments but also a few awkward ones.\\nSadly interesting things are undone in following scenes. The main impression I've got are wasted opportunities and a mess.","true":true}
