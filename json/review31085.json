Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So it's still a Star Wars movie\\, but too many gaping plot holes and some jumping of the shark makes this movie cringeworthy at many times.  Some of the twists I thought were great\\, but executed poorly.  Many elements of this movie exist because they have to in order for it to make sense and even then it requires suspension of disbelief at times.  And then there's THAT ONE SCENE.","true":true}
