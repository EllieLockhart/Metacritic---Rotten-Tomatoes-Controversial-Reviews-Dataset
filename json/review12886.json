Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I disliked the movie. I appreciate that others liked it\\, and I don't want to ruin it for anyone\\, but I personally hated the movie and haven't been able to watch any other star wars movies since seeing it. I don't think I am going to see episode 9 unless I am convinced that it will make me enjoy star wars again.","true":true}
