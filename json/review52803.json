Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of expectations surrounded this movie and as a Star Wars fan from the beginning\\, I think this movie lived up to the hype. I was impressed with the writing and how the story kept me guessing. I could not predict what would happen next. Always held my interest and I think it really was true o the characters. Luke's story arc was very satisfying and true to the character. Leia's character was very well done and a fitting tribute. There was a good mixture of action\\, story\\, Jedi philosophy\\, and growth in the characters. I found it immensely satisfying as a Star Wars film and I think it ranks as one of the best Star Wars films ever made. Well worth seeing as a good stand alone movie in its own right. It keeps the feel of the franchise while moving the experience forward and growing on what had already been done. A great movie experience.","true":true}
