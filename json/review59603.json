Ok\\, we understand that Joel killer her father and that she wanted revenge but we could have started the game with Abby\u2019s story and experience her father\u2019s death with her so we like her from the beginning\\, so that when she kills Joel we can at least understand at first why she did that\\, but why have Joel killed from the third hour of the game and have us hating on Abby so much then forcing us to play with her (and helping Lev and his sister sh*t won\u2019t make us love her\\, this was just a waste of time) We should have stopped playing with Abby right after Joel\u2019s death and continue with Ellie then meet her at the end of the game or something so we have hate built up towards her (that\u2019s after loving her from the beginning of the game) and Joel\u2019s death scene could have been so much more emotional\\, come on naughty dog. The story felt like it was written by a kid who hates Joel so much and didn\u2019t want to play with Ellie anymore.Graphics could have been better in my opinion and there is a lot of glitches throughout the story that disrupts the experience even more.I wish they didn\u2019t make this sequel as it ruins the first one for everyone.I still love naughty dog and still think they are one of the best game developers out there\\, but they just didn\u2019t go right with this one. Sorry.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
