Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really beautifully filmed with excellent performances from the cast. Many genuine surprises and heart-warming callbacks to the history of Star Wars.  Made by a fan for fans but not afraid to chart new territory.  I think if you go into it expecting it to be one thing or you are too hung up on your own theories or what Star Wars has been until now\\, that you may be disappointed.  However\\, you'd be missing all the beautiful places it goes and can go after this film.  This film has great performances by Hamill\\, Fisher\\, Ridley\\, Driver et al.  It does justice to Leia and I believe to Luke as well.  It acknowledges that things change over 40 years since we first met them\\, yet essentially they remain defenders of the Light and against tyranny.  I also love the new characters and their development\\, particularly Rey.","true":true}
