Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold step in the right direction for the saga. Is it perfect? Of course not. No film is. But I can't deny that this movie pleasantly surprised me on almost every level\\, took many risks with characters and story elements\\, and took the story in a new\\, fresh direction. While I do have issues with some of the supporting characters like DJ\\, and the Canto Bight storyline\\, they don't detract from my overall enjoyment of the film. As a sequel\\, I think The Last Jedi does the right thing. In other words\\, it doesn't repeat the plot of the first film\\, it puts the characters through challenges\\, and it ends in a way that leaves the story open to endless new possibilities. But\\, I still don't understand the blind hatred for this film. I liked it. Is it the best? Nope. Empire Strikes Back will always hold that title. Is it the worst? Hell no! It's easily more bearable than The Holiday Special\\, which is beyond cringe worthy. But\\, overall\\, The Last Jedi's biggest strength lies not in the action\\, or the visuals\\, but the fact that it made me think. It's probably the most thought provoking film in the saga. And that's the highest compliment I can give it. And in case you're wondering what my ranking of the franchise is\\, here you go: 1: The Empire Strikes Back= A+ 2: Star Wars= A+ 3: Return of the Jedi= B+ 4: The Last Jedi= A 5: The Force Awakens= A 6: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story= B 7: Revenge of the Sith= C+ 8: The Phantom Menace= D- 9: Attack of the Clones= D 10: The Star Wars Holiday Special= F","true":true}
