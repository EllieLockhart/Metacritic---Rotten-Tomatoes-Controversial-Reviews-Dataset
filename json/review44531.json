Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total crap movie\\, avoid at all costs. Hey Disney thanks to you im done with Star Wars and I have been a fan since day 1 May 25 1977!","true":true}
