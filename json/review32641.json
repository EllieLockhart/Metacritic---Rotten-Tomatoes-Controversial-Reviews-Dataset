Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is definitely one of my favorite films of the franchise. This is what I call a huge fan service to people who love Star Wars as it has a great story that delivers emotional weight\\, with great acting\\, especially from Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Daisy Ridley\\, & Adam Driver. With a film that's 152 minutes\\, trust me\\, you'll be kept entertained with the amazing action this film has too. \\nGrade: A","true":true}
