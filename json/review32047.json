{"101487":169484,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-13","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***SPOILERS***\\n\\nI saw Episode IV in 1977 and consider it the best of them all.\\n\\nWhere to begin with this turd.\\n\\nI get it\\, it's sci-fi fantasy.  But there's a level of reality that must be kept otherwise why not have all the characters flying around like space angel Leia shooting space angel love beams at each other.  This movie crosses that line multiple times.\\n\\nRose\\, I believe her first line is \\\"I fix pipes\\\"\\, then goes on to piloting spaceships and fighters. Apparently in that galaxy far far away pilots are not in great need because every lowly shlub can pilot. Very uninteresting character.\\n\\nFinn\\, no wonder the first order is doomed\\, everyone in that organisation from high to low knows all their secrets\\, secret codes\\, when the codes change\\, how often they change\\, layout of ships\\, how to navigate through ships\\, weaknesses of ships.  I Like the character\\, but honestly what role would a once lowly stormtrooper have after joining the rebellion other than being their version of a ground pounder.\\n\\nRaye\\, she's just a hobo and with no training squares off with multiple personal guards of Snoke\\, and wins. Just a repeat of the last movie where she takes on Ren\/Ben and bests him. Like the actress and character\\, just needs more attention to detail.\\n\\nKylo Ren\/Ben\\, most uninteresting main bad guy ever. Really whiney\\, kind of like young Vader. Hux was more interesting\\, Tarkin was more interesting and his only memorable line was \\\"you may fire when ready\\\". I actually fist pumped when Snoke yelled at him to take that stupid mask off...I couldn't understand a word he was saying.\\n\\nLuke\\, thought Hamill did a good job.\\n\\nBenecio Del Toro\\, good character\\, reminds me of the kind of people Han Solo would run around with except maybe a step or two worse.\\n\\nFairly dopey and uninspiring speeches scattered throughout in an attempt to bolster morale\\, some painful to listen to.\\n\\nSome funny parts\\, some parts tried to be funny but were lame.  Whoever came up with the holding for Hux part should be punched in the face repeatedly and never allowed near a Star Wars movie again.\\n\\nThe movie breaks down into 3 boss battles\\, there should really only be one:\\n\\nFirst\\, dreadnought is destroyed by level bombers...in space.  last I heard bombs don't drop in space.  They've managed to figure out how to travel at the speed of light but not how to create stand-off fire and forget missles.\\n\\nSecond\\, battering ram\\, happens to take just enough time to charge up so the heroes can swoop in to destroy it...except miracle pilot Rose stopped it from happening\\, can't have Finn dead and she managed to survive too.\\n\\nThird\\, Snokes giant ship and the entire first order fleet wiped out by Laura the miracle general\/pilot Dern.  Advice to rebellion\\, just make drones out of your giant ships and hyperspace them through your enemies...saves lives.  Don't worry\\, you can move your people around in cloaked dinghies because that's apparently a widely available technology\\, not sure why everyone doesn't use it if you can put it on dopey escape shuttles.\\n\\nAt what point do the bad guys go \\\"Hey\\, I've noticed everything we build gets vaporized due to some stupid design flaw\\, lets focus on fixing that\\\"?\\n\\nApparently the movie is an advertisement for PETA\\, SJW and child trafficking. Poor animals\\, people are so evil.  Poor kids\\, evil adults\\, someone cue up Randy Watson singing children are our future. Female characters\\, evil males get put in their place\\, hell even Poe gets slapped.  What the creators did is blatantly obvious.  Because it's obvious that makes it forced and unconvincing.  If they didn't try so hard then it might have worked.  Back in 1977 before all this nonsense\\, Leia was a great female character in episode IV.  You thought \\\"Oh a princess needing saved\\\"\\, then quickly came to realize she was much more.  Now every female in the movie has to try to be a tough guy.\\n\\nMy intention was not to see the movie just so I could be that guy. I could say I'll do it for the next movie but who am I kidding\\, it's Star Wars.","true":true}
