Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reason Star Wars because the gigantic franchise that it was today was because it mastered the art of creating a completely new world for people to get lost in. The Star Wars we grew up with had so many systems\\, civilisations\\, ways of life and rich characters to love.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi does not do any of this.\\n\\nInstead\\, what Disney is doing with the series is replacing the world-building with endless montages of cheap climaxes. Mind you that they are fun to watch at first\\, but they leave you empty and bitter afterwards because they were just cheap thrills that actually destroy the world that Star Wars is built upon. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi resembles more of a cheesy soap opera than the science fiction epic that was the pre-Disney Star Wars. That is why fans absolutely hate this movie and what Disney is doing with the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
