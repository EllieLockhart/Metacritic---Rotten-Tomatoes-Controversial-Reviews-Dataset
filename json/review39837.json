Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Star Wars film that was not made for Star Wars fans. The level of agenda pushing greatly detracts from the plot. Additionally not a single thread from ep 8 was continued in any meaningful way. I will not be seeing ep 9 or the Han Solo movie. Make sure not to rate less than 1 star or Rotten Tomatoes ignores your rating everyone.","true":true}
