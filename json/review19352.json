Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's over Johnny nothing to look forward to\\, what a terrible way to lose the most important Jedi should have a least kept Luke alive one more movie very disappointed.","true":true}
