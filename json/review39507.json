Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film takes everything promised by the previous film and rips it up under the pretext of \\\"surprising\\\" the audience. The absence of expected revelations\\, combined with lacklustre plots and new characters that seem entirely 1 dimensional make this the worst stars film so far. It's as if Disney were so scared by criticism that Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope that they tried to distance themselves from it so much in this one that they took away everything that was Star Wars\\, and forgot to set themselves up episode IX. There are a couple of visually spectacular scenes - but the subversion and plotholes to get to them mean that they don't come close to saving the movie.","true":true}
