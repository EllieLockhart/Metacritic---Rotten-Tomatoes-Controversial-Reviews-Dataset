{"101487":164514,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really\\, it has all been said\\, hasn't it\\, and more eloquently than I can express it. But failure is\\, I guess\\, not a teacher\\, since no one seems to be listening\\, so here we go again.\\n\\n(Can't risk the review not being counted\\, so it gets one star\\, but if I could I'd give it below zero.)\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is an exercise in disappointment.\\n\\nWere you excited to see Luke's return? Too bad\\, he's unrecognizable\\, to the point no passage of years can explain. Diverse cast? Too bad\\, Finn and Rose are shoved in a pointless sideplot\\, and Poe gets turned into a stereotype and humiliated. Were you looking forward to Holdo being a strong female leader? Too bad\\, her leadership sucks\\, and makes things abysmal for the Resistance. Rey's journey? Too bad\\, turns out this is not her story after all. There is no hero's journey\\, she learns nothing because apparently she doesn't need to\\, she does not accomplish anything and she is left out of the climax\\, which is pretty telling.\\n\\nBeyond that though. Were you expecting Snoke's backstory? Anything? Too bad. Rey's parentage to be satisfying and make everything make sense? Too bad. Leia to be badass? Too bad\\, here have a Mary Poppins scene. Han's death to have an impact? Too bad\\, here have some dice.\\n\\nWere you expecting to see the same characters\\, and for the situation at the start of the movie to be the same as the end of The Force Awakens? Too damn bad. It's like the director didn't even watch the Force Awakens\\, or\\, to be frank\\, any other Star Wars film. But that can't be right\\, because there's scenes lifted right out of other movies\\, like Return of the Jedi\\, only without any logical explanation and void of any of the emotion and meaning that made the scenes work in the first place.\\n\\nIt is heart-breaking. For a fan of Luke Skywalker\\, like me\\, it is downright depressing. Likewise for fans of the new main cast\\, who wanted the characters to have satisfying arcs.\\n\\nOne character does have a better arc than the others\\, though. The movie has an irrational\\, alarming need to make us empathize with Kylo Ren\\, patricidal space fascist (and this being Star Wars\\, it's very concerning). To do that\\, they have to destroy Luke's character and make Rey forget the torture and pain Kylo has caused the three mains in the very recent past. And in the end\\, the only thing that's proven is that Kylo is just bad. Like no one knew that when he murdered his own father. What was the use of Han dying then\\, if not to show just how far gone Kylo is? None\\, and his death feels that much more unnecessary and infuriating for it.\\n\\nApart from all that\\, the humour was ill-timed and not particularly funny. The action tried\\, but the movie doesn't manage to draw you in so it's empty. The visuals really tried\\, but what is even the point anymore. At least the Porgs are cute\\, right?\\n\\nThere is nothing truly good about this movie. Its faux feminism\\, steeped in out-of-touch or outright misogynistic tropes\\, racist undertones evident in the arcs of the characters of colour\\, and obvious disdain for what came before it ensure that\\, even as its own plot is paper thin and it contradicts its own internal logic. It takes a space fairytale and turns it into a grimdark\\, post-modern mess with no room for hope or heroes.\\n\\nI'm not an old fan. The movie didn't destroy my love for Star Wars\\, but only because there was no prior love there to be tainted. No\\, what it destroyed was my excitement going forward. If that's all I can expect from Star Wars\\, there simply is nothing for me there. Thanks but no thanks\\, what came before is enough.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is empty\\, with no substance. It has no heart\\, and no soul\\, caring for neither its characters nor the audience\\, nor the larger\\, rich universe it's set in. That's not Star Wars.","true":true}
