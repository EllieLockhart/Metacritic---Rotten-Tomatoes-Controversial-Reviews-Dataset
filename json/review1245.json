Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apparently the only training you need to be a Jedi Knight is be born. Lea can fly through space? Luke has been replaced with a cowardly no caring selfish turd and makes no sense. Lame jokes and a clear attempt to please every demographic. This movie was bad\\, really bad. ","true":true}
