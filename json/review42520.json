Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a mess. I have loved Star Wars since I was a little kid and even when I didn't love the movies\\, I at least enjoyed them and could appreciate them. This movie was riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies and gave the general impression that whoever wrote it had never seen a Star Wars movie before. They spent too much time trying to create plot twists to keep the audience on their toes and not enough time just crafting a good story. I could rant about how bad this thing was for pages but I won't.","true":true}
