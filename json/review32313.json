Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has been eviscerated and my childhood love of the saga destroyed. While I was hopeful and excited by Rogue One and the Force Awakens\\, my reignited hopes to share Star Wars with my daughter are over. This movie made the prequels look like the Empire Strikes Back. What a F.....G DISASTER! ","true":true}
