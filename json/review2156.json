Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"at 40 years of age.. I'm much to old to lie to myself and make up excuses for its short comings. or do mental gymnastics trying to convince myself that there was anything special at all in this movie. because there is not. but in all honesty not being special in today's Hollywood is a very forgivable offense. as 8 out of 10 movies being released to theaters aren't even worth watching. but this film was worse than not being special. franchise history this film was just bad for a star wars movie. it was just a bad movie period. and almost all the blame lands on the writers\/director's head. with casting being the only other deserving of blame","true":true}
