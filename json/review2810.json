Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie. Rian Johnson tries too hard to create twists in the plot\\, but they all end up being pointless as they take the story into the same direction it would have gone had the twists not been there to begin with.\\n\\nSome new and interesting concepts were introduced but ultimately thrown out the window by the end of the movie. Unfortunately\\, the majority of this film ended up being a rehash of \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" mixed with \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\"\\, but without any significant character\/story development.","true":true}
