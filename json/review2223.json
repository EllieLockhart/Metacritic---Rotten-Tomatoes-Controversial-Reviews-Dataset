Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A thrilling sequel to Star Wars: The force awakens and long awaited\\, only to fall extremely short of almost everything that makes it \\\"Star Wars.\\\" The movie had ever slightly better pacing and even worst dialogue. The movie focuses on a more comedic aspect and falls short even on that note and even kills off one of the better characters only for that to fail the audience as a beloved character doesn't receive a death he deserves. The only good thing are the visuals and the fact Star Wars is in the title\\, oh and don't forgot the laser swords that can be so easily learned that anyone could do it..","true":true}
