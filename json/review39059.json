Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thin story. Even more so than what you'd expect in a journey to Star Wars book that precedes theses Disney movies. As a stand alone movie it would be okay but definitely doesn't work as a continuation of what Abrams did. Considering it's part 8 of a 9 part story it would be like if Rowling turned Harry Potter over someone to do what every they wanted with for book 6. With this movie Rian ruined the 9 part story in a way Lucas even didn't with Jar Jar\\, bad acting\\, and poor dialogue.","true":true}
