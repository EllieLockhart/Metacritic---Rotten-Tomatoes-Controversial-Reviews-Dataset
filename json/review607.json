Not to be nitpicky\\, but after going through a game with terrific character development and twists and turns\\, plus ambiguous conclusions that ask you to make judgments (internally) on the measure of a person\\, you may miss some of the details that would have you scratching head throughout the game.\r\rFor example\\, the mansion where the plot begins and ends is built in the shadow of a sanitarium and mine.  On the way to the mansion you pass kiosks with signage that looks like you're entering a national park.  Who in their right mind issued the permits for the mansion to be built? How does the damn thing have a pipe drainage system and modern water systems in an area that was recently closed\\, and which probably hasn't had the time to be properly ecologically restored. Who would drink piped water from the local water stream\\, for christ's sake that damn thing is probably full of tailings and leached metals from the mine. What're they thinking building a damn mansion there?\r\rMoreover\\, when we find out about the Wendigo\\, are you telling me that for the whole year\\, year and a half of construction (if not more due to its remoteness) that no construction member ever saw\\, much less be attacked by the Wendigo? Or see Flamethrower Guy attack one? And nobody check out the Sanitarium and see any of the Wendigos? Or that the construction were diligent about getting off site by sundown in a construction site that means that either a.) they got in a gondola for a good long trip to the mountain\\, which at most could seat 12 at a time\\, everyday for work or b.) lived on site to cut down on the distance. BTW\\, when they were setting up building materials for the mansion\\, not a single Wendigo attack\\, at all? I'm beginning to think these Wendigos are highly particular\\, bet none of the construction crew was hot enough for these hell beasts.\r\rStill\\, if you can look past the OBVIOUS lapse in building permitting\\, the fact that the government allowed a mansion on national park land\\, that the homeowner does not care about his kids as utilizing water systems would probably do irreparable harm to their health mental and physical\\, the very particular foraging behavior of the Wendigos\\, you will have yourself a good time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
