Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Great graphics\\, gameplay remains almost the same as the first game\\, but the biggest issue\\, as so many have already mentioned\\, the story is poop. Just awful.\r\rThe way they massacred Joel's character... why would he suddenly trust a bunch of strangers like that... It made no sense. And please\\, don't tell me it's because he's mellowed out after those years living peacefully. That is just dumb storytelling.\rI don't know. It just feels like a whole waste of a game. None of the new characters are interesting\\, because they barely get any meaningful development\\, and they suddenly they die in some bs way. Abby\\, the second protagonist\\, is straightup a psychopath and is impossible to sympathize with. Yeah sure\\, she helps children and pets a dog\\, woohoo\\, but that doesn't erase the fact that she murders people in cold blood and shows 0 remorse (unlike Ellie).\r\rMan\\, I don't know\\, i'm just sad\\, waited 7 years for this. What a letdown\\, what a waste\\, what an awful unsatisfying ending\\, what a dumb story\\, what a dumb cast of characters.... whatever\\, screw naughty dog\\, screw the people that thought this story was acceptable.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
