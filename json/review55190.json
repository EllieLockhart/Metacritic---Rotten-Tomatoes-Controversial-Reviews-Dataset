{"101487":147625,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would give this 0.0 out of 5.0 if I could.. I am in disbelief that the Last Jedi could've been so TERRIBLE! There was so much wrong with this massive disaster. I watched in horror at the bastardization of Star Wars Saga. The acting was horrible\\, the dialogue as poorly written as the Attack of the Clones\\, Hayden and Jar Jar Binks owe you a debt of gratitude for creating worse characters that the prequels. Just look at that dumb purple haired moron that got everyone killed. This the world you created when women run the show? How exactly do you run out of gas? What's with the Casino subplot? It was a mind-numbing waste of 30 minutes. Rose and Finn story-line was a complete joke. Where did you find these \\\"actors\\\" The opening scene with General Hux is a buffoon. Who've wrote this script should never work again. The director Rian Johnson you are a HUGE asshole and should be sent away to a galaxy far far away. Girl Power got everyone killed and the beta-males were pathetic losers. CPT Phasma haha come on man really not only is she a terrible villain she dies just as pathetically as Snoke. Disney and Johnson you really are a bunch of scruffy looking Nerf herders and made Star Wars into a Joke way to ruin a franchise you greedy pricks. Force Awakens sucked just as much with the exception of Harrison Ford and yet you killed off Han Solo the only good part of that movie.","true":true}
