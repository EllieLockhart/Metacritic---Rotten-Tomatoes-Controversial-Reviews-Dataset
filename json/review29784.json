Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Riddled with plot holes\\, villians are shallow and lack menace\\, good guys are equally lacking in substance and don't seem to have a goal or.mission. there's a full half hour excursion that could be entirely cut and the film would lose nothing. I wish the good guys had all died so it would be over and we wouldn't be subjected to a third film. Seriously\\, do not waste your time or money.","true":true}
