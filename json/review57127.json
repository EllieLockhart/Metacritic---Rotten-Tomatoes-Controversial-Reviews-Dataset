Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my best shot at a fair review.\\n\\nThis movie has the biggest plot twist since The Empire Strikes back\\, speaking specifically of Kylo killing Snoke. A brilliant story line and cinematics. I have probably 8 favorite parts in this movie. I really want to give this movie 5 stars because it does deserve it. It's perfect in every aspect above and beyond what we've ever seen. At least until you hit the final scene\\, and it's not the ending that bothered me exactly.\\n\\nI almost still gave this movie 5 stars because of how brilliant it was\\, and it is a great movie to see again. But I feel significantly less interested in episode 9 and I'll tell you why...\\n\\nWe all came for Luke Skywalker\\, and that's it plain and simple.  Everyone else is great and incredible actors\\, but let's not fool ourselves here. We came for the epic light saber battle with Luke. To me the force projection was an amazing Jedi trick and a good lead up to a 3rd film. Killing Luke was completely unnecessary. \\n\\nI can still watch this film a hundred times\\, I just have no desire to see a 9th one.\\n\\nAnyway\\, great work Rian Johnson you are a fantastic film maker.","true":true}
