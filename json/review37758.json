Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was so much that was bad in this movie.  The worst example\\, the Leia scene\\, was the director trying to be \\\"clever\\\" and it came off as incredibly stupid.  Most of the story was pointless and contrived\\,  I could care less about any of these characters anymore\\, I am done with SW.","true":true}
