Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It is riddled with plot holes\\, in a piece meal fashion\\, with complete disregard to every Star Wars movie that came before it. It was far too long of a movie to leave so many details out. The lack of character development\\, overuse of schoolyard humor\\, and blatant disrespect to the franchise cannot be overlooked.","true":true}
