Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes. Too many jokes trying to compete with marvel or other superhero movies in those terms. Luke's character was destroyed and Leia scene was one of the worst ideas in star wars. Obviously Disney doesn't care. Kids enjoyed it and that is all that matters for them because it represents revenue. What George Lucas created was destroyed. I think it competes with the phantom menace as the worst star wars movie.","true":true}
