Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly Paced\\, bloated\\, tedious\\, completely joyless and utterly unsatisfying.\\n \\nThis is a movie that is desperately seeking to subvert expectations to such a degree that it ultimately undermines its own narrative. From a story-telling point of view\\, it takes away every potential plot point and replaces it with.....nothing. The point seems to be \\\"do the opposite of what everyone wants or expects\\\" regardless of the logic or the outcome it has on the story and characters. As Luke says: \\\"this isn't going to go the way you think\\,\\\" except he doesn't mean that in a cool way where you learn Vader is his father; he means that in a horrible and boring way where nothing has any real meaning and the universe is just random and post-modern.\\n\\nThis movie essentially stops the sequel trilogy in its tracks by undoing everything setup in the Force Awakens.\\n\\nI am completely shocked and baffled that Disney would allow this film to be released in its current state. I am beyond astonished Bob Iger (CEO of Disney) has watched this movie multiple times and did not demand to at very least have the movie re-edited. It is insane to me that Kathleen Kennedy(president of Lucasfilm) watched the same movie I did\\, and came to the conclusion the person who wrote and directed this needs to get his own trilogy...It is just unbelievable.\\n \\nKids will be bored watching this\\, general audiences will leave the theater disappointed and confused\\, and fans of the franchise will detest this movie.\\n \\nSo you have to wonder who this film is for? \\n\\nDisney\\, Lucasfilm and Ryan Johnson have done the unthinkable. They have created a film that actively seeks to damage it's own brand and alienate the fans in irreversible ways.\\n\\nAs a film\\, it's overly long and dull\\, as a part of the star wars saga it's devastating to the brand.","true":true}
