Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll start off by saying I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. I've watched the films when I was young and watched the 7th one at the cinema. However\\,this film was great and I will definitely re-watch it. It's got exactly what you would expect from a Star Wars film;it's got plenty of action\\,twists and turns and a certain sci-fi element to it. However\\,this one improves on episode 7 in a lot of ways-one of the best examples is making me like Ben (a character who I didn't like) \\nAlthough a lot of things in the film felt forced (no pun intended) one huge one example that comes to mind is -SPOILER WARNING-killing off Luke in the cheapest way possible-like I said before\\,I'm not a huge Star Wars fan so it didn't impact me as much as others. Which is a shame because I was beginning to like the older Luke...\\nOverall it's a great film\\,but killing off Lule in such a cheap way just screams that it wants to reboot the series. As a grade I'd give it an A-","true":true}
