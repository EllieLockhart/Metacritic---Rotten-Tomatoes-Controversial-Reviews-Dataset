Gripped the whole way through and I think if it wasnt for Cyberpunk 2077 coming out this year it would be my GotY already.Wow.It's a must own\\, tackles a lot of heavy and dark psychological moments.Absolutely loved it.  Can't wait for part 3 one day.Seems another generation of games ends with a last of us.  perfect send off for the ps4.It also seems like loads of people are hating on the game.  If someone's review is 19th of June\\, then they obviously didn't play through the entire game or even close to it.I would like to state it does feel a bit weird at first to see Ellie so (understandably) angry and sad.. but the second half of the game tells a tale too.. one where you think about your actions in the first half with more weight.  It's a very unique story and brave.  I loved it.. but I think you need to be older than 18 to appreciate it.. which is probably where   of these reviewers are going wrong.Furthermore\\, LGBTQ is represented in this game\\, however it feels natural and not slapped in your face repeatedly.  No one should care that Ellie is gay (TLOU DLC showed this).  If you do its surely your own fragile masculinity causing the issue here.Personally I think anyone with a discriminatory review should be banned and deleted.Either way\\, this game is a must play for the ps4.Graphics 10Story 9Mechanics 10Sound 10Replayability 10 (new game plus is there and reason to do so)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
