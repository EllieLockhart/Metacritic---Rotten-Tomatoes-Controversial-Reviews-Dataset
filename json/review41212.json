Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has way too many forced Marvel movie style jokes in the wrong places that kill the drama. They even have Leia flying through space like Iron Man. Yes\\, I'm serious.\\n\\nFurthermore\\, this movie took a crap on the Star Wars mythology and beloved characters. Now I understand why Mark Hamill had been saying that he disagreed with every decision that Disney and the director of this movie made about his character. It also took a giant crap on all of the interesting and exciting things that The Force Awakens setup and left us without nothing to be excited for in the next one.\\n\\nJJ Abrams will have his work cut out for him trying to cleanup this mess in the next one. Help us\\, JJ Abrams\\, you are our only hope.","true":true}
