Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi was a MESS! What a absolute dumpster fire! The force is not with this movie. How did this happen? Who okayed this? This is not alright.Their treatment of Luke Skywalker is appalling. The director and the writers should all be ashamed!","true":true}
