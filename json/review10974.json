Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having been a Star Wars fan since I was 11\\, this was the second worst installment ever\\, (only the Holiday Special is worse).  Plot makes no sense\\, movie doesn't even follow the plot lines of TFA.  Wait for the video release and then cringe at how the political correct agenda ruins a brilliant franchise.   I would leave 0 stars if I could.","true":true}
