Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"PSA\\n\\nThis is a repost of a review I did a few weeks ago after seeing TLJ.  I'm reposting partly to add a few additional reflections on what this means for Star Wars movies going forward\\, and partly as a PSA to warn readers about the swarms of bots and trolls (on both sides) that are hammering the audience reviews.\\n\\nHere are some ways to spot suspicious reviews:\\n1.\t%20 in the name.\\n2.\tNo name\\, just a picture.\\n3.\tWhen you click on the picture or name to find out more about the reviewer\\, you get URL not found.\\n4.\tA negative comment with 4-5 stars.\\n5.\tA positive comment with fewer than three stars.\\n6.\tA negative comment that is overtly sexist or racist (to discredit all negative reviews).\\n7.\tAccount created Feb 2018 with a very short review.  This might be legit\\, but did you really wait until now just to post a one-line \\\"review\\\"?\\n\\nMY REVIEW\\n\\nLike many others\\, I created a Rotten Tomatoes account just to rate TLJ.  I'm not fussy when it comes to movies like this.  I liked John Carter\\, The Force Awakens\\, and Rogue One despite their flaws.  Rogue One grew on me as I watched it a couple of times on blu-ray.  The Force Awakens was derivative\\, but it was OK.  It set up Episode 8 pretty well.\\n\\nI start with five stars because it's Star Wars and I had no specific expectations other than wanting to see a good story.  Then I subtract stars for things that detracted from my viewing experience.  I'd issue a spoiler warning\\, but actually there is no way to spoil TLJ beyond what Disney already did.\\n\\n1. Subtract one star for what they did to Luke and Yoda.  It was so out of character from what we saw in the OT that it needed a lot more development to get from there to here.\\n\\n2. Subtract one star because Rey is a Mary Sue.  One week she knows nothing about the Force\\, the next week she's using the Force like a Jedi Master with essentially no training.  She knows how to do everything better than anyone else and she has no character weaknesses to overcome.\\n\\n3. Subtract one star for the weak plot and generally poor writing.  I could write a term paper here\\, but to keep it short I'll mention a few of my favorite plot holes.  If a lightspeed suicide attack is so potent\\, why didn't the Resistance do it earlier in the story when they had more ships?  Why not use an astromech droid to pilot the attack instead of a human?  Why did Luke leave a map if he didn't want to be found?\\n\\n4. Subtract one star for the blatant political messaging.  It was laughably over-the-top and therefore ineffective propaganda\\, but it was annoying.  The strong female hero theme was done better in Rogue One because it was simply built into a plot that made sense in the Star Wars context.  Admiral Purple Hair as an exemplar of female leadership skills was a joke.  Releasing a handful of race animals to stick it to the man was a joke.\\n\\nThe entire plot arc involving Luke was disrespectful to the previous Star Wars movies\\, to the fans\\, and to Mark Hamill himself.  Rian Johnson seemed to go out of his way to humiliate Luke.  It alienated many fans\\, myself included.  What purpose did that serve?  This is not an art film to be shown at the Sundance Festival.  It's supposed to be entertaining.  If I wanted to see a story about a grumpy and depressed old man who has abandoned his youthful faith and optimism\\, I wouldn't have gone to a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nBy the way\\, when did burning ancient sacred books of the Jedi become something that Yoda would laugh about?  In the Star Wars universe\\, they are priceless cultural and historical artifacts if nothing else.  Did Yoda's ghost join ISIS while we weren't paying attention?\\n\\nThe Last Jedi could have been the perfect movie to satisfy the original fans with a suitable ending to the Skywalker saga\\, while attracting new fans with a great story and compelling new characters.  Instead\\, this divisive mess of a movie left me uncaring about the remaining characters and uninterested in Episode 9.  We know Disney can make a decent Star Wars movie (The Force Awakens) and even a good one (Rogue One).  With a $200 million budget\\, you'd think they could have done better with The Last Jedi.\\n\\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy may be putting on a brave front\\, but it is evident that TLJ did not live up to its potential after TFA.  Yes\\, the raw numbers for ticket sales look impressive at first glance\\, but hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue were missed in China alone.  The negative downstream effect on sales will be felt.  The new toys are already in clearance.  Where is the buzz?  TLJ was the ultimate Star Wars buzz-kill.  Who is excited to get the DVD\/Blu-ray when it is released?  Who is excited for the Solo movie?  Who is excited for Episode 9?\\n\\nI was hopeful that TFA followed by the better Rogue One\\, with the immense financial power of Disney\\, signaled the beginning of a new era of quality Star Wars movies.  Sadly\\, I was mistaken.","true":true}
