Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only was TLJ the worst Star Wars move in the franchise\\, it was the worst Star Wars story in the entire franchise.\\n\\nEven worse\\, it retroactively ruined TFA by going back and undoing everything that movie setup.\\n\\nSo now\\, Disney has wasted two movies just as a way to \\\"reset\\\" the franchise while trying to appease the fanbase.\\n\\nClearly\\, they wanted to move on from the characters in the old series\\, which is fine\\, but just do it offscreen.","true":true}
