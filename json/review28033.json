Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\naction that contradict logically explanations and go against what Star Wars is about. \\nMore feminist agenda than actually progressing the story and the franchise. Sad to see Star Wars become a marvel\/transformer film.\\nUseless characters with no arc\/ character development.\\nRey is a Mary Sue\\, who achieves everything but showed nothing for it.\\nWomen are strong and men are cowardly and stupid; that was the main point of this movie.","true":true}
