Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a perfect film by any means\\, it's filled with lots of problems\\, pointless subplots\\, bizarre character choices\\, and forced humor. But with all that said\\, for a 152 minute film\\, I was thoroughly entertained\\, was this what I expected? No but I definitely admire the film for making bold choices and taking risks that went against the usual Star Wars formula. I can definitely understand the hate this film has gotten from fans\\, but the stuff that's good is unbelievably good.","true":true}
