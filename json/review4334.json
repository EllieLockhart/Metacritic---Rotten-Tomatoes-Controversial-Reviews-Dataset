Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't believe that people are reacting badly because they did things to characters that they didn't want. Who cares!? It's a story about a galactic space war between good and evil. It's written wonderfully well\\, even though there may be one too many jokes. But it hardly \\\"ruins\\\" the story. Not every question was answered but that's not the point of a good story. The cinematography was amazing. The FX were amazing. The acting was amazing. The screenplay was amazing. \\nPeople need to stop taking this shit so seriously\\, that's not your job. Just sit down and enjoy the story. Top three Star Wars films.","true":true}
