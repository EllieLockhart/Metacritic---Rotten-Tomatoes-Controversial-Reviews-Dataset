Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is by far the most controversial film of the Star Wars saga\\, and not without good reason. Rian Johnson takes the franchise to new heights\\, pushing the boundaries of what Star Wars represents. Granted\\, the risks Johnson takes aren't always successful\\, but when they work\\, they REALLY work. The Last Jedi is a great film with incredible visuals\\, an all-star cast\\, and a ton of good old-fashioned adventure. It's not a perfect film by any stretch\\, but overall it's an enjoyable film. 7\/10","true":true}
