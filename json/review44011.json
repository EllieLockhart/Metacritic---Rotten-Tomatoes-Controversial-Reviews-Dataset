Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ had tons of potential\\, and had an opportunity to move a character along. But decided to go Mary Poppins. Both unrealistic and unbelievable even for the Sci-Fi world. Unfortunately this happened way to early in the movie\\, ruining the rest of the movie for me. About 50% of the movie was GREAT and worthy of Star Wars the other\\, well..","true":true}
