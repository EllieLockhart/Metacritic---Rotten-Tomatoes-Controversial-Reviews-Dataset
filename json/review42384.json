Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was about a half-hour too long (and my 16YO son and I discussed exactly all the places it should have been cut)\\, but was generally entertaining for the non-hardcore SW fan. Even so\\, it felt bizarre and derivative. The mind-bridge between Kylo and Rey felt snatched out of Harry Potter\\, which might explain why I thought it should no longer work after the lounging\\, gold-robed Evil Guy (with his dancing\\, red-robed guards) fell prey to the end everyone saw coming. As for superpower Leia and Luke's convoluted reluctance\\, no idea what those were about. Nor why the Admiral had to go down with the ship when at first she was just standing their\\, watching the transports get blown up. Was there no way to remotely control the ship\\, so she could escape on a transport (and get blown up) too?\\n\\nOn the plus side\\, there were some beautiful locations and special effects and a few amusing moments. And I was very relieved that the Oliver-Twisty slave kids of Casinoworld didn't burst into song at the end. It came pretty close.","true":true}
