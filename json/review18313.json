Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this film was very good. I'm a die hard Star Wars fan and I am very satisfied with this film. I loved the twists and turns\\, the characters\\, action sequences\\, and the visuals. My only issue with the film is the Finn and Rose storyline. I loved Finn and Rose\\, but I did not like their mission at all. I actually really liked the humor in the film a lot. I know it has been pretty controversial\\, but I thought the humor worked. I do think this film is less cohesive than The Force Awakens and I do think The Force Awakens is a slightly better film\\, but this film has so many amazing moments that it is almost as good! I'm seeing the film again this Friday and I can't wait to see where it ranks with the other Star Wars films. 4\/5 stars.","true":true}
