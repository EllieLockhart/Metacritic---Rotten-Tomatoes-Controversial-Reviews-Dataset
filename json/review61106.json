Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have a reason to give it a 5-star review well\\, I know that some people are just here to defend de game or hate on it and I get it\\, Im just here to tell MY opinion on the game. I bought this game when it came out and played and after I finished the game I realised that yeah naughty dog did put us in tears but if you see they fitted everything perfectly to make us cry and feel what the characters in game felt\\, naughty dog put us in 2 shoes Ellie's and Abby's they made us look at the same challenge but from different points of view and if you see not every video game does that right? Naughty dog made us HATE Abby at first but at least have some little mercy after making us play as her. Not only Abby if not our favorite main character Ellie they tried to make her look like a bad guy as well\\, they made us look at 3 different perspectives of Ellie and Abby which are 1 persona\\, 2 persona\\, 3 persona. I really liked that they made me feel like I was in a video game as the characters and for me its a really great accomplishment in video game history.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
