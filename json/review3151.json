Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically\\, I loved the movie as the next in the series following Force Awakens and leading to whatever the future is... I\u2019m not sure I love the connection (or lack of) to the original 6 movies. I can\u2019t determine if they are wanting to get us off of the \u201cSkywalker Bloodline\u201d story (which the first 6 movies were all about)... or if they will surprise us in the next movie. They have certainly set this up to go in it\u2019s own new direction or surprise us with a past connection. I do think it was too much like Empire to be original and the gap explaining how the Empire regained power has never been explained. With Darth Vader and the Emperor dying in VI\\, how did they gain full galactic power again or so quickly? ","true":true}
