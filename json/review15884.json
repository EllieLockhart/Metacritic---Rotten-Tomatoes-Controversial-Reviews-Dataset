Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the rises of this new characters. It appears to be either a longer-term project than 3 movies. I hope so. I like that we see a little more what was in the books \/ comics than in the previous movies. It's not a perfect movie\\, but it's a really good one!","true":true}
