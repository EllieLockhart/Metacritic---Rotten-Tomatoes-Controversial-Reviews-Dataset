Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half a star is too generous... Interesting that almost a week after release\\, Disney claims the poor audience ratings on Rotten Tomatoes are due to trolling\/bombing... Well\\, that prompted me to add my tuppence worth: the film was dire. I hated the prequels\\, but I still always felt like the prequels had integrity; TLJ has neither integrity nor credibility. I've been a fan since '77\\, and when Disney took over the helm\\, I had an open mind - I truly enjoyed TFA\\, and Rogue One even more. But TLJ? There were some good performances from the cast\\, young and old\\, but the writing was dreadful\\, and so un-Star Wars. Some of the people who like the film dismiss those who hate it by saying that the latter aren't open to new directions and ideas. It isn't true - the 'haters' just aren't open to sh*t directions and directing\\, and sh*t ideas. Flying Leia\\, the boring subplot (Finn & Rosie) to a boring chase through space\\, misused Luke\\, Holdo's decision-making (or lack of)\\, \\\"Godspeed\\\"\\, the constant stream of cheesy jokes\\, the plot holes bigger than a galaxy far\\, far way... Is TLJ meant to be a spoof or parody of the franchise? Perhaps a more honest title would've been Spaceballs: The Last Jedi. When I saw it\\, on opening day at Odeon Leicester Sq in London\\, the audience sat silent; at the end\\, there was polite clapping only for the dedication to Carrie Fisher. Afterwards\\, I spoke to the people sat next to me\\, and to others on the way out; everyone of them was disappointed with the film\\, nobody smiled... Star Wars had been a huge part of me until now\\, so stand up and take a bow Johnson\\, Kennedy and Disney. Thanks to you\\, I'm over it!","true":true}
