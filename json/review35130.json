Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens resuscitated the franchise. Now\\, The Last Jedi reinvents it. Twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and it had one of the most resonant endings I've seen in a Star Wars movie so far.","true":true}
