Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very enjoyable. I saw the first Star Wars movie in 1972 when I was in 8th grade and the franchise has had a special place in my heart ever since. None of the subsequent 6 movies could ever compare. But this latest offering really is wonderful. It carries the original spirit of the first movie\\, but adds sophistication and depth to its characters.","true":true}
