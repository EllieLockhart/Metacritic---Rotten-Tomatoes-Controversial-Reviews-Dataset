Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all of the buildup heading into this movie\\, it was a huge letdown.  From no new scores\\, to lazy storytelling\\, no backstory on Snoke\\, weak handling of Luke Skywalker\\, Princess Leia Superman move (what in the hell was that?)\\, forced jokes....it was disappointing.  I was fine with the ending.  I hope JJ can save the Trilogy.  Ironically\\, his VII turns out to be a hell of a lot better than VIII now.","true":true}
