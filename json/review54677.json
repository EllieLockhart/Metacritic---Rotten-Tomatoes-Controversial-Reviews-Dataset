Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I read some of the user reviews before I saw the movie\\, and boy were they all right. The movie is just not good. From useless new characters\\, to plot points leading no where\\, to original characters not getting their due\\, to uneven action pacing\\, this movie is truly a hot mess. Clearly designed with young audiences in mind that do not know anything about the original saga\\, I can see why so many movie goers felt the need to express their anger and disappointment in the reviews here.
