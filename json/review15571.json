Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the force awakens and even rogue one\\, but this movie had me scratching my chin. The force awakens was an amazing movie that successfully revived the series (it didn't really need reviving but it brought it back into the public eye). It just seemed that the last jedi ignored a lot of the questions that the audience had in the force awakens\\, or set them aside as irrelevant. The movie was too influenced by Disney. Plain and simple. From the cheesy humor to the pointless side plots it just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie. To be frank\\, revenge of the sith was better in my opinion. See it and make your opinion. Don't listen to critics or users. Just wanted to put my own two cents in.","true":true}
