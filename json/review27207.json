Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of those frustrating movies that teeters on the edge of greatness\\, but never quite gets there. I enjoyed getting to know the characters and some of the smaller set pieces leading up to the finale. However\\, I was ultimately just okay with the end and the movie as a whole. I expected just a touch more than it was. That would have been enough to push this over the top for me. ","true":true}
