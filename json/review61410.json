This is not a continuation of the first story at all\\, but instead feels like a bad spin off set in the Last of Us universe. You spend barely any time with the characters from the first game (and EVERY trailer for the second) instead being forced to play as the antagonist in a veil attempt at empathy or sympathy or god knows what. However\\, not only is Abby unlikable after the first 90 seconds on screen\\, but the narrative only continues to pile on the unlikable traits the more you play. At one point I was just continually and consciously jumping from a cliff to death for the small slice of joy seeing Abby's skull hit the rocks below. The split narrative is redundant and just detracts from both stories resulting in the end product feeling like an amalgamation of two short\\, bad DLC spin offs\\, instead of the true sequel it's intended to be.\r\rGame-play wise\\, it's much of the same from the first game. Look around\\, scavenge\\, hide\\, shoot. I don't mind it tbh but it does get repetitive after 7\/8 hours. The boss fights were really underwhelming  not providing much difficulty nor variation other than taking more damage than normal. There were also a few forced moments that were dumb\\, for example: a certain group of WLF deserters that you are forced to kill\\, even when one gives up and begs for mercy as the game will not continue without pressing the prompt. The added mechanics of jumping and dodging are so refreshing (for this game\\, obviously not gaming in general). I was impressed with the character animations as well. The way they fidget and twitch was a particular highlight and really adds to the realism. The graphics are great too.\r\rThe story is just a mess. I mean where to start? As a linear game play narrative I'm genuinely surprised how it could feel so inconsistent. The cast make plain nonsensical decisions that not only go against their own established character but some even defy common sense. The big end story revelation is completely deaf to it's own plot as Ellie has just murdered her way through dozens if not hundreds of randoms\\, and some innocents\\, only to suddenly feel remorse for the one person in the entire game it would have actually made sense to kill. Not only for the character\\, but for the underling theme of the entire franchise - that actions have consequences... but not for Abby it seems.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
