Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part ll is an emotional rollercoaster for its fanbase. The realism gives this game a feel that no other game quite has\\, the combat system gives you a constant adrenaline rush. Graphics are good yet inconsistent to the point it becomes annoying. Storywise it forces you to adapt to change in an uncomfortable yet realistic way when you think about the game\u2019s setting and circumstances. Think of this game like a brand new car with a large dent on the driver\u2019s side\\, everything works perfectly the gameplay feels amazing but the story is something hard to ignore. Now im going to stop being politically correct for a moment and start dropping the truth. The reason why this game has so many negative reviews is because they let somebody push a feminist agenda on a perfectly good game. They killed Joel right off the bat\\, They turned Ellie into Sigmund Freud\u2019s wet dream\\, Ellie\u2019s stealing a chick of some asian cuckboy and then you get to play as this monstrous giant female as if the people who work at character development have been living with an inferiority complex the size of the statue of liberty their whole lives. Its like somebody at naughty dog lost a bet to a misandrist. I liked the guitar so im giving this game a 6 for attention to detail.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
