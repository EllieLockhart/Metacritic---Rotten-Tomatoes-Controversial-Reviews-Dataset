Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story is pretty much ruined. Everything that was built up over the past decades\\, pretty much evaporated\\, leaving nothing behind but emptiness. No payoff. Friendships and histories went poof. The movie makes you feel just like you've been binge watching the greatest series on TV in existance\\, only to arrive at a point where suddenly you find out the show was cancelled and the show kills off everyone in the last episode. And it's not a good episode. Everyone is acting strange\\, things happen for no reason\\, and you see the camera getting dropped to the floor\\, at the end\\, before the credits roll. I hate this movie.","true":true}
