Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. Ugh. Errr. This had pacing issues. The cinematography was second to none. The 'spoilers' were ok. I am not upset about them the way some people are. \\n\\nMany complain about it being too 'jokey'\\, I thought it was a huge downer! We needed more jokes!\\n\\nThe theme seems to be\\, as many reviewers stated\\, 'egalatarianism'- the problem is that they shovel that stuff down your throat more than they did midiachlorians in the prequels! Where is the hope in this movie!? It's not dark\\, it's just super depressing! Enlighten me! Don't bum me out!\\n\\nAs where in empire\\, I feel that at the end we licked our wounds and lessons were learned\\, this one feels like a funeral!\\n\\nI don't know. I think I need to buy some deathsticks and rethink my life. :-\/","true":true}
