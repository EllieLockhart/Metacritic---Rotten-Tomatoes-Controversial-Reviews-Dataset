Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie opens up so many doors for the Star Wars universe. It added much needed depth to Kylo Ren\\, as well as giving much better insight into Rey. I appreciate the time spent getting to know both of these characters better. It dawdled in a few places\\, and had a tendency to use uninspired logic to move the plot forward. (Running out of fuel? Really?) The new characters that were introduced were fairly interesting\\, if not often unnecessary. The twist at the end was fantastic\\, and this movie included one of the most iconic Star Wars scenes ever. With a few tweeks in the script\\, this could've been a solid 4\/4.5 star movie.","true":true}
