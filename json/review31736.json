Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So the movie wasn't too bad. That being stated\\, I don't appreciate how the main protagonist (Rey) has had no legitimate struggle in this movie and in TFA\\, the saga's previous installment. I wouldn't go as far as to call her a 'Mary Sue' character but considering how easily she has learned to pilot the Millenium Falcon\\, beat Kylo Ren without a single scratch on her\\, and manipulate the force to do things that it took Anakin and Luke significantly longer to do\\, I find it hard to like and identify with her as a character. Keep in mind that so far\\, this sequel trilogy\\, in terms of Star Wars chronology\\, has only taken place within a matter of DAYS..... Anakin watched his mother die in his arms\\, lost one of those arms\\, dealt with the fear of losing his wife and soon-to-be-born children to death\\, and was denied the rank of Jedi Master as part of his character development. Luke had to watch his adopted parents and his home burn\\, obi-wan vanish into thin air\\, lose a hand\\, and deal with the fact that his father\\, the one person he originally wanted to emulate as a jedi\\, turned into the cyborg Sith Lord who hunts Jedi\\, brings suffering to the galaxy\\, and became the very tyrant he sought to destroy. It took the Skywalkers YEARS to get to where they got to. Rey on the other hand is simply skating through this entire trilogy like it's nothing and that bothers me. She gets three little lessons (one of which happened to be conveniently off-screen) and she's good to go. Also\\, other things that bother me include no mentioning of the knights of ren\\, little mention of Snoke's background\\, the nature of the rift between the First Order and the resistance pre-TFA\\, the poor treatment of Luke as a character in terms of his legacy\\, Admiral Akbar's off-screen death when he should have been the one to make the sacrifice instead of Holdo\\, the Rey-Finn-Rose love triangle along with Finn's wasted potential\\, General Leia's miraculous unscathed return from the vacuum of space\\, and Captain Phasma's cringe-worthy return only to meet a meaningless end.....again........\\nUltimately\\, for the sake of the saga\\, I do no think that the next trilogy should be put into the hands of Rian Johnson.  From this movie\\, I can see that in the future\\, he is going to ignore the interest of the fanbase that got Star Wars to where it is\\, blatantly disregard previous material and do things 'his way' at the expense of viewer satisfaction and most importantly\\, a good story. I truly hope that the next trilogy is stripped from Rian Johnson's grasp\\, because if he continues like this\\, then the only place that me and many other fans will be watching the remainder of the saga\\, if we watch it at all\\, is...dare I mention it...putlocker.","true":true}
