Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created this account for the sole reason of delivering a warning to anyone that's a star wars fan in my demographic\\, i.e. not a 5 year old child or mentally handicapped.  They completely blew it. This movie was a mess and I should have walked out when Leia force flew herself out of space after surviving an unsurvivable explosion.  How could Disney release such a travesty of a film?  I would have rather watched two hours of Rey and Luke talking and walking around the island than this JarJar disaster.","true":true}
