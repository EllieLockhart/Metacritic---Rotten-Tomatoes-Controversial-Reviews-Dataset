Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The big F U from both TFA and TLJ is that the SW galaxy is so braindead as to allow a new Empire to arise apparently right under their collective noses.  How are we supposed to respect Han\\, Leia\\, Luke\\, General Akbar\\, etc.\\, when having risked their lives\\, been tortured\\, had family and friends killed (in Leia's case her whole freakin' homeworld blown up) by the Empire\\, yet they've done nothing to stop them from coming back in this new iteration.  It's like allowing Nazi Germany arise again while we totally forgot the Holocaust  and our family members who died fighting them. In TLJ's First Order it's Star Destroyers\\, Stormtrooper uniforms\\, absolutely nothing's changed from the Empire.  Are evil tyrannical dictatorial empires just a part of life\\, like roaches that you can knock back but just can't get rid of?  Where's the scene where the our old heroes look at each other and say \\\"How the Hell did we let this happen again?\\\"  There's no valid explanation\\, it's just pure\\, insulting stupidity on the part of the filmmakers and DIsney.  I've seen every SW movie at least 10 times without even trying\\, yet I saw TFA one time and that was plenty--can't they come up with some other story\\, some new threat or conflict?  TLJ just made it a thousand times worse with all the other problems that others have noted.  My family loves SW\\, and the only who liked it was my 11-year-old.  For the rest of us\\, we will try and forget what we saw\\, just pretend it doesn't exist.  Have no interest (how can anyone?) in whatever lame final stakes TLJ offers for the next movie.  Find it interesting that two things I've loved practically my whole life--the NFL and Star Wars--have both died for me in just the last couple months.  The magic is gone and won't be coming back\\, as if someone I loved has cheated on me.\\n\\n Oh yeah\\, people keep mentioning too many jokes\\, I don't remember many jokes at all.  Certainly no one laughed very much in the theatre.  It was the 10:30 Friday opening weekend show\\, shoulda been red hot\\, instead it was a strangely subdued\\, half-full crowd.  I cheered out loud when Star Wars letters and music came onscreen (despite my misgivings from TFA)--I was the only person and promptly shooshed.  No one clapped at the end\\, and the people who stayed for the credits seemed to be hoping for a Marvelesque clip scene.\\n\\nAgain\\, the whole thing seems like a weird FU to someone who only had positive hopes for what a Star Wars final trilogy could be.  The critics are scared of Disney or idiots if they think this is anything but a crass merchandising ploy.  The audience is right.","true":true}
