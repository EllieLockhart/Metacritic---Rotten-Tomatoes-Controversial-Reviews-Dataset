Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2 stars for the effort\\, and that is already being generous. They didn't continue to establish Rey's story. Destroyed an already established character. The movie disregards everything that was set up in TFA. So\\, expect plot holes\\, convenient answers\\, and complete disrespect to the Star Wars franchise. You can't do what Snyder did\\, and think you get a pass just because it's Star Wars. I'm ignoring any new additions to this franchise. Whoever is in charge\\, has proven that they can't do a proper movie\\, let alone a Star Wars movie. Luke deserves better.","true":true}
