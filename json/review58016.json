Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the film has its flaws\\, they're nothing close to the Neo-Nazi \\\"social justice warrior - Marie Sue\\\" garbage that broke through the Reddit Alt Right for 5 minutes last year. The reality\\, as reflected by the 91% Tomato score\\, \\\"A\\\" Cinemascore\\, and 89% Comscore (not to mention the dozens other surveys that aren't hacked by the alt-right) is that 'The Last Jedi' stands with the best Star Wars films. Right there with 'A New Hope\\\" and 'The Empire Strikes Back'. It takes real chances\\, expands the mythology\\, is thematically potent\\, and most importantly\\, gives Star Wars a much needed kick in the pants with bold\\, relevant storytelling while tossing outdated habits to the curb. Not since 'Empire' has a Star Wars film been so unpredictable\\, so fresh\\, so thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat. The good news is that the pro-Trump alt-righters who hate this film will likely leave Star Wars fandom altogether. And good riddance. They can live their \\\"Make Star Wars Great Again\\\" fantasy by staying home and binging on original trilogy Blu Rays where 99% of the humans in the Star Wars Galaxy were white males. For the rest of us (the 90% of the general and fan population who liked the film) we get a relevant new Star Wars that'll live well into the future. A new hope indeed.","true":true}
