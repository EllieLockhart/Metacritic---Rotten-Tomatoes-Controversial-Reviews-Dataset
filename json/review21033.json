{"101487":146815,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was preparing to see The Last Jedi\\, and I was extremely excited. An Arizona tea perched next to my seat\\, tucked into the cup-holder. A 12-inch sub folded into my lap\\, and there were cotton candy skittles (don't ask) nestled in my pants\\, the result of a smuggling operation into the theater. I was expecting a good movie--no\\, a great movie. As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, and one who grew up with the universe in nearly every format available\\, I hold an obligation to see every Star Wars film as soon as possible. The Force Awakens had been a pleasant surprise. While it had flaws--specifically borrowing and recycling Star Wars ideas--it was a good origins story to a new trilogy that opened up the doors to new possibilities\\, questions and an exciting universe. I was excited to see these addressed in a sequel. And Rogue One\\, after that\\, was even better. Usually I try to avoid reviews to dodge pre-conceived notions\\, but some trickling reviews had slipped by me and I heard it was great. Needless to say\\, as the typical Star Wars intro scrolled onto screen\\, I was\\, in fact\\, a little biased toward Disney and Director Rian Johnson.\\nBut then the movie started.\\nIt opened into a space fight scene\\, with the First Order bombarding the Resistance. All good\\, at first. But then I started to hear the First Order commanders talk. My first questions--did an eight-year-old write this script? The first doubts started to enter my mind.\\n The focus drifted toward some random character I had never heard of before\\, a Resistance fighter who sacrifices herself to blow up a ship and secure an escape. Dramatically it paused with a still shot\\, like something I would see in a really cliche action movie. This character died and Johnson was somehow expecting me to care. Who was she? Why is this so dramatic? How is this related to the Force Awakens or any other Star Wars movie?\\nUnfortunately\\, these questions plagued my mind for the entire movie. Not only did I relentlessly squirm in my seat\\, pull my hair out\\, continuously check my phone to see when in God's name would this movie end\\, but I felt like my soul--which had long been tethered to America's most beloved universe\\, Star Wars--had been completely and utterly destroyed\\, shell-shocked and pissed upon.\\nThe movie was full of cliches\\, awful writing\\, plot holes\\, boring and pointless filler plots and annoying\\, one-dimensional characters that were created for an \\\"emotional impact.\\\" I feel bad for saying this\\, but I had been questioning Johnson's sanity and mental state\\, and I felt like he was either an eight-year-old writing his first chicken scratch comic book story for his mother or a mentally deranged lunatic escaped from an asylum.\\nFirst off\\, he tarnished Star Wars. This movie had no relation whatsoever to TFA\\, and completely butchered everything we expect from a Star Wars movie. I've never seen this done before; the magic-- the compelling force that makes Star Wars so creative\\, intoxicating\\, bold and innovative-- was taken out of Star Wars. You can say what you want about previous films such as TFA and the prequels\\, but at least they were Star Wars films. Gone are the structured universes\\, compelling quests and interesting characters and evolution that we see take place within every Star Wars. Instead\\, these elements are replaced with whiny characters\\, over-dramatic plot lines\\, a complete butchery of Star Wars legends and the most awful writing I have ever seen.\\nFor starters\\, the plot is focused on a two hour space chase that leads nowhere. All this does is give Johnson leeway to create over-dramatic\\, whiny characters that complain half the time. We have waited over thirty years to see Luke as a Jedi Knight and master\\, and instead we get a character that whines and sits on his ass the entire film. Leia does nothing but magically survive in space and use bullshit hidden powers\\, then retreat for the entire film. Rea is reduced to a boring character that does nothing but complain the entire film. Finn meets Rose\\, the worst Star Wars character ever (yes\\, even worse than Jar Jar Binks). Poe is reduced to squabbling and bitching to his superiors instead of actually doing anything\\, and he is buried once again. Johnson creates characters just to kill them so we can \\\"feel\\\" it. But in reality they feel recycled (one character is a stuttering idiot ripping off Han Solo) or so completely boring and useless you realize Johnson is just trying to sell merchandise. There is nothing revealed that we haven't seen before\\, Rea has no real training but she evidently is going into the last film an accomplished Jedi\\, and Kylo Ren is a whiny\\, emo brat who Johnson tries to \\\"switch up\\\" to trick us\\, but it really makes it uninteresting and petty. Snoke is ruined and unexplained and the ending reveals nothing\\, no continuation\\, nothing except \\\"yeah\\, this just happened\\, the most boring space chase and two and a half hours of your life.\\\"\\nIt's awful as a Star Wars film but even worse as a movie. The dialogue is so cheap and littered with cliches. Luke uses the word \\\"unfindable\\\" and the Resistance utters this cliche phrase over and over: \\\"We will be the spark that lights the flame.\\\" Please\\, am I reading the first draft of a high-schooler's action novel?\\nPlot holes are littered throughout--Rea and Kylo fight at one point with no conclusion then magically appear elsewhere doing unrelated things. Johnson tried so hard to be different that he made Star Wars a complete and utter tragedy.\\nThe polarization is clear. Critics love it\\, fans hate it. As of right now\\, Rotten Tomatoes critic score: 88 percent. Audience: 53 percent. You will never find another Star Wars film this polarized\\, and I think that says enough about the situation.\\nWhen I walked out of the movie theater\\, I felt sick. My legs wobbled unsteadily\\, my throat felt clogged\\, my teeth rattled incessantly. I felt depressed\\, disgraced\\, like someone had pissed on my mother's corpse. I felt completely and utterly wronged\\, exposed like someone had yanked the clothes off my body in public.\\nI felt broken\\, too. I felt like Star Wars would never be the same. I did\\, and still do\\, think Disney cannot recover from this tragedy.\\nRian Johnson\\, you may have blown America's most beloved franchise into smithereens\\, but Star Wars will recover\\, even if Disney will not.\\nI don't know about the rest of you\\, but I will never see another Star Wars film again in theaters. Disney will not have my money.\\nI will refer to the books\\, to the Thrawn trilogy\\, which I claim (as well as many real fans) as the real sequel to the Original Trilogy.","true":true}
