Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excess plot lines and no learning or growth from the characters introduced in the previous film created a convoluted mess that feels way too Disney will trying to hard to also be Star Wars and thereby being neither.","true":true}
