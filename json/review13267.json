Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why so many are down voting it. Yes\\, there are a few tonal missteps\\, but over all it's a brilliant\\, fresh new direction for the franchise. I for one will be seeing it several times to take it all in.","true":true}
