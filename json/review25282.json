Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No  continuity with TFA... pretty much every set up fell flat on its face. Then if you judge it as a stand alone film it gets worse. Horribly obvious \\\"plot twists\\\" and complete plot lines that have no bearing on the course of the story and add no character depth. This was a glaringly offensive ploy to push personal beliefs onto an unexpecting audience. Complete and utter failure.","true":true}
