Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While many people are hammering it right now I believe they just need to understand the plot better or stop crying about how it didn't go where they wanted. It was a good balance between the old (there are so many references to ESB - Luke & Yoda are so similar) and the new\\, leaving the new characters to head off on their own. Not the best Star Wars ever and I left feeling a bit 'what the' but with time and thinking about it\\, I got it !","true":true}
