Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Corporate moviemaking. No soul. The special effects are dazzling but quickly become boring. The script is moronic. Rey learns how to become a Jedi in ten minutes.  Lame humor that at times made the movie seem like a Mel Brooks parody. Tedious\\, badly written dialogue scenes that felt interminable. Deux ex machine solutions to plot jams. The Luke Skywalker double at the end is a cop out a d made me furious. Hated this movie\\, but loved The Empire Strikes Back. Back when movies had a soul.","true":true}
