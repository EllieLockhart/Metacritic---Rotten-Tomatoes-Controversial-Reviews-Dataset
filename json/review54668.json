Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I only gave TLJ one star so my rating gets included.\\nIt really deserves zero stars.. \\n\\nFirst let me say I still love Mark Hamill. He did his best.\\nAnd Mark if you ever read my review please know that we all still love you. We know that you had your hands tied on this one.\\n\\nI actually hate this movie. I never thought I would hate Star Wars\\, but I do. \\nI HATE STAR WARS!! \\n\\nIf you grew up loving Star Wars this movie will destroy that love.\\nAnd it's ironic because Mr. Walt Disney created that magic and George Lucas had it too in the original trilogy. That magic was in the original Disney cartoons and movies.\\n\\nThe new Disney only cares about money and pushing a political message and not at all about making a good movie. \\n\\nIronically the new Disney is The Empire..   \\n\\nKathleen K. and her terrible writing staff and the director should be completely banned from any future Star Wars movies.\\n\\nBut to be honest even if they were\\, it's too late. Myself and millions of fans will never spend another dime on future Disney Star Wars movies or merchandise.  \\n\\nAnd I feel bad for Ron Howard who is directing the new 'Solo' movie because it is going to bomb because despite what new Disney thinks most of us are completely turned off and will not be watching anymore of the new Disney Star Wars movies.","true":true}
