Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ignored both episode 7 and the original trilogy just ti be different and \u201csubvert expectations\u201d. Not a great strategy for a sequel. The plot went nowhere\\, the forced humor fell flat. Probably the worst Star Wars I\u2019ve ever seen. ","true":true}
