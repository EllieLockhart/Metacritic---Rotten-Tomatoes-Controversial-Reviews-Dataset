The story was absolutely paper thin and was not told well at all. The new characters were not well developed and frankly I felt apathetic throughout. The Ellie and Dina storyline had potential to be memorable but they decided to make you play the game as another character and failed to accomplish anything any reasonable person didn't already understand about Abby.The gameplay is painfully and frustratingly repetitive and meaningless. This game did not need to be as long as it is.The game looked and sounded great. But it meant nothing because it was a waste of time playing. Like having a beautiful high performance car that doesn't run. I could go on to rip this game apart a lot more but I don't want to waste any more time with this game. The saving grace is that I bought a physical copy so I will be returning it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
