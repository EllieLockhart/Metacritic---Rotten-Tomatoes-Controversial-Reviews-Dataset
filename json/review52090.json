Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing The Force Awakens\\, I don't know if I had even been more excited for a sequel in any franchise. All the mystery and new characters from Force Awaken's were then promptly mishandled in this new installment\\, The Last Jedi. Even old beloved characters of whom were \\\"legends\\\" were chewed up and spit out by the script. Finn and Rose have surely replaced Jar Jar as the worst character(s) in the entire franchise as well. Leaving The Last Jedi I feel as if the Star Wars franchise is now irredeemable and I am in no way looking forward to anything in the next installment of the trilogy and possibly even spin-offs. Disney\\, please retcon this.","true":true}
