{"101487":169370,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead.  I walked out of the theater stunned.  The Force Awakens left me with a sinking\\, empty feeling\\, but I still enjoyed it.  This feeling was much worse.  I grew up loving the original trilogy\\, but TFA turned me into a giddy little theorizing fanboy.  The Last Jedi has stopped that in its tracks.  I did not enjoy this movie overall\\, and have really nothing to look forward to in the next one\\, either quality-wise or plot-wise.  I can't believe I'm glad that JJ Abrams is coming back.\\n\\nThe fundamental problem with this movie for me is that it was not immersive and\\, on the whole\\, not very engaging to me.  One way or another\\, it repeatedly took me out of the movie and reminded me that I'm sitting in a theater watching a Star Wars film.  I did not feel like I was in a galaxy far far away.  I re-watched the original trilogy and TFA just before seeing this one\\, and the difference is stark.  It's in the immersion into a fantastic world that I think the \\\"magic\\\" of Star Wars mainly lies.\\n\\nI have no real problem with any of the film's big surprises.  I mostly enjoyed the cheeky humor.  I didn't even mind much how Luke was handled -- though his climactic act was terribly disappointing.  (I wanted Luke to actually be there and take on that whole First Order unit by himself -- and then probably die from the exertion of using the force.  It would be legendary.  Instead we get holo-Luke\\, which is cool\\, but soooo disappointing compared to what I was led to believe for a minute.)\\n\\nAnyway\\, I thought this film had some great ideas and some great moments.  But the overall execution?  I was bored for at least half of the movie.  Not bored because it was slow in places.  I love slow\\, dramatic movies and non-stop action movies alike.  But I was not engaged.  Where was the tension?  Only in a few places.\\n\\nAnything that was not the Rey \/ Luke \/ Kylo story felt like a mediocre spaceship TV show episode that I would not bother to watch\\, let alone pay for.  The mutiny idea was cool\\, but what a trite and shallow execution.  This is a character centered movie that mostly fails to linger well in the right moments and to deepen its characters.  I liked all the characters better in TFA.  Here they mostly run around saying things\\, and I don't really care what they're saying.  I did like Kylo's development\\, and the development between Rey and Kylo.  But as for Rey\\, come on\\, we're two thirds of the way through this story and I still don't really understand who Rey is.  TLJ didn't really deepen her character at all for me.  It's like TFA assumed the characters would be better fleshed out in TLJ\\, and TLJ assumes the characters were fleshed out enough in TFA.  This movie does a great disservice to our new characters.\\n\\nThe Rey \/ Luke \/ Kylo plot was crowded by the bloated\\, rubbish space chase plot\\, and so my favorite thread of the movie was awkward\\, forced and rushed.  It didn't carry all the emotional impact that it should have.  Cut out the ridiculous casino planet \\\"just keep the characters busy\\\" plot (what a waste of Finn) and give us a little more time with Rey's.  Have Finn and Poe get to know each other better.  I'd be happy if Rose was still there.  Have the Resistance touch down on the final planet with many more troops\\, preparing for a final fight\\, or have them regroup with another half that's waiting for them there.  And have them stand their ground in an epic battle and get decimated.  Then have Luke show up and do his thing and die heroically.  Or... have a better spaceship showdown.  It's not hard to make this movie better for EVERYONE.  Oh well.\\n\\nIf this movie made the emotional connection it certainly wanted us to have\\, and if it cut the pointless filler and immersed us better in the lives and worlds of these characters\\, I would probably call this the greatest Star Wars movie ever.\\n\\nHere's a few of my questions... Why wasn't hyperdrive ramming used on the Death Stars?  Why wasn't it at least used earlier in the movie by the ships that knew they were toast?  And why didn't Holdo turn around to ram Snoke's ship as soon as the escape shuttles departed?  Why did she not act until they were getting blown up?  Wasn't she already planning to die?  Why didn't Phasma just killed the hacker guy\\, instead of sending him off with a ton of money and a ship?  She already had the info she needed\\, and this guy proved he's a danger to the First Order\\, knows way too much about their ship security\\, and demonstrated he'd help the Resistance for the right price!  Why did holo-Luke not tell Leia that he was going to stall so they could escape through a passage in the back?  Why did he leave it to someone (Poe) to surmise this?  This is just silly writing.\\n\\nI think I'll probably wait until the first of Rian Johnson's new trilogy is on Netflix before I see it.  I really believed in this guy.","true":true}
