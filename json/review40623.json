Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie to date. This thing is absolutely shit I can't believe someone approved this garbage to be released in the first place. Btw it's been 6 months since it came out\\, and I'm still battling with the trauma this movie gave me!","true":true}
