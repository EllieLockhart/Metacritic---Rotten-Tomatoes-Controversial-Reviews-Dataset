Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely love Star Wars\\, but this was garbage. What Rian Johnson did to Luke Skywalker's character was an absolute travesty. Not to mention ridiculous plot-holes\\, ludicrous side-stories\\, characters who are there just to sell toys to little girls (get ready for \\\"Disney's - The Adventures of Paige and Rose\\\") and humour that is completely forced.\\n\\nThis film feels like the contrivance of a bunch of executives each trying to seize more markets demographics. It's a disjointed\\, awful mess of a film. \\n\\nWhen you're working with a setting as wonderfully deep and interesting as the Star Wars universe\\, there is no excuse to turn out such absolutely unauthentic\\, bland garbage as this film.","true":true}
