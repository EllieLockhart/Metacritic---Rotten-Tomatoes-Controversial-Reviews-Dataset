Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many contrivances that are blatantly contrary to the Star Wars universe but forced into being for \u201cplot\u201d purposes. Way too many attempts at Jar-Jar Binks style comedy scattered throughout. Left me with the impression that Riann Johnson was more focussed on flipping the bird at JJ Abrams\u2019 TFA than he was with putting together a quality film deserving of the Star Wars title.","true":true}
