Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has easily become the worst movie in the Star Wars Saga. Taking the viewer through a boring and nonsensical subplot and going against past movies in terms of how the force and hyperspace works. And then proceeded to rehash a multitude amount of scenes from Episodes 4-6. The Last Jedi should be fully removed from the Star Wars canon and looked upon as an utter and complete failure.","true":true}
