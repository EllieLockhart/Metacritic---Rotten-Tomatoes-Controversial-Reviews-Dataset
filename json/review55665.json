Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my\\, where to start???  I guess I'll start with this...I wanted to leave this the minimum rating of 1\/2 star\\, but according to other commenters RT is negating anything under a full star\\, so here ya go.\\n\\nI cannot for the life of me figure out who this movie is trying to appeal to.  Diehard fans like myself and my family hated it.  My kids were bored and not entertained by the Porgs...if that is what Disney and their merchandising machine were hoping for they failed.\\n\\nI figured they were hoping to entice the Asian markets by featuring an Asian actress.  But looks like even the Chinese rejected this\\, so the tedious minutes the awful Rose was on screen was wasted.\\n\\nI guess that leaves millenials who are entertained by flashy scenes and cannot follow a decent plot.  So there it is.  A new breed of Star Wars.\\n\\nThis movie was dreadful.  It had no cohesive storyline and was so full of holes an AT-AT could fall through.  The characters from The Force Awakens remain underdeveloped.  New characters clutter an already bloated movie and they were awful (see Rose).  \\n\\nI feel sorry that this was Luke and Leia's sendoff\\, they deserved better and so do the fans.  It's as if Disney was convinced they could pass any crap off as long as it has the Star Wars logo and it will be loved.  Sorry Disney\\, you can polish a turd but it still stinks.  Just like this movie.","true":true}
