Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To all those who're saying it's bad you forget that the story is continued in books\\, comics and video games. The Battlefront 2 last jedi dlc expanded on the movie showing that the first order had all those reserves already to go. They've had YEARS! to prepare for this. I'm sure the new coming books will expand on snoke as well. Loved it all and will watch it again. I love the original trilogy and yes even the prequel but it seems you can't satisfy the OT fans unless they bring in legends stuff...even then they'll hate it.","true":true}
