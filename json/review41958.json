Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie killed Star Wars as a franchise\\, not necessarily because of characters that lived\/or died\\, but how it did it in a way that undermined the lore and the entire franchise. Nonsensical developments weren't set up (like Leia flying)\\, and the diversity felt forced at the expense of the universe.\\n\\nMoreover the tone was off\\, and fetid attempts at humor just weren't funny. At least with the mediocre prequels I still loved the originals--this undermined the originals.\\n\\nLastly it doesn't end so much as a cliffhanger as an end to the franchise. With Rey established as the most powerful force user\\, what's the point of watching? Where's the character arc?","true":true}
