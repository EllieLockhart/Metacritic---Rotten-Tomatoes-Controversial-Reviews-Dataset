Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the hardest movie to review I have ever seen. I am a pretty big Star Wars fan\\, I watched all 9 movies\\, got the despecialized editions online and yeah New Hope and Empire are 2 of some of the greatest works of art in history. So naturally\\, I was really hyped to see this movie because  it looked like it was going to counter a big problem with TFA which was such a blatant similarity to New Hope like some parts scene by scene. Which that movie was good\\, not great but good and was just what the franchise needed\\, a fresh\\, fun\\, break away from the dreaded prequels. Now I saw this movie twice so I have had a lot of time to think about it. Let me say that some people are wrong in saying that THIS IS NOT A BAD MOVIE. I was shocked at how low the audience score was and that's why i signed onto this site. Now its not as good as the tomatometer says either\\, which is sad but let me explain. I will try to keep away from spoilers but just listen. This movie has to potential to be amazing\\, but youd need to shave 45 minutes off\\, because one of it's problems is that it's too long for its own good so they cram in plot points to make it longer especially finn and rose which was idiotic. So other than that it's just the execution thats off here\\, there is some really good content in this movie. I love the duality of luke skywalker\\, the idea of brawls amongst the Resistance\\, and Rey finding her parents\\,and Chewbacca should have eaten that porg........i know its stupid but he pulls peoples limbs out and is to chicken TO EAT A CHICKEN\\, it looks friggin delicious. Any way\\, my tomato meter is at 80%\\, it had potential but just missed the landing in Star wars terms\\, But the one last thing that is a flaw is that I am not gonna be as excited for IX\\, i won't spoil it but\\, theres nothing left to be excited about except these characters in the new trilogy. The only ones i like are Poe\\, Rey\\, and Kylo\\, thats about it. I don't like Finn as much as TFA\\, I hate Rose's character\\, and everyone else i just don't care......but under it all its a great movie....just executed wrongly. So the audience score is lower than I. I say thats wrong but so are the critics. Thank you for listening and may the force be with you.","true":true}
