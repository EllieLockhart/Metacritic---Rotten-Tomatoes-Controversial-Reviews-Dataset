Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really didn't enjoy this movie. Don't get me wrong there was some cool things in it such as Yoda and the fight scene with the guards\\, but the story was a very very slow police chase. Most of my thoughts have already been said under reviews on you tube by others. Ie the light saber scene. Why throw when he could just drop. The pointless Finn storylines when he could have been utilised a lot better as he is a talented actor say going to get fuel? Snoke\\,s death I mean come on I am just praying JJ can bring this story back and just hope Disney think twice about the director of the next trilogy. Please think twice.","true":true}
