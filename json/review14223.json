Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it a 2.5\\, mainly because only half the movie is worth watching.  The parts with Rey\/Luke\/Ben are okay and do their job at moving the overall story along.  I do disagree with the treatment and overall attitude of Luke\\, but it can be rationalized and the end of his story could've been far more fulfilling than what happened.  The completely deflating and anti-climactic revelation\/deferral of Rey's parents was a disappointment\\, and it could've gone into more detail of explaining aspects from Force Awakens that were completely ignored by this film.\\n\\nThe half of the movie concerning the Resistance and First Order are forced\\, boring and pointless.  You have new characters introduced that serve no purpose past making odd descions that force the story go down a path that is an illogical\\, needless waste.  The entire excursion to find a slicer could've been removed with zero plot loss and would've left extra time for more important matters.\\n\\nIn the end\\, it's a sequel that has a hard time finding it's place in the overall bigger picture.  It ignores much of what it's supposed to be a sequel to and goes off in it's own odd direction for the betterment of none of the movies that came before it.","true":true}
