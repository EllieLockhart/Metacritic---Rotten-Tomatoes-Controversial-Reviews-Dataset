Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Waste your time with a 45minute side plot that goes nowhere. Ruins a fantastic story arc for Fin to sacrifice himself. For a none existant love story\\, ruins the character of Lyke Skywalker. I wont ever see a R.Johns film again.","true":true}
