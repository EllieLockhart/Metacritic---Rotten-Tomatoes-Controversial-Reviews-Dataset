Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie.  Slapstick comedy feels \\\"forced\\\"\\, Leia can fly in space now?  and the First Order's plan is to wait for warp capable ships to run out of gas?  So pissed off by this recent entry - it's horrible!","true":true}
