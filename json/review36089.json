Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a boring mess in every way that modern blockbusters usually are; disposed of every interesting plot The Force Awakens left to be resolved; and squandered what little remained of the original magic. I will not bother to see the third film.","true":true}
