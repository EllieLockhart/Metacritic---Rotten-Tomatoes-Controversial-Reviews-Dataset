Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much Star Wars canon that has been trampled all over.\\n\\nHumor is far too forced and doesn't belong\\, feels like a Marvel movie.\\n\\nPrincess Leia flying like superman after been blown up\\, dodging shrapnel\\, going through decompression\\, then tumbling through the vacuum of space was HILARIOUSLY bad.\\n\\nThen there's how the entire premise of the movie\\, the Resistance outrunning an Imperial fleet\\, could have been instantly ended if the Empire just warped in some star destroyers or fighters to cut off the THREE remaining underpowered Rebel ships.\\n\\nSO MANY PLOT HOLES AND IDIOTIC CHOICES.\\n\\nAs a hardcore Star Wars fan... man\\, this hurts.","true":true}
