Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars films always have some humor. But there is a difference in the kind of humor between \\\"aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper\\\" and Jar Jar having a laser stuck to his foot\\, kicking randomly and taking out droids. The Last Jedi had too much of this Jar Jar like ridiculous humor. It conflicted with the tone of so much of the rest of the movie. And\\, come one\\, if Luke has become a jaded old man\\, give us more as to how this happened. There was some great stuff - Mark Hamill's and Adam Driver's acting and the saber scene with Ren and Rey come to mind. But there was so much bad... ugh.","true":true}
