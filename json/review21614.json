Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson pissed all over the legacy of star wars\\, this was so bad i wanted to walk out several times. I have no interest in episode 9 now. How do you take a character like luke and completely destroy who he was. Leai in space was the worst moment in the movie. Disney has killed any hopes of salvaging star wars\\, should ha e left it to Lucas. Star wars is not a comedy either\\, too much stupid slapstick in all the wrong moments. Man i have never hated a sw film like this and have no desire for repeat viewings.","true":true}
