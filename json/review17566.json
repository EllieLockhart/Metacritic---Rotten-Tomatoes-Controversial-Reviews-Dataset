Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it just me\\, or does it feel like SJW's have killed Star Wars? An utterly crap movie. While I enjoyed the token Star Wars bits\\, it was mostly lightly disguised bullshit post modern garbage.  No wonder why Mark Hamill hated it.  True Star Wars fans must be seething. Worst thing since Jar Jar binks.","true":true}
