Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"! Spoilers ahead !\\n\\nIt's a well made film\\, it went into directions I never excpetd it to gIt's a well made film\\, it went into directions I never excpetd it to go\\, and that's a good and also a bad thing. In my mind I envisioned a completely different movie\\, with Luke getting past his grief and mistakes and owing up to them\\, with Snoke turning Ben Solo into a complete monster\\, or at least severely punishing him for the mistakes he made that caused Starkiller base to be lost. Instead I found myself watching a movie that... wasn't as enjoyable. Snokes motivations\\, who he is\\, where he's from\\, how he got his power is never explained. Instead he's killed off like it was nothing after showing so much potential for him to just fuck shit up. The whole Salt planet scene for me was just bad\\, it was not what I wanted. Luke sacrificed himself to save the alliance and for a new rebellion to be born\\, but for what? The movie spends a chunk of time trying to convicne us to \\\"Let the past die\\, jedi need to die off\\\" etc. They put Luke on this \\\"I don't care about anything or anyone anymore\\\" path yet they didn't commit to it and felt like they jumped ship because the plot demanded it. The structure of the film just upsets me the more I think about it. Phasma is fucking useless yet again\\, she could've been another \\\"TRAITOR\\\" trooper for all I care\\, she had so much potential to be someone special but alas\\, she was wasted. Fin's side story felt misplaced\\, it had great and important moments but ultimately...it was for nothing and took away from important screen time that could've been used on Snoke\\, Phasma\\, Luke...anything but that sequence.
