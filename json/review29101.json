Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really quite bad. Didn't feel like an authentic Star Wars movie at all.\\n\\n- The humor was totally out of place. Clearly Disney is trying to homogenize Star Wars to be like their other series\\, and are in the process destroying it. The attempts to be funny are not particularly funny\\, but completely detract from the gravity of the situation - breaks immersion.\\n\\n- The dialogue was terrible (at times). I don't want to spoil it\\, but there were a number of times I literally rolled my eyes at the cliche crap.\\n\\n- Idiotic characters\\, who were stupid just for the purpose of giving other characters something to do and\/or padding the runtime.\\n\\nThere is more - but lots cannot be discussed without spoiling it.\\n\\nThis is a really bad movie.","true":true}
