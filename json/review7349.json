Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VIII was a good film. Other adjectives that come to mind: solid\\, enjoyable\\, fun and beautiful. But my biggest complaint with it was A) its handling of Luke and B) the story. By the end of the story\\, I don't feel as if I am any closer to any kind of resolution for this new era of the Star Wars saga. Yes\\, some amazing things happened and yes\\, we got some answers\\, but the choices made in the film are lukewarm. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a fun ride and definitely will see it again. But as a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I was disappointed in how they handled its most iconic character and set up and future films.","true":true}
