I hope they don't make these mistakes in the future.\r\rGolden seals for the acting and the visuals of the game. Ashley Johnson as Ellie being the main focus performed flawlessly and deserves the praise.

Which really hurt any connection one might develop to them and certain character deaths remain without impact.\r\rDespite Laura Bailey's incredible work with Abby\\, the character was simply set up to be despised from the start. And all the attempts to make her understood failed miserable. I again refer to the poor narrative structure that caused this.\r\rI congratulate the economical success this game is.
