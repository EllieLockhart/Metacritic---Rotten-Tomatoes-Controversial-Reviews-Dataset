{"101487":136766,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-12","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not part of a Russian botnet\\, I am not an alt right troll\\, and I'm not part of some toxic conspiracy.  I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and I absolutely loathe this film.  It makes a mockery of the story and canon from the first seven films of the canon.  Every plot strand from The Force Awakens is either 1.)ignored entirely\\, or 2.)given a purposefully anti-climactic ... almost mocking ... resolution.  \\n\\nThis film is just an absolute mess of plot holes\\, broken or unfulfilled narrative strands\\, and I don't like how it seems to purposefully ignore what Star Wars fans probably want to see.  It drops traditions like bad habits and scolds us that we shouldn't want them in the first place.  There is no lightsaber v. lightsaber battle in a numbered Star Wars film. Rey is just an idealized caricature at this point\\, and I can't identify or enjoy her story because she never struggles and is inexplicably wonderful and perfect at everything she does.  If I was Mark Hamill I'd be devastated at what they'd done to Luke Skywalker.  Luke is going to murder a sleeping child\\, the son of his sister and his best friend\\, a child sent to him for instruction and entrusted to his care\\, because the child is thinking bad thoughts?  Are you serious?  That's really a crucial plot point?  Did none of the people working on this story or script ever actually watch a Star Wars movie?  The resolution of this film is as stupid and anti-climactic as anything I've ever witnessed. \\n\\nI have no idea where they go from here.  There is nothing left except scorched earth\\, ruined plot possibilities\\, and an utter disdain for the Star Wars I-VII.  \\n\\nOh\\, and one more thing: I do not need a morality\/political lesson in my Star Wars films.  Least of all\\, an anti-capitalistic message from Disney\\, of all companies.  They found time for animal rights and war profiteering political messages in this film\\, but somehow I don't think Disney is going to talk about the evils of exploiting third world labor to make toys for rich westerners\\, bribing legislators to rob our public domain blind\\, or outsourcing tech jobs to foreign countries or abusing the H1B visa system.","true":true}
