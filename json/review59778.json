In fact\\, that can be fun and interesting and thought provoking. The the characters and backstory are so unlikeable that you can't empathize with their reasoning. The result of that is just feeling (as the player) frustrated and betrayed. I didn't enjoy the gameplay and I didn't enjoy the story and I didn't empathize or feel connected to any of the characters or their motivations. It's a bad game. Druckman made it impossible to empathize and care about new characters whilst assassinating old\\, well-loved ones.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
