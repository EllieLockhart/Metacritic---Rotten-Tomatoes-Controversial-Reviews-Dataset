I couldn't stop playing it until I beat it\\, it was so fun...beat it in 2 sittings...I think it could actually be the scariest and most fun horror game I have played and I've played a lot of horror videogames. From start to finish\\, the game has you hooked! Only negative that bugged me was...the walking was kinda slow and annoying to control sometimes..but the game was super successful as a horror game\\, so that negative can be overlooked looking at the overall package.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
