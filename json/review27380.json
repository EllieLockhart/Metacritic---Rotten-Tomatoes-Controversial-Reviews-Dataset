Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Otimo filme cheio de cenas arrepiantes e nostalgicas esses \\\"f\u00e3s\\\" que n\u00e3o gostaram e querem tirar ele da linha original da historia n\u00e3o s\u00e3o e nunca ser\u00e3o f\u00e3s de verdade de star wars !!!! otimo filme very very good","true":false}
