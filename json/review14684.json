Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been so disappointed or bored in a movie before. I seriouslydon'tknowjow anyone could have enjoyed this utter garbage. The worst part is that it could have been good. It was so poorly executed\\, the characters had no chemistry\\, acting from some of the stars was B-movie level at best and the \\\"funny\\\" bits didn't do much for the story.\\n\\nThe ticket sales for this movie have dropped off by 77% after a week in cinemas. That is all you have to look at to get an idea of how bad this film is.","true":true}
