Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a Disney by-the-numbers type of film. Notice that all the hero's are minority or women actors and all the bad guys are white men or white women? There some subtle brainwashing going on right there.\\n\\nLooks like Disney is in the process of making the most politically correct star wars from here on out so that means if you are a white male\\, you will automatically be cast as the bad guy because\\, you know\\, white males are bad. As for the hold-outs like Luke and Han\\, notice how they just killed them off? G-d forbid we have a white male hero in these films.","true":true}
