Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"UPDATE: After speaking with a fellow Star Wars aficionado I'm kicking my rating up to 3 stars and will go see the movie again. But if it still sucks its going back down to a 1.\\nORIGINAL POST: Wow. Just wow. JJ Abrams set up Rian Johnson with a great story to tell. Then he took the gem that was the Force Awakens\\, crumpled it up and discarded it. WTF???? WHO the F@#%# is Snoak? Are Rey's parents really junkers? If yes\\, F this franchise? Why did Luke have to die\/melt into the Force or whatever. Where are the knights of Ren?? WHO THE F#%$* is SNOAK? Why is Leia's #2 dressed like she's going to a casino in Monte Carlo? What?? Casino scene??? What was the point? And HOW did they not have Lando as the code breaker??  Lando would've been perfect. And NO Lightsaber on Lightsaber fight? WHY???? What is going on? There's so much more. How is Leia still alive\\, or WHY is she alive? So disappointed.","true":true}
