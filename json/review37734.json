Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was no character progression in this movie. Alot of key events just happen because \\\"reasons\\\" wheras alot of very obvious stuff is spelled out and re-iterated in painfully boring detail. The great villian lord Snoke or whatever was given no backstory and his death was very anti-climactic. I could go on at a greater length\\, but realizing what this series has sunk down to is just too painful and I rather forget. Needless to say I am donw with this.","true":true}
