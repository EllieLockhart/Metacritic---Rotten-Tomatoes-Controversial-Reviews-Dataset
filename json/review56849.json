Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There have been many complaints about this on the audience e side\\, however most of these complaints sound like they come from people who didn't pay attention or are just upset that they didn't get what they wanted. If you actually pay attention to the movie and are an actual Star Wars fan\\, you'll see that this is one of the best Star Wars film to date. The writing is suburb\\, the character development is superb\\, the list goes on.  I am excited that Rian Johnson took the turns he did. I love that he actually showed how strong the Skywalker blood line really is.  He also showed us that Luke has become the strongest Jedi to ever live because he did something no one has ever been able to do before him.  Please\\, don't let negative nancies keep you from seeing this amazing movie. And if you're upset about not getting the answers you wanted or the movie didn't go along with your theory\\, make up some new ones as we did when The Force Awakens didn't have all the theories we thought it would. May the Force be with you\\, always.","true":true}
