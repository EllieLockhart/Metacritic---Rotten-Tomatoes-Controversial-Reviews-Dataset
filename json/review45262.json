Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Updated to 1 Star\\, because I want my vote to count.\\n\\nThis movie is a disgrace and an insult to anybody with half a brain. Seriously\\, Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself. I can't believe this peace of s*** got a 91% certified fresh rating. Are the critics afraid or bought off by disney?","true":true}
