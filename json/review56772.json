Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The old hope died after the force awakened.\\n\\nSimply put\\, what an epically tragic waste of potential. \\n\\nOnly the great George R R Martin could deliberately leave his fans so completely disappointed. However\\, when he does it we're still left an abundance of possibilities and new characters worth investing our emotions in. \\n\\nWe can only imagine what the conversations were like at the writers table. \\\"Oh no\\, the fans have guessed all the best twists and turns!\\\" Says Writer One. \\\"Well\\, we'll just make it so every character is irrelevant and has no compelling back story!\\\" Says Writer Two. \\\"They'll love it!\\\" (Maniacal laugh) \\n\\nPoorly written\\, ineffective and out of place humor\\, wasted character potential\\, more plot holes than Chicago pot holes\\, constant logic fallacies\\, and just an underwhelming\\, boring segway between a movie that gave us hope and the movie we lost all hope for.","true":true}
