{"101487":104352,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any movie that have previous title must have consistency in their characters\\, stories and images. Star Wars is perhaps one of the best and successful film franchise in movie history. It contain deep and rich stories enhanced by not only the film itself\\, but from other entertainment media which include novel\\, comic\\, cartoon\\, game and more. That all said\\, The Last Jedi have completely ignored the consistency of the previous Star Wars history and have completely ruined not only the entire previous films\\, but also the characters. The film made it the long battle for democracy and peace from Episode 1 to 6 meaningless and indirectly made the rebel seem like a terrorist since no one have came to save the rebels in the end other then Luke and the falcon. This indicate that most people in the Galaxy look at the rebel alliance not as important to save\\, or may even think of them as terrorist of the Galaxy. Also the dramatic ending where everyone parade for the Empire's fall in episode 6 is wasted as well. After such great victory\\, the rebels would obviously gain very strong power yet it seems even after the death of the emperor and majority of the best fleet\\, it did very little to bring back democracy. Also most people complain about the classic character been treated like garbage and I say that is a fair complain. From episode 3 to 6\\, Luke  was always selfless and focused in saving his friend yet in this film\\, he literally do not care of the rebels even he heard of his best friend's death. Once Luke found his father was Vader\\, he risked his life to redeem him even after Vader did so much evil to the Galaxy. But for his nephew Ben\\, just because Luke saw a glimpse of dark side within him\\, he tried to kill him off. This is a huge disappointment since it is completely out of his character. Not only that\\, but Luke in the end decide to become force spirit while he should have stayed to help his sister Leia and confront Ben in episode 9 since Ben leaving was greatly Luke's fault (in this director's explanation). Not only the story makes no sense but all the actions of the characters makes no logical sense. Going to the new character\\, we have a selfish Chinese character (sorry I do not know the character's name and probably I will not waste my time to search for it due to her boring personality) who decide to ram his crush from dying just because she hope to be with him yet her action would have most likely killed them both and if Luke and falcon did not come to save the remaining rebels\\, she would have been responsible for the death of the entire rebels. Adding to not making sense\\, the light speed attack that was done to the First Order fleet in the end is a very obvious taboo to do. If such strategy was available\\, it would have been used from prior episode and therefore\\, such tactic should have been not allowed. This is complete disruption of consistency. IF light speed attack became magically available only from this film\\, they should have explained it and that would also cause a problem itself since the rebels should have just used their small ships to do the light speed attack on the First Order from the beginning. They did not need to use the insanely slow moving bombers. Rian Johnson not only did not understand anything about Star Wars\\, but he did not even understand his own story at all. The plot hole and inconsistency of this film is off the chart and even with the brand name Star Wars and the advertisement power of Disney was not able to fool the audience from seeing all the flaws Rian made. Lastly but not the least\\, every product is only good as it's fan allow it to be. Star Wars has been supported by fans for a very long time and they deserve respect by receiving a great story and character. But treating the previous film as it never meant anything and the beloved classic character so badly\\, it is destined that this film was going to be hated this much. Rian Johnson should have done far more homework before putting his step into something rich as Star Wars. He was completely unprepared and only thing he had was his ego that matches the current CEO of Lucas film which is Katherine who only care about money and not the fan who have been supporting this brand from the start. This film is an insult to the Star Wars community and it is almost a miracle that no one tried to stop it from happening. This film is a shame and pathetic created by people who have great ego and lack of love toward the legendary title. such a shame.","true":true}
