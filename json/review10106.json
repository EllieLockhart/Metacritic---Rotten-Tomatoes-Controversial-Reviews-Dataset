Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! Beautifully shot. Captivating and unexpected story. Developed the Star Wars mythos\\, demonstrating that lore from the books and other works do not have to determine the future of the franchise. Luke\u2019s philosophy was real with an honest reaction to tragedy. I loved the arc between Rey and Kylo! Excited for the future of the franchise!","true":true}
