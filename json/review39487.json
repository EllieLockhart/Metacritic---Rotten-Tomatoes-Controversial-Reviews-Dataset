Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film shames Star wars \\\" rich \\\" legacy\\, they might as well have re-made the wizard of oz with the witch playing Dorothy\\, Dorothy as the wizard\\, scarecrow as the witch in drag and so on. Ooops now I've gone and given RJ an idea for his next film?","true":true}
