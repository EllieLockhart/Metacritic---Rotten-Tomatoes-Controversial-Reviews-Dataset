{"101487":121365,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off let me say that the Last Jedi is not all bad and it had good sides to it. It did not feel a remake of one of the previous movies\\, it was visually stunning. The soundtrack was better\\, although the prequels still hold\\, in my opinion\\, the top 3 spots\\, Luke finally came back to the franchise\\, and the fight scene in Snoke's throne room is one of the best to date. I would also state that if this was a standalone movie\\, or a franchise that was entirely new starting with The Force Awakens\\, this would have been a great movie. Unfortunately\\, it is not. It is a part of a legacy that has always been about the epic fight between good and evil. It has given us iconic heroes\\, both male and female\\, who have been a part of every generation since 1977. Luke Skywalker has been and always will be my greatest movie hero. TLD portrayed him as a broken man who has been destroyed by self-doubt and a wavering moral compass\\, the same man who was considered insane for trying to redeem his father who at the time was one of the second most evil person in the galaxy. The whole subplot in TFA where Luke went in search of ancient knowledge that would benefit the galaxy was ignored. Although i liked the concept where they needed to evolve past the Jedi. Rey\\, a person who up until two weeks or so in movie time was still scavenging on another planet defeated a master Jedi and went from being drawn to the dark side to impervious to it. Her parentage\\, which was what made her so interesting\\, was just thrown away completely. The only Rey related aspect of the movie that I liked aside from the fight scene\\, was her deep connection to Kylo Ren Admiral Holdo\\, who could have been the next Admiral Ackbar\\, decided to play a social experiment on her ship because she didn't care if she was portrayed as a hero. I seriously doubt that they could not have come up with a better filler plot than that. This alone wasted a decent amount of movie time and made Poe\\, who is one of my favorite characters in the new trilogy\\, look like an idiot. Finn and Rose's trip to the Canto Bight was alright. It introduced a stunning new city\\, a new creature\\, a throwback to the Phantom Menace with the kids\\, and a new character\\, DJ\\, who can still have a big impact later on and become an interesting character. On the other hand it had no real impact on the storyline other than to offer a segue into Rose and Finn's romance. Phasma\\, a character that has been so advertised and had potential\\, was again dispatched just as fast as in the Force Awakens. I think that it is in the interest of every Star Wars fan to make this woman a real threat\\, a true rival to Finn that will make him rise up to the challenge and develop both as a character and a fighter. Instead\\, she lies in ashes. Snoke\\, who had the potential of becoming the new Emperor\\, although I wish one with a different temperament and motives\\, was dispatched just as quick as Phasma. Finally at the end\\, just when Luke returns from his exiles and offers a spectacle\\, he dies? I'd say that it could be possible that he died from exertion\\, but his sister\\, a person who is not as powerful as him\\, survived in the vacuum of space. I just hope he didn't die from a broken heart. I can't help but feel at times that Rian Johnson flipped the bird to JJ Abrams. The story continuation from the previous movie is poorly handled\\, and the whole significance of the original trilogy\\, the movies that MADE the franchise is disrespected to say the least. As a guy who has been a fan of Star Wars since I can remember being able to watch films\\, I am disappointed by the story of this movie. The Last Jedi could have been a modern movie that related to the current ongoing politics\\, as many seem to want in movie\\, and still stay very true to it's history. Rose could have been made a resistance member hell bent on action and revenge against the first order and Finn as someone to balance her. Poe could have been utilized much better than to just run around clueless. Leia could have been given an epic send off and look kept around a bit longer. This movie it seems marks the beginning of the end of the Skywalkers and the end of Star Wars as we know it. Disney will probably keep making new anthology films\\, but at the end\\, this whole Universe was created to tell a story about a man who had been seduced by the dark side and power\\, his son who is devoted to redeeming him and saving the galaxy\\, and finally leaving a family legacy that will last for years to come. Alas\\, it has been turned into a movie pertinent to the ongoing social climate by people who care little about Star Wars and care a lot about money.","true":true}
