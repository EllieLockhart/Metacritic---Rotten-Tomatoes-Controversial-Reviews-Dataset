Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found this to be a very action packed film with plenty of funny moments and amazing visual effects. The different story threads were very moving and there was plenty of character development. The ending however makes me wonder if there will be any original characters left besides Chewbacca and the droid characters. Job Williams score is perfect and it moves each scene perfectly.
