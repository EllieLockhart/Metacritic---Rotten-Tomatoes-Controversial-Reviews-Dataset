Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was terrible.  Just abysmally awful.  Not just as a Star Wars movie; but as a movie in general.  The story made no sense\\, the movie couldn't pick what movie it wanted to be (is it a comedy? is it a drama? is it a space opera?  Will it jarringly bounce between these all at the same time?  The answer to that is yes.)\\n\\nThe movie itself is so logically inconsistent it hurts.   Stop trying to make all your movies Guardians of the Galaxy.  Just work with what you have! Or at least stop dragging another franchises name through the mud.\\n\\nThe only positive in this movie was that it was visually stunning.  Beautiful to look at.  But everything else was pure shit.","true":true}
