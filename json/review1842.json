Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As exacerbating as it is exhilarating\\, the film zigs and zags between internal and external battles in a way that taxes its watchability and its own logic\\, and while its messages of finding unity within division and subverting expectations are clear\\, it takes extreme delight taking its sweet time making those points rather redundantly.","true":true}
