Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really tried to like this movie. It was visually stunning and beautiful and every frame was flawless. Sadly that is the only good thing about this sorry excuse for a star wars film. The political input\\, plot holes\\, and destruction of the original trilogy characters is so egregious that I honestly don't even think my love for this franchise can handle it. I watch movies to be entertained and to see an interesting story unfold\\, not to be subjected to propaganda and porgs.","true":true}
