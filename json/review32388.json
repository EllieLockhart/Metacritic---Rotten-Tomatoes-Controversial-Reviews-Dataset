Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dead. Long Live Star Wars.\\nI feel like someone read the script\\, looked at the director and said \\\"Every word you wrote is wrong\\\"\\, and the only response the director had was to add that to the film too. The movie left massive plot holes open\\, it dragged politics into it\\, and every single dramatic moment you have waited for was either played for laughs or was a complete letdown. I cannot even begin to say how much I despise this trash.","true":true}
