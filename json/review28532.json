Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably my favorite star wars movie\\, I created this rotten tomatoes account just so I could leave a review on this one. The movie was so action packed and unique\\, every turn left me completely  geeking out.","true":true}
