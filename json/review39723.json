Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great film and one of my favorites of the Star Wars franchise. Part of what I loved is that all of the fan theories turned out to be false. The movie stands on its own and does not need to fulfill every fanboys vision of what must happen. Not all of the questions are answered and that is okay. That's how life works. And I liked that each of the main characters develop within their own story arc: Poe learns how to lead\\, Finn learns what is worth fighting for\\, Rose learns how to be a hero\\, Leia finally shows force skills\\, Etc. I loved this film.","true":true}
