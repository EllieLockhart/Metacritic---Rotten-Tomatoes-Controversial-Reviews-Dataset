Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was disappointing at best\\, the gameplay\\, and the looks were stunning but the story didnt make up for it\\, as it dumbed down from the first making it all feel pointless. The start was strong but the last nearly 75% dropped down in quality as it goes on. Trying to make you sympathize an antagonist can be great\\, but naughty dog has done it in a terrible way where it just makes you despise the antagonist more and feel more sympathetic to Marlene. The story is just disappointing and a massive step down from the nearly perfect narrative of the original. This might be the biggest disappointment to me and maybe of this entire year so far\\, its a shame to see naughty dog go from the great things of uncharted 2\\, the perfect conclusion with uncharted 4\\, and one of the greatest narratives of all time with last of us\\, dumbed down to this big mess. Get the game on sale is my verdict\\, but even then\\, be prepared for disappointment in narrative.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
