Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not only showing you can actually make an original Starwars movie without using the same plot from a movie from the original trilogy *cough cough The Force Awakens cough cough* Starwars: The Last Jedi has an balanced amount of epic\\, memorial scenes and also (surprising) comedy thanks to the late Carrie Fisher. This movie could have been PERFECT if there weren\u2019t unnecessary scenes (I\u2019m looking at you shirtless Kyle Ren). Other than that this movie doesn\u2019t fall short and is worth seeing ","true":true}
