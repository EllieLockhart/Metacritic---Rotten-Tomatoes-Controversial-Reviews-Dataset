Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Feels exhausted\\, rehashed and struggling for new direction. I really loved Rogue One\\, but with this film I couldn't help feeling like I didn't care. Dialogue felt false and trashy. I felt cheated with the logic of how 'the force' worked. The plot and character reasoning just felt a bit basic and I left the theatre feeling bored and frustrated with it.","true":true}
