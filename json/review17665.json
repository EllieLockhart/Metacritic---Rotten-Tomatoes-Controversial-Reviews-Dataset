Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I suspect this film will grow on my upon further viewings. I actually might step back and debate things less for episode IX. So much happens in this film it's difficult to take it all in on the first viewing. The opening sequence is so great. Even though I felt like the CB scenes with Finn\/Rose were the weakest part of the film it still was full of great moments.","true":true}
