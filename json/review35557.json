Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a beautiful disappointment.  It simultaneously tears down the Original Trilogy while it copies from it.  The story in a nonsensical mess that could have greatly benefited from proper editing. The cast while generally well acted is filled with unnecessary characters who bring nothing to the film.  In some ways\\, it acts more like a parody of a Star Wars film than an actual Star Wars film.  New fans of the franchise will likely enjoy it but old fans who have lived with some of these characters for decades will leave as bitter as our once favorite hero.","true":true}
