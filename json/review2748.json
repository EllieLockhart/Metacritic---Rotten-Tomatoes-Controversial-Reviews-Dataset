Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. I kept clear of all news for days but read reviews in preparation for the last jedi. This is quite possibly one of the worst films I've seen for a long time! What is the plot? Why are the laughs so forced? Do I care about any of the characters? Bad from start to end\\, feels like the franchise is prepping for the next gen of kids and toys. Everything great about SW is now gone. Adam Driver's performance is the only thing stopping me from giving this half a star. He's fantastic!","true":true}
