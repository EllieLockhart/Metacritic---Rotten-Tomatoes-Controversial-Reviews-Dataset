Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Be aware people.  The hack from the farce awakens has written the script for episode 9 in 10mins and stating he cares nothing for any of the negative feedback from TLJ. Episode looks to be another masterpiece of writing. Pro women movement and all crap will continue and whats more scary is this hack in TLJ is writing the next trilogy after episode 9 the crapfest continues.","true":true}
