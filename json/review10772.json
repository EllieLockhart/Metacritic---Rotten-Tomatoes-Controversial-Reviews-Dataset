Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nFleshed-out\\, well-rounded characters driven by excellent writing and franchise best performances from the majority of the cast. Staggering attention to detail\\, creating a truly spectacular and intimate look at the galaxy far\\, far away. Thematic and moral complexity way beyond anything we've seen before. All this and the most visually striking entry into the series?\\n\\nDon't listen to to the whiny fans. \\n\\nTHIS is Star Wars.","true":true}
