Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi left me feeling confused and ultimately disappointed. It never truly drew me in to its story over its two-hour run time\\, and many times during the screening I caught myself wishing the film would already wrap up. \\nThe biggest problem I have with it is the tone - many of the \\\"jokes\\\" felt out of place and plainly mean. I also felt that the establishing force-connection between Rey and Kylo Ren was just an odd\\, filmatized version of some Skype call. As a plotpoint and story-telling device it just dragged on for way too long\\, and overall felt very out of character as to what we had learned of Rey in The Force Awakens. Reducing Finn\\, the male-lead of Episode VII\\, (as well as Poe) to naive\\, impulsive tools for 'comedic-relief' was frankly huge waste of time and great characters and their actors. I truly was looking forward to director Johnson to give Finn and Poe proper story arcs - instead we got no mentionable development whatsoever. Also\\, Finn's life-threatening light sabre wound (which put him into a coma\\, mind you) was literally shrugged off with a \\\"haha\\, he's naked in a bacta-suit\\\" -joke. After that the wound and its highly plausible after-effects were completely forgotten.\\nThere are many more irks and unanswered questions I have after The Last Jedi - questions that should've been answered during 152 minutes. It's highly unlikely I'll watch this film again anytime soon. And if I do\\, I'm definitely not paying for it.","true":true}
