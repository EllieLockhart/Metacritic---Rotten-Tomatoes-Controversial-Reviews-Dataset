Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's really half a thirty percent film\\, half an eighty percent film.\\n\\n The course of events surrounding snoke\/kylo and luke\/rey were very well done\\, With Kylo truly showing his power and Luke also making masterful strokes.\\n\\nSadly\\, erstwhile the Poe\/Holdo and Finn\/Rose events are terrilbly put together\\, largely inconsequential. Worse yet\\, in terms of the Poe\/Holdo cruiser bits\\, don't make sense even within the universe ascribed in this episode\\, let alone the rest of the series.\\n\\n It earns one star because while it's closer to the 56% rating it has earned thus far\\, that's really an unacceptable result for a star wars movie.","true":true}
