Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Instead of sticking with what works\\, they took the empire strikes back and did a scene for scene opposite film. If that wasn't bad enough\\, they sprinkled in liberal themes throughout the movie! How can anyone be ok with Chewbacca going vegan?!? This movie is a fail on so many levels. Sad","true":true}
