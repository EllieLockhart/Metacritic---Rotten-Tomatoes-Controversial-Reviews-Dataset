Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The technical side of the movie is good\\, obviously because of the funding. The actors play their terribly written characters good\\, obviously because most of them (except the purple haired one) are good actors. \\n\\nBut the story is absolute shit on fire. It stinks to the core. The shittiest use of character cliches who are for the most part Mary Sues mixed with very shitty dialogue which not only stinks of lack of imagination but also succeeds in being terribly preachy. \\n\\nIt also tries to force a political agenda down the audience's throats\\, but fails miserably since it's done too amateurish and lacks any form of imagination. \\n\\nTerrible\\, terrible\\, terrible. I won't even give it a full star\\, half a star it is. And the half is because Luke simply played a role in this movie (and not a terribly good one).","true":true}
