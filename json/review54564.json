Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going thru the audience \\\"reviews\\\" at Rotten Tomatoes for \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" and I don't think I can put into words just how depressingly idiotic most of the negative reviews actually are. First off\\, no surprise\\, basement dwelling fedora wearing MRAs are still annoyed that women are front and center in these films. As far as those people go\\, I think Triumph put it best. \\\"Spoiler alert: you are going to die alone.\\\" \\n\\nSecondly\\, a joke that falls flat\\, a plan that doesn't work or an event that's a bit of a stretch doesn't qualify as a \\\"plot hole\\\"\\, so spare us your two paragraph dissertation on Force projections because you missed a line of dialogue and\/or don't grasp foreshadowing. I mean\\, one of these \\\"reviewers\\\" actually believes that because a course of action by certain characters that comprises a good 25 minutes of the film ultimately fails\\, that that therefore means that sequence was \\\"wasted\\\". Newsflash: there is no dramatic tension in a story if every course of action our heroes undertakes is a success. Maybe stick to video games? \\n\\nI could go on but anyone who has mentioned Star Wars \\\"Prequels\\\" in my presence knows that I won't hesitate to take a hard look at the movies that comprise my most beloved franchises\\, and by \\\"hard look\\\" I mean crack open their conceptual skulls and feast on the thematic goo inside. So trust me when I say that Riann Johnson has crafted a more than worthy addition to the \\\"Star Wars\\\" franchise\\, and that it's filled with fun\\, drama\\, action and even a heady concept or two. \\n\\nGo see it.","true":true}
