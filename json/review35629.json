Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a mess from top to bottom and it signals the beginning of the end of Star Wars. The Force Awakens was a lazy rehash\\, but it didn't do anywhere near as much damage as The Last Jedi does to the characters\\, the universe\\, and the story. If you care at all about the original trilogy\\, its characters and what they accomplished\\, or wanted any of the plotlines that The Force Awakens started to have satisfying continuations or conclusions\\, do not watch this movie. Either Rian Johnson gets off on nonsensical 'gotcha' twists\\, or he actively hates Star Wars and the universe's rules and internal logic.\\n\\nSo does this movie do anything right? Well\\, it's *looks* nice\\, I guess? I just can't give many points to a movie for being the cinematic equivalent of dangling keys of in front of the audiences faces.","true":true}
