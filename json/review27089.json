Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most trope riddled\\, poorly written\\, and poorly directed movies I've ever watched. So many parts of this movie serve zero purpose to the story\\, to the point where if the adorable porgs had all said \\\"Buy me! Buy me!\\\" they would have hadone a more significant roll in the film. Director and writer Rian Johnson seems to conflate things like giving a character a stutter and an \\\"everyone's out for themselves\\\" attitude for creating an actual character. Lore items that have never been mentioned before this movie get introduced and removed as if the audience is supposed to feel something for them. I can only think Rian Johnson's goal was to make a Star Wars movie so bad that the prequel trilogy would be redeemed by comparison.","true":true}
