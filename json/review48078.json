Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the film was beautifully made\\, the writing fell short. Jokes fell short\\, character had no depth\\, and I found myself losing interest. The film was choppy to say the least and ending ended in a lighter mood despite the turn the story took.","true":true}
