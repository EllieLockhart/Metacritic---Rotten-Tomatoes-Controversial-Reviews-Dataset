Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you Mr.Johnson that you destroyed a whole generation`s love for the Star Wars universe. Thank you for making a Hollywood money cow with incoherent story where vital questions are not just left unanswered\\, but made irrelevant. Thank you for making a movie where it`s  hard to decide whether it was written for toddlers or adults\\, with its out of place comedy elements but with ever present soft toy characters. Thank you for destroying Luke Skywalker`s character which proved to me that you did not bother watching the first trilogy.Thank you I say\\, because you saved me all the money I would have spent on future Star Wars movies. ...And you George Lucas? I wonder how it must feel for you seeing your brainchild\\, your legacy dismantled and losing the fanbase which made this franchise really great...or I guess it`s enough counting your money. Anyway... WELL DONE Mr Johnson...Or more like just...DONE.          \\nPs. The Looper director directing\/writing Star Wars? Seriously? That is the real comedy element.","true":true}
