Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, lazy writing\\, and the discarding of what would be key characters without them conteibuting to the story leaves this as a poor entry into saga. \\n\\nSolid special effects and some nice injections of of humor make this a watchable film just nothing special. I would rank it above ep 1&2 but below all the rest. \\n\\nCasual fan- Definitely go see it. \\nHardcore fan- Temper your expectations. \\nDiehard fan- You will leave the theater a little angry or depressed.","true":true}
