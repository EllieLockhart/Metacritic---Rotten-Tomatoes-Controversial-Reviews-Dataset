Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was as \\\"Star Wars\\\" a movie as they could have made. This movie advanced the plot\\, had some brilliant character development\\, and stunning visuals. \\n\\nAt this point\\, it's almost impossible to surprise me - but this movie had some fun surprises. \\n\\nIs it perfect? Of course not! But it's definitely better than all the prequels\\, and it sets us up well for the 9th movie.\\n\\nI've been a huge Star Wars fan\/nerd for over 30 years - this met and exceeded all my expectations.","true":true}
