Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD***\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel like some  things that were bad about this movie were how quickly they killed off Snoke and how little he was in it; he should have been such a big role and could\u00e2(TM)ve done more. Also I think that the whole Rey going to the dark side thing and her training should\u00e2(TM)ve been further developed\\, and I think It was disjointed a bit because Rian Johnson came in with It set up for him\\, but he had the freedom to make It how he wanted and in some ways he seemingly disregarded the intentions Abrams had for it(like killing Snoke so soon)\\, which is all great and i love the direction he took this movie in\\, and the flare he brought to the series. However it  seems like he was forced to end It the way he did because It was rushed and differently toned then the rest of the movie. I\u00e2(TM)m interested to see where Abrams goes from here in 9. I really liked it I just feel like It could\u00e2(TM)ve been better. Despite this\\, the rest of the movie was incredible; especially the visual effects\\, fight scenes\\, and hilarious moments throughout. I think that the dynamic between Rey and Kylo throughout the movie was great\\, and i look forward to seeing this be developed further in 9. Overall\\, despite its troubles\\, the last Jedi accomplishes Johnson\u00e2(TM)s goal of making his mark on the Star Wars universe\\, showing that not all things have to be the same as they used to be\\, and that moving on from the old and entering into the new is important. These themes helped create a Star Wars movie that is unlike the others\\, defying the expectations that were set for it and moving away from the old and embracing the new. So I\u00e2(TM)d say it\u00e2(TM)s my 2nd favorite movie in the franchise and I\u00e2(TM)d rank it 94%","true":true}
