Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would rate this movie higher if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it was so disappointing and was part of such a beloved franchise. Props to cinematography\\, score\\, acting and some nice nods to the OT\\, but the sloppy writing\\, plot holes\\, out-of-character moments\\, the fact that some of the plot was entirely irrelevant and that there were NO FUCKING LIGHTSABER DUELS made me leave the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth. Was it watchable? Sure. Do I think it stacks up to the OT? Hell nah.","true":true}
