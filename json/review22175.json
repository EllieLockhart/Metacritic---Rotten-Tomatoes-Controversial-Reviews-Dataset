Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kylo Ren is still a 2nd-rate childish villian. Wtf? Rey is apparently a nobody. How boring and basic. Wtf? Somehow Rey is amazing with a lightsaber in this movie yet sucks in the force awakens. She never got any training. Wtf? Luke commits suicide. WTF?!? Finn attempts to commit suicide. Wtf? Rose commits suicide to save finn's life. Wtf? Admiral Holdo commits suicide. Wtf? Paige commits suicide. Wtf? ","true":true}
