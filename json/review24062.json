Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Matter does not fall in space. Matter does not slow down in space. When the fuel runs out you stop accelerating but keep traveling at the same velocity. The entire premise of the movie is not worthy of a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
