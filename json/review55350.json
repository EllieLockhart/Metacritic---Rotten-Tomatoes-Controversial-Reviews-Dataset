Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of big plot holes and poor writing\\, but worst of all was terrible continuity between TFA and this. TFA ends with the rebellion scoring a major victory and this starts with them on the brink of annihilation. Carbon copying the overall arc between 4 and 5\\, but not managing to pull it off. The humor raised a smile but i didnt laugh. Some scenes were pointless and did nothing to advance characters or plot. The worst thing for me was anti climaxing on characters\\, almost like it was done just for the claim of being \\\"original\\\"or edgy\\, but it ends up feeling pointless. Also the logic in disposing of some characters is vague and wishy washy. Dying without injuries is just a cop out. It was an average movie\\, but I think I actually like the clone wars better. But then\\, i didnt have such a downer on the prequels and may warm to this on re watching.","true":true}
