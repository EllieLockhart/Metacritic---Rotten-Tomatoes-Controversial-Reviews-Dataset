Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went two times at the cinema for this movie\\, and the good things are clear\\, visual effects\\, cinematography\\, but I am in conflict with the script\\, because I like it but the finn-rose story was bad\\, I think they could do another story with the characters and that could have been better.\\nI liked DJ\\, because he was a \\\"small character\\\" but he shows the duality between light and darkness\\, and I loved it\\, I loved the silence for some seconds almost at the end\\, it shows sacrifice and hope\\, the scenes between Rey and Luke was good\\, not perfect\\, but good. The almost Finn sacrifice was good\\, they could have done this scene more powerful\\, but they didn't\\, and the thing I loved the most was the connection between rey-kylo because that is what the new trilogy is about\\, light\\, darkness and hope\\, and they do represent that\\, they show us that you don't have to take the whole control of the universe to represent the dark side\\, you can show that in other ways\\, and that's maybe the thing why fans didn't like the movie\\, because of the changes\\, anyway\\, Leia using the force was awesome\\, Luke drinking milk wasn't necessary\\, I loved the purple haired girl\\, and we need to see more captain phasma.\\nOk\\, it's all said\\, I just have to wait for the last episode to see if this movie really worth it.","true":true}
