Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a steaming pile of poo! Who is Snokes? Why do we care?! How does Finn have such detailed knowledge of all the First Order's bases and ships?! What new revelations are revealed to us about the force? This movie goes no where fast! The fight scene between Finn and Phasma?! What a joke!","true":true}
