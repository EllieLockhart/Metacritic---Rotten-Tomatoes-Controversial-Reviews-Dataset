Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi. The movie is a poem about the force and tries to help us see precisely why people are drawn to the dark side. The only let down I had was that I had hoped we'd get a Snoke origin story as an ancient being who has managed to continue existing throughout history\\, and this character was cast aside pretty quickly. That said\\, I really loved how the movie dealt with Luke\\, and other major characters. It's important to remember that this is one chapter of a saga. This is not the entirety of the story\\, it's a piece of it. The movie sets out to create its own identity\\, and I believe it's a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
