Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Won't go into detail as so many others have\\, but as a lifelong Star Wars fan since seeing A anew Hope in theaters as a wide-eyes 12 year old this film\\, despite a couple of unnecessary scenes\\, delivered the goods. Kudos to Mark\\, Carrie\\, Daisy and Adam for inspired performances. Don't buy all the bluster of the OT fans saying that this film has \\\"ruined their childhood\\\"; I was there\\, from the beginning. I know Star Wars pretty well. This is a very\\, very good film in the series with plenty of exciting sequences and lots of twists.","true":true}
