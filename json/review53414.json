Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disliked the Prequels\\, but at least George Lucas had some self awareness that the audience would like a lightsaber fight from Yoda. All this hype to get to Luke Skywalker in the TFA AND all the potential Special effects in this day and age and we don't even get a taste or see a fraction of his power? I'm sure projecting yourself across the galaxy is pretty powerful\\, but give him a green lightsaber and let him do some damage like his father was so famous for.  Disrespect to Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
