Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This review is for the die hard Star Wars fans. The movie was horrible!!!!!! They took scenes from THE RETURN OF THE JEDI & THE NEW HOPE. You would think Disney writers can come up with a somewhat decent story line. Instead they threw a bunch of crap together and called it a Star Wars movie. But for you new guys watching this saga\\, you may enjoy it. Throw a bunch of light and special effect your happy.","true":true}
