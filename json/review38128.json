Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The strongest Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back! It has more heart and character driven plot than all the other films. Its made me laugh and cry intensely. At the very least it is a visually stunning masterpiece! Certain scenes left me utterly breathless. Most importantly\\, the core thesis of the film is so inherently what Star Wars is about and leaves both old and young with an inspirational lesson\/ message: The fight is not about defeating your enemies\\, it's about saving those you love! This is the type of message I want my children learning.","true":true}
