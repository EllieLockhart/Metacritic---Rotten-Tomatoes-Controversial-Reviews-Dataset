Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film requires an open mind from Star Wars fans. It's an original take on the Star Wars franchise and one that took me two viewings to really appreciate. With small issues that could have been refined\\, this film overall is a great inclusion to the franchise. It expands the lore that has entertained audiences for decades and does well to surprise its fan base\\, but none the less is an extremely entertaining film\\, providing the fun and nostalgic feel that warms the heart of so many Star Wars fans.","true":true}
