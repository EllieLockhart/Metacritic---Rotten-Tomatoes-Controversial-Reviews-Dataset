Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it\\, but the pacing was odd and some scenes could have been cut ( the milk scene) for better moments i.e they cut a scene of b88 showing finn a recording of rey saying goodbye to him like that would have added more feeling to the movie. The humor throws off the serious moments and they could have used john boyega and oscar issaac in much better ways. I thought the movie was very grim and not kid like at all. I think a better editor could have fixed 80% of what I don't like about this movie.","true":true}
