Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a major Star Wars fan. I came into this movie with some knowledge on the universe but not enough for me to care about continuity errors or many of the characters. Even then\\, this movie was not only a bore to sit through\\, given that the story could have been told in 50 minutes\\, but it offers nothing that other Star Wars movies don't already do. Many of the characters are incompetent and one-dimensional\\, the special effects\\, for the most part\\, aren't anything snazzy and border on bad\\, and the story is so padded you'll be glancing at your watch wondering when the movie will be over. At least \\\"that one scene\\\" (avoiding spoilers but everyone should know it) with Admiral Holdo is gorgeous. It's a filler movie\\, and a bad one at that. Can't believe critics rated this so high\\, don't know what they saw that I didn't.","true":true}
