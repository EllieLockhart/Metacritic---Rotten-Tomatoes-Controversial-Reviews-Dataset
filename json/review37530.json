Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reason this movie is getting bad reviews is:\\n1. Force Awakens set up a lot of things that Johnson simply did not want to be follow up on\\n2. Too many theory crafters are mad because they didn't get the pay offs they spent the last 2 years losing sleep over\\n3. People have unreasonable expectations and everyone's a critic\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, I had my own theories of who Rey's parents were and who Snoke actually was\\, but you cant hate on a movie because you didn't get the payoff you wanted. This movie definitely had different tone than the other movies. I was hoping for a little more out of the story\\, but to say that this movie wasn't visually stunning or that the story itself was predictable is wrong. The story took us places some people could not even imagine\\, and it was beautiful journey along the way. Sure\\, it wasn't the best film of the franchise\\, but everyone is getting way too defensive. Does it all make sense? No. But\\, does traveling through light speed really make sense either? Time to calm down everyone....","true":true}
