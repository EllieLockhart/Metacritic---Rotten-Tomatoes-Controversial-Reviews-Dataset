Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars movie since Empire. Better than Rogue One\\, and I really liked Rogue One. Emotional\\, risky\\, full of epicness and use the nostalgia where it\u2019s needed. It uses a little moments of surprises that leads to a surprise end. It\u2019s the perfect end to an era and the beginning of a new one. ","true":true}
