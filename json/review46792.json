Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well... if Disney wanted to shake things up\\, change the franchise in a bold new way\\, and let go of the past\\, they succeeded. (Spoiler: That is exactly what they wanted to do\\, and the director has said so.) \\nIf they wanted to make a movie for the 40-55 year old crowd of true star wars fans who grew up with Luke\\, Leia\\, Han\\, and Chewy... ya... not so much.\\nThe movie gets 3 stars... well...because it's star wars. As soon as you put a lightsaber and the Millennium Falcon on the screen\\, you are at least decent. But for me ( a huge Star Wars geek who claims the original as my favorite movie of all time)\\, this move fell short in so many ways. If only Disney would pick writers and directors who \\\"get it.\\\" \\nIt's not all bad\\, and there are plenty of parts that scratch the itch\\, but there are so many stretches and bad leaps in this movie that you just have to shake your head.","true":true}
