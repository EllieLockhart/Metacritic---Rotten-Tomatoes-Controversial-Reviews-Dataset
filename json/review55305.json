Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Life long fan of star wars. This is the first star wars movie that I will not purchase for home. I have no idea how they completely missed mark on this film\\, or how the critics have praised this as an amazing movie. Trust me\\, I get where they were going and I am certainly no criic of refreshing a tired story with a new idea. However the execution of it is so BORING. I was looking at my watch wondering when this movie would be over within the first 30 minutes. The amount of wasted time on completely irrelevant details and idiotic \\\"non-plot\\\" development activity is staggering. This does not even come close to mentioning the entire tonal shift between Episode VII and VIII...it is as though they decided to ignore any of the breadcrumbs left behind and decided just to produce a vision ignoring the greater cinematic universe. And seriously\\, you have decided that the main antagonist for the remainder of the trilogy will be an individual that has no imposing characteristics of any kind and has been defeated outright\\, at least once\\, by the protagonist. There is no gravitas or realistic possibility of defeat of the protagonist in the future which completely undermines any potential for build up and worth telling story. \\n- Just a tip\\, if you are going to make a movie....do better","true":true}
