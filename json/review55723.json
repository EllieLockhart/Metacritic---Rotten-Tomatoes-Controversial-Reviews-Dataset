Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word filled my thoughts as the credits scrolled by\\, disappointment. This movie was terrible\\, from every conceivable perspective. From a plot and story perspective\\, from a character development perspective\\, from a source material perspective and so on. I had bought two screenings in advance when tickets went on sale. One for myself\\, and a set for me and my kids. It was a harrowing thing to know I had to watch it a second time after the first\\, but I had been told that people who saw it a second time liked it more. I didn't. It made it worse.\\n\\nIn fact\\, the more I thought about the movie\\, the more I hated it. I'd like to go into great detail on this\\, but that may have to wait another day.","true":true}
