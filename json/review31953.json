Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers: a bloated movie made for the sake of twists had so many poorly developed characters and illogical story-lines.  Massive plot holes such as gravity bombing in space. Fleets run by reactors running out fuel after 1 hyperspace jump. All-powerful bond-movie like villain that can do anything except for seeing the lighsaber next to him spinning to point at him. Ghost forms that seems to go in and out of the physical realm are very inconsistent that made me question the writer\/director's work ethic.","true":true}
