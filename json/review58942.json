We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Firstly I\u2019m a huge fan of the first tlou\\, love everything about it\\, from its story\\, gameplay and characters! I loved it so much my daughter born in 2017 was named Ellie. Part 2 is a game I have been waiting to play since it\u2019s original tease back in 2016\\, and a game I was unsure if it should exists or not because of how much I love the first. This game however is a gruesome\\,dark\\,beautiful masterpiece! It\u2019s a fantastic piece of entertainment\\, exactly what you would want from any game\\, film or any form of entertainment if you were to watch or play. The trailers are misleading (classic naughty dog btw)\\, and the story goes in a way I was not expecting\\, but that\u2019s the whole point of this game. It intwines the first story with the seconds direction and push it somewhere the fans of the first where not expecting. What would be the point of making a game with the expectation this one carries with a story that was exactly what we expected would happen? It would be a boring\\, predictable and not enjoyable to play. Games and technology have moved on since the first\\, and making a sequel like this so long after the original\\, there would be so much to consider in terms of gameplay and story when making this game\\, and I personally couldn\u2019t be happier with how it turned out. I was gutted to lose such a loved character in the opening of the game as much as anyone\\, and new characters lost you grow to love over the course of this game too. Everyone is of course allowed their opinion\\, but the negative reviews this game is currently receiving from disappointed fans because of the above\\,I wouldn\u2019t recommend them watching game of thrones anytime soon. This game made me laugh\\,cry\\,happy and speechless\\, it\u2019s an unrivalled journey that only can compare to the journey of the first\\, but for totally different reasons. The gameplay is fluid\\, the graphics are exquisite\\, attention to detail is flawless\\, and the story is one that is meant to test\\, upset and surprise you\\, and it did for me.  This for me is a remarkable achievement in video games\\, and a testament to the quality of the work naughty dog produces without effecting my love for the first game. I will replay this game over and over and enjoy it every time. 10\/10 without hesitation.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
