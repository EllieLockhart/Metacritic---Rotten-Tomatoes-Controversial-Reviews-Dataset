Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars was terrible.  Only those who who graded this with any good ratings didn't read any of the books that came after The Return of the Jedi.  This Luke Skywalker was stupid.  As far as I am concerned\\, Disney is destroying the story of Star Wars.  And George Lucas sold all of his fans out.  These last two stories are all repeats of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.  Can't Disney use their own imagination and come up with something original.","true":true}
