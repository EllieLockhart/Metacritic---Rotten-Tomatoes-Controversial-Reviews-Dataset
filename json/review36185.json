Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was genius. The meta nods and Easter eggs to hard core fans and lore were subtlety awesome. This movie had so many thrills and feels\\, I love what Rian Johnson did with his first Star Wars movie.","true":true}
