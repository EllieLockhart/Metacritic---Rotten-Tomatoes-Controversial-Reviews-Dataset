Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An exceptional film with excellent acting and direction\\, but a lot of the middle could have been trimmed down in editing. This film took some significant risks in terms of plot and framing\\, and about 90% of those risks paid off. What worked\\, really worked - this film will stand up on it's own legs for years to come.","true":true}
