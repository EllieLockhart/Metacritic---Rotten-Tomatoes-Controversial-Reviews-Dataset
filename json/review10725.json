Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half a star for Joda being a puppet instead of CGI. This Joda reminds me of the old Star Wars movies. Rest of the movie is garbage. Actually\\, episode 1\\, 2\\, and 3 are not so bad compared to this movie. That's a pro as well.","true":true}
