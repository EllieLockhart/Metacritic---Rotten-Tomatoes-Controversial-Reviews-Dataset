Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who would imagine that the audience score for Star Wars: The Last Jadi would be less than the Justice League 80%? I mean... JL was bombed by the critics with 40% on tomatometer... Now Star Wars gets 93% from Critics and 56% and falling from audience! \\n\\nThe movie isn't any close to be good. It tries to be bigger than \\\"the force awakens\\\"\\, but it can't reach even EPISODE II. Too much characters. too much nonsense scenes (Luke drinking \\\"cum\/milk\\\")\\, and now we lost two of the most important characters... Just to give Rey and Ren some \\\"bright\\\".\\n\\nNah\\, I would skip it... If I haven't seen.","true":true}
