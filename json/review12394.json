Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe this was the best star wars episode since the originals. Yes I feel it needed to do better connecting to the force awakens but it told a very important story. It was different which is scary for the fan boys but I believe and look forward to where this story goes.","true":true}
