Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers maybe?) It is a terrible movie. This movie has very little to do with the previous movie. New director pretty much ignores everything that JJ Abrams did in the Force Awakens. The Leia scenes were terrible. Especially the \\\"Marry Poppins\\\" in space scene! The Luke Skywalker character is destroyed. He NEVER would have attacked his nephew. He tried to save Darth Vader after all. The Rose Fin romance makes very little sense. 12 hours then madly in love? Casino part didn't feel very Star Wars-ish. Luke dies but not in a cool way.\\n\\nMy gf also kept falling a sleep during the movie >.<\\n\\nIn short\\, this movie felt like if a Harry Potter movie had a baby with a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
