Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Chewbacca: used only for punchlines. Rey: talking to herself\\, looking in funhouse mirrors. Luke: grumpy old man\\, killed off. Poe: brash idiot\\, gets people killed. Ackbar: killed off screen. Phasma: zero development\\, killed off. Snoke: zero development\\, killed off. \\n\\nSomehow seeing BB-8 piloting a scout walker even made me hate BB-8.\\n\\nWhat emotion-rich action are critics referring to? Outside of that one amazing lightsaber fight\\, I was bored and angry. The whole movie felt sloppy and disjointed from everything that came before\\, and a big FU to anyone who cares about these characters.","true":true}
