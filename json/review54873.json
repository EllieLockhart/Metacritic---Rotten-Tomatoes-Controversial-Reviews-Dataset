Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a mess.  I'll say one positive thing about the film\\, a few scenes had beautiful cinematography.  Now addressing the \\\"padded amazing\\\" reviews posted a few days ago (June 13-16)\\, either done by trolls whereas it was funny or if it was done by Lucasfilm\/Disney then just when I thought they hit the bottom of the barrel as far as behavior they found another bottom.  The five-star reviews stating it was the best film ever made\\, etc by reviewers with names of that of dead Presidents (my God you are lazy) may be unprecedented.  Although this does prove you have little to no imagination as far as storytelling goes.  For the love of God\\, please put your energy into great film making again and steer clear of the agendas that we all go to the movies to escape from....thank You!                                                                                                                                                           PS: As one of the padded reviews had stated Id like to make a clarification.  RIan and bravo do not belong in the same sentence....at least not yet.","true":true}
