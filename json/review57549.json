Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not a good movie.  It wasn't even a mediocre movie.  This was literally a two and a half hour slog through the muck of drivel that was created by someone who apparently must have hated everything about the two previous trilogies.  The movie had some amazingly shot scenes and solid acting.  Unfortunately this was combined with idiotic slap-stick humor\\, heavy handed social commentary\\, and long segments that seemed to serve no purpose... all tied together with a ribbon of huge plot holes\\, and served up with a middle finger to everyone who was a fan of Star Wars of old.  \\n\\nIf the goal was to make a good Star Wars movie\\, it's a total fail.  If the goal was to ruin the franchise for everyone who was a fan (similar to the new Ghostbusters movie) than mission accomplished.\\n\\nI give it one star for production quality and acting.  Everything else was terrible.  I also believe that if you are a fan of Star Wars in general\\, that you avoid this move altogether and hope JJ Abrams can put the smoldering pieces back together again in the final film.","true":true}
