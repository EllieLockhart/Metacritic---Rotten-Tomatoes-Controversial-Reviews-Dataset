Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" this film attempts to be a bit more original\\, and I commend that. But the film's real problem is its constant struggle between originality and \\\"Being another Star Wars film\\\" is not much different than the film's own antagonist's struggle between good and bad. Following that analogy\\, is being a more original film \\\"Bad\\\"\\, and is \\\"making another Star Wars film\\\" \\\"Good\\\"? Find out in the next episode of Dragon Ball Z! (Exactly. That's how much sense this film really makes)","true":true}
