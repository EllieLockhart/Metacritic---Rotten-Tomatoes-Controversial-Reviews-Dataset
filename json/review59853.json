The first game had a lot of flaws but the story and the characters made it one of the best games I have ever played. The second one\\, rating it half way through\\, is not focused on the character development or a story but on shoveling you the agenda. The focus is not on a a real life development of a relations between characters but only on gay relationship that starts before the game and does not change even a bit through the game and is overshadowing everything else. It's just flat. The visuals and gameplay are much better than in the first game\\, but the dull relationship between the girls is very artificial and distracting. It's like this is the only thing that the writers wanted you to take from this game. No development\\, no character arc nothing. It's just anticlimactic.\redit:ok now finished it and it's just... awful. The story bad story and storytelling is overshadowing the games visuals. Its just terrible. Its not worth your time. This game has nothing to offer. Waste of time even writing about it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
