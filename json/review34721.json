Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The damage is done\\, the question is now what will Disney do to correct this injustice. Honestly I felt this movie was a huge slap in the face! Disney listen to the fans and stop ruining the Star Wars legacy.","true":true}
