Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you know me you know I'm not a big Star Wars fan not that I don't like the series I just never got into it.  I'm not a Star Wars nerd\\, I just watched the new movies as a casual watcher.   I never even seen the original trilogy.   But Star Wars: The Last Jedi was the movie that made me want to go back and see the original trilogy.\\nThis was a movie I got into more and more as each scene progressed.   In the beginning scene\\, I wasn't really invested in the story.   But by the end\\, I was captivated by all the characters and what was happening in the story.\\nAs much as I hate to admit it's true what they say about storytelling\\, character creation can make or break a story and it's what draws you to the plot.  \\nWith the opening scene I didn't really know who everyone was so I wasn't as invested in what was happening with everyone.   But as I got to learn who they were I got more and more interested in their position within the world.\\nThe Biggest complaint I had with The Force Awakens was that the new characters were underdeveloped.   Here there is much improvement on that.   The new characters have better and more concrete motivations\\, we learn more about their backstories\\, and there is a lot more emotional weight to their actions.  By the third act\\, I was rooting for all of them.\\nThe writing does a great job at adding clever stakes and tension to the story.   The story isn't as predictable as one would think it is.   There are times where you believe the characters actions will result in \\\"A\\\"\\, but instead\\, the movie takes a turn and the characters do something else that heightens the tension. \\nAs for everything else\\, the action and visual effects\\, they can range from average to good.   It's what you would expect to see in a Star Wars film\\,  nothing necessarily new or special about them.   Not to say that they're not memorable or cool because a lot of them they are.  However\\, many of my favorite action scenes come in the third act\\, when all of the characters motives and development are put to the test.\\nOne final thing I have to say is that even know I had been praising the characters in this movie\\, I still feel there's something missing when I'm watching all the characters.    And that's when it hit me\\, I feel like there's just something I don't know about the characters or the Star Wars' World.   What's going on\\, what's happening\\, what let all the characters up to this moment in the story.   And these questions can only be answered if I watched the original Star Wars trilogy in full.    The fact that this movie makes me want to go back to the previous movies and see what I missed\\, does say something about the movie itself.   This movie holds its own but also makes me want to become more invested in the Star Wars franchise as a whole\\, and that's a good thing.\\nI'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for the Star Wars movies\\, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the past hold on the Star Wars movies.  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great movie\\, go see it. and may the force be with you.\\n\\n4.2\/5 Stars","true":true}
