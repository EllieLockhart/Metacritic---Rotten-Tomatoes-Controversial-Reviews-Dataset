Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie humanized Luke Skywalker\\, showing that anyone can make mistakes and descend into depression. People hating on this are hating on realism. It's nice to see a dose of realism in a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nYes\\, the director messed with our expectations\\, but it made the movie much more enjoyable than The Force Awakens\\, which was nothing but a remake of Episode IV. Rian Johnson knows Star Wars tropes and he twisted them to deliver some truly surprising moments. Kudos for completely fooling me. It kept things interesting.\\n\\nBefore going in\\, curb your expectations and you might actually enjoy yourself.","true":true}
