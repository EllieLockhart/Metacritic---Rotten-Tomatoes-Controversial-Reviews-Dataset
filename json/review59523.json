But the story was horrendous. It was like game of thrones season 8 level bad ending.It's a 25 hour torture porn misery simulator where you're forced to brutally kill realistic dogs and play out the dumbest revenge plot of all time.It's a revenge story where you kill hundreds of people only to let the target of your revenge live because revenge is bad I guess. Then you go try to live a happy ending and decide 'oh wait revenge is good afterall.' Then you get to the target again and decide 'nevermind revenge is still bad.' This game is trash and I hate it.  This is coming from someone who loved Last of Us 1. Please don't support this trash game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
