Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When THE FORCE AWAKENS came out\\, i was really looking forward as to how jj abrams and disney will be able to implement something new in this franchise. At the end of the day\\, despite that THE FORCE AWAKENS was a kind of rip-off of A NEW HOPE\\, it still got me dwelling into deep thinking with all those unanswered questions and got me built some wierd theories. So logically i expected THE LAST JEDI to be as intriguing as THE FORCE AWAKENS. Alas\\, that was not the case at all. Rian Johnson tried his best but the plot was a total waste and a bit of a mess in the sense that in the end\\, THE LAST JEDI has taken the path of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Johnson tried his best to develop his character but wasted some of them badly: Rey has been established as being a powerful jedi but that sounds the same as luke's story and Kylo Ren has been showcased as being a tormented child missing parental love and having lost faith in everyone thus being full of nuances but linking that he could end up as vader. Finn could have been given a more significant importance(had they turned him into a jedi that would have been mind-blowing). It like they took the same concept of the iconic characters and simply reproduced them with fresh faces: Rey replacing Luke\\, Finn replacing Han Solo and Poe Dameron as the probable new leader of the rebellion taking the place of Princess Leia.\\nTHE LAST JEDI in the end does point at the creation of a new ' empire' and rebellion hence being again a repetition of the fist trilogy.I should conceed though that the movie does give the fans somethings to ponder over as to how the rebellion will reorganise itself and how the characters might end up and what could the galaxy look like with Kylo Ren as the new Sith Lord.Disney will have to find new ideas for the upcoming STAR WARS movies because if it continues like that\\, STAR WARS might really lose its charm and that would be devastating.\\n\\nAs a conclusion\\, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is entertaining but a copy-paste of the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK essence with a weak storyline\\, I'll give it a sad 3\/5.","true":true}
