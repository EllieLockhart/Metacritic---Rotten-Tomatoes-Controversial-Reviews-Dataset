Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The underlining theme of TLJ is that it's time for the masters to get out-mastered and to make way for a new generation of fans. This movie is the most visually captivating\\, there were gasps and awes from the theatre audience. It's not without its problems with Disney themes of love\\, teamwork\\, and hope hitting you over the head throughout the movie. But it leaves you fully satisfied. Star Wars is evolving much like it ought to\\, and I for one\\, am very much along for the ride.","true":true}
