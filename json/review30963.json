Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing. Agree with all the reviewers who described the tedious plot\\, lackluster characters\\, stupid devices (running out of fuel?! Kylo Ren doing beefcake?! Luke dies when his hologram is cut in half?!?!?)\\, and meaningless loose ends. Disney seems to think this franchise is now just about selling merchandise\\, hence pointless scenes of myriad unecessary characters to turn into action figures and soda cups. Sad addition to what was once a groundbreaking series.","true":true}
