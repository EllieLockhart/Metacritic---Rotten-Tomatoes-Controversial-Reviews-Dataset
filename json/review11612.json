Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible ... waste of time\\, politically correct casting of characters with pathetic killing off of everything inspiring in the original. I'm done. This was about the only theme to get me to even go to a movie in a theater now a days and it killed it for good. I'm done.","true":true}
