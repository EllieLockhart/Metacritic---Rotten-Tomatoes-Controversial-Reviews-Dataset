Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea how this movie received a 91% score from critics.  This movie was an embarrassment to the Star Wars saga.  If you enjoyed the prequels\\, such as the Phantom Menace\\, then you'll most likely enjoy this movie.  Rogue One was a far superior film and really gave true Star Wars fans what they wanted.  This movie was obviously controlled by Disney Executives and it seemed like their main goal was re-inventing the Star Wars universe and appealing to a brand new generation of fans; ones that are under 10 years old.","true":true}
