Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the TLJ twice to make sure I was not overreacting to the first viewing on Thursday.  TLJ is a bad movie and no I am not a Russian bot or troll.  When you decide to make a trilogy\\, the storylines from the previous movie must be answered\/revealed in the second and third movies\\, but with TLJ\\, Disney\/Kennedy\/Johnson made a stand alone movie with no intent with moving the story forward.  Finn and Poe's characters were not moved forward in this movie nor did it settle Rey and Snoke's backstory.  Rian states in an interview that Rey and Snoke's backstory is not important so let's ignore 40 years of Jedi\/Sith lore because you felt like a change.  Finally Luke and Leia's sendoffs were weak and really disrespected the character's history from the past 40 years.  I waited to post a review after I had some time to digest what I saw twice\\, but after reading numerous stories bashing audience reviews I knew what 50% of the people knew - TLJ is not a good movie.","true":true}
