Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were too many cutesy moments\\, non-convincing characters and plot lines that felt forced. It didn't feel cohesive and was possibly more disappointing that some of the episodes 1-3. I hope Episode IX will redeem itself.","true":true}
