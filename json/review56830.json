Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are no words\\, just no words\\, to describe how awful this movie is. I am also impressed with the detail at which other reviewers are writing in the comments which echo my sentiments\\, there seems to be broad consensus on just how bad this movie turned out.  I am just as gobsmacked at how anyone with even the smallest amount of common sense or appreciation for the original SW could like (or love) this movie let alone claim it is \\\"the best Star Wars ever\\\"\\, it is just so poorly written and directed\\, with a meandering plot\\, illogical plot holes\\, character assassination\\, poor character development\\, and corny\\, cringe-worthy\\, tension ruining\\, tone breaking jokes. \\n\\nIf you have a love of Star Wars and love what the original 3 movies were about\\, the struggle of good vid evil\\, the hero's journey\\, I.e. the core of what made Star Wars special\\, then you will want to avoid this movie like the plague.  The complete contempt of what Star Wars use to be is on full display and the writer actively seeks to destroy it. You will be disappointed.","true":true}
