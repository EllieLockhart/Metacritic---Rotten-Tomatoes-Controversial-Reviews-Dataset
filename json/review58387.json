Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it twice\\, and letting my thoughts on the movie marinate ... this movie is not good. In fact\\, I truly don't want to feel this way and even went THROUGH the stages of grief: first denial and I'm at bargaining\/acceptance Phase now. I rate this lower than the lowest star Wars fIlm: attack of the clones. \\nI will be making a fan edit of around 20 changes that remove some of the cringey humor\\, non star-wars moments and just awful decisions by the writer\/director.\\n\\nThinking of calling it the de-marvelized edition.","true":true}
