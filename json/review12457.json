Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe this is a canon star wars film. I have no idea what I just watched. I don't know who the characters are\\, and I have no idea if the story had any sort of setup or resolution. The whole film was a disjointed clip show of special effects. I have no idea if this film has anything to do with the last film except I see John Boyega and Daisy Ridley in it. So it's gotta be. All characters from last film are sidelined to keep introducing primary characters again. More characters are killed off in attempt to build empathy\\, but if you never introduce anything or anyone. You can't care about their loss. I don't know why this film was made. I'm not looking forward to seeing any more star wars films. Which is sad\\, as they used to be my favorite. If you want a good star wars story that's new\\, watch Star Wars Rebels\\, instead.","true":true}
