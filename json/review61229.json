Wasn't sure I was gonna love 2 as much as 1. Thought a basic revenge story would be boring. People on the internet are skimming through this game as if it were a reading assignment due the next day (it shows). The game tells a complex tale of coping with grief\\, challenging you to objectively humanize the enemy\\, and themes of evolving identity analogous to the first game. Along with a ton more that I know I missed on my first playthrough. If you are on the fence about playing this game stop reading reviews\\, stop watching content\\, just find a way to play the game yourself. The experience is powerful if you just allow yourself to experience it organically. Or... Continue to spread negativity and gain nothing but contempt from others I.e. post comments about a game you truly never attempted to care about in a futile attempt to get revenge for a plotline that you disagree with. The game won't change and you being mad about it does nothing about it sales figures 4 million copies in 3 days. Learn to move on.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
