Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Characters are way out of character. This films continuity doesn't really seem to fit in with the lore. Disney's trying to take something that isn't broken and make it better only ended up deconstructing a beloved galaxy far far away and made it bland and boring. Such a pitty with so much potential only to take a steep nose dive into oblivion a be forgotten. For the millions of fans out there I do not endorse this movie. Wish I hadn't paid so much to watch it. Pure let down.","true":true}
