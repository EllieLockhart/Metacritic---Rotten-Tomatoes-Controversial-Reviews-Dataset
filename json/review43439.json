Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was argueably the worst star wars movie I have ever seen. They completely ruined the old characters with entirely new and shitty personalities\\, they threw in a bunch of new charactes with no relatability and unexplained connections\\, and they kept trying to throw in cute creatures to make you feel sympathy for things that really didn't even need to be in the movie.","true":true}
