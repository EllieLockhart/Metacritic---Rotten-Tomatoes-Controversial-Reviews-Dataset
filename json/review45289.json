Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Useless\\, pointless rubbish.  Disney shat on Luke and made Leia a joke (It's a bird\\, it's a plane...it's SuperLeia).  Lame\\, lame\\, lame.  Rey went nowhere and Fin and Poe are treated to the white male = idiot needing the women to set them straight.  \\n\\nDisney and Rian Johnson you can shove your leftist agenda up your ass.  I really hated this abysmal dreck.","true":true}
