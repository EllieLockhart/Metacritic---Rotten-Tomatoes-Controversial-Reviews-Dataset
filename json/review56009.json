{"101487":166696,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously\\, what movie did these critics go watch? Any hardcore fan of the Star Wars franchise\\, please look at the audience reviews more than the critic reviews. This is literally the biggest discrepancy I've ever seen between the two on Rotten Tomatoes. Let me start off by giving my background: My first comic book that I ever bought was a Star Wars comic book. I've been a Star Wars fanatic since childhood. I've consumed everything from the movies\\, to comics\\, video games\\, animated series\\, and novels. From the now \\\"Legends\\\" era stuff like the Yuuzhong Vong War to the new \\\"canon\\\" materials like the Aftermath series and Thrawn Novel. This movie goes in such crazy direction with the Star Wars universe that its insulting and alienating to Star Wars fans. I'm probably completely done with any consumption of any Disney Star Wars material. And that's really hard for me to say. \\n\\nI'm not going to go into a lot of specific details and spoilers since the movie just came out. I'll probably update this later and do that once more people get to see it. Let me say this though\\, the main villain\\, Snoke\\, turns out to be a complete joke. Everyone knows that a great villain makes a movie. Darth Vader in the original trilogy\\, joker in batman\\, Kevin Spacey's character in Seven\\, Hannibal Lecter. Most insulting to fans though is how awful they make Luke. We never get to see an all powerful Jedi master Luke. This is in complete contrast to the rest of the saga\\, and the direction George Lucas intended for the character. In interviews\\, Lucas made it known that he foresaw Luke becoming the most powerful Jedi ever. He was to become the realization of Anakin's potential. The EU fleshed this out pretty well. This movie not only doesn't make that happen\\, it makes him laughably far from that. Further more\\, Rey as a character suffers from the \\\"Mary Sue\\\" trope. She's far too overpowered\\, far too quickly. And lastly\\, Disney tried to make this similar to Guardians of the Galaxy or one of its Marvel franchises with too much forced in cringe worthy slapstick humor. Its not the right tone for the Star Wars universe at all. I almost walked out of the theater before the end\\, and I made sure to give it some heart felt boos. This movie has worse audience\/fan reviews than Phantom Menace. That's all I really need to say.","true":true}
