Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Typical Disney film ticks all the diversity boxes but ultimately fails to deliver any real story as it tries to accomodate too many story lines rather than focusing on a delivering a coherent narrative focused on core characters. It takes no real creative risk and to many felt like a rehash of used story lines and tropes already explored within the Star Wars universe. Key existing characters were simply not developed nor explored meanwhile the film introduces an assortment of new characters who assist in key plot points but whom are discarded just as quickly as they were introduced. The central part of the story seemed more like a detour than anything that added value to the core motifs of the film and essentially left audiences wishing editing had focused more deeply on other well established relationships and conflicts. Numerous plot faults are present throughout the film and ultimately distracts attention of audiences away from what should have been something much more special.","true":true}
