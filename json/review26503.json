Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of all the notable deaths in Hollywood this year\\, the Star Wars franchise hit me the hardest.  Au revoir to my beloved movies and characters\\, you've been replaced with shoddy storytelling and terrible new characters (I'm looking at you\\, Rose).\\n\\nRIP Star Wars\\, you will be missed.","true":true}
