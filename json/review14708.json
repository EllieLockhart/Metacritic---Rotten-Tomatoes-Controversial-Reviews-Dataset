Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never reviewed a movie on Rotten Tomatoes before. But after watching this train-wreck at the theaters last night I wanted to tell everyone that this movie is garbage. From the moment Leia force pulls herself from space back onto that ship everything goes downhill from there.... avoid it at all costs. So disappointed in Disney for releasing this tragedy of a movie.","true":true}
