Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a great and very enjoyable movie! Action from start to finish\\, great connection to previous episodes\\, it does have one ridiccccclous scene with Leia\\, but not enough to bash this movie like other fans have. Those fans giving this movie a terrible review is either a hater or blind\\, go see the movie for yourself!","true":true}
