Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst. movie. ever. id rather watch an sjw rant to me about their politcal views than this disnified childing piece of trash that was branded under the star wars name to make a few dollarydoos.","true":true}
