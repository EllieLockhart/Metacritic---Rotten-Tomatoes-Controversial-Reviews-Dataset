Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A waste of my time and money and a huge\\, disrespectful slap in the face to the character of Luke Skywalker. It's so bad. That's just the worst part\\, but the rest of the film is a mess as well. Bad dialogue. Useless subplots. Plot holes and inconsistencies galore. Wasted actors. Truncated action scenes with many cuts. Pointless climax. The space action and Kylo\/Rey relationship were just about the only good things about this film. I can't even consider Disney Star Wars canon anymore. This film was emasculating\\, too. Except for the villains\\, all of the male characters are constantly being put down by the female characters\\, which is a bad thing in and of itself\\, but it also got predictable. Oh\\, and for no reason at all\\, Leia sits out most of the movie. I just can't believe they dropped the ball this badly. It reeks of a cultural programming agenda that they went so far out of their way to assassinate the character of Luke Skywalker this much.
