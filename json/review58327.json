Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Action without excitement. The director has no respect for the characters\\, the franchise\\, or the audience. Luke and most of the island scenes are written mostly as a joke. Characters\\, old and new\\, appear\\, disappear\\, live\\, die randomly\\, without purpose\\, and some without reason\\, just poof\\, gone. The director's sense of humor\\, including toilet jokes and some things that I would not want my kids (or anyone) to see\\, is not to my taste\\, to put it nicely. The director's SOP\\, based on all of his movies\\, is that anything might be true\\, or false\\, or true\\, or false\\, ... Who knows? Well\\, it's just a movie\\, so none of it is real anyway\\, right? The film leaves us essentially where we started\\, albeit without a cliffhanger. And several large portions of the movie are obvious set ups for spin offs and for no other reason. I was heavily invested in the characters from SW7:TFA and I am nothing but disappointed in where they went\\, or rather didn't go\\, because no one went anywhere. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it wasn't as bad as I expected. But I have nothing good to say about it. I hope SW9 is better. But given how many people like SW8\\, I have very low expectations.","true":true}
