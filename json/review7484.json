Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even with great moments and a great Luke\/Rey\/Kylo story\\, the movie drags a subplot so boring that reminded me of the worst parts of the prequels and a bunch of useless characters from both The Force awakens and new ones like Rose or Benicio Del Toro.","true":true}
