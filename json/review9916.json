Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great effects and score\\, but the weakest of all Star Wars films in terms of story telling and character development. A real shame to give a quite unexperienced director and writer full artistic freedom to something like Star Wars.","true":true}
