Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing on so many levels. everything that Force Awakens started was taken away in this film. probably the 3rd or tied for 2nd as far as the worst star wars film (behind episode 1 and 2). no desire to see this movie again in the theaters. i hope that JJ Abrams can once again bring balance to the force.
