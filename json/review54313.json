Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie. Let me state that again: HATED it. Between inexplicable changes in character behavior (and ability)\\, a complete lack of any answers to questions asked in The Force Awakens\\, subplots that go nowhere\\, characters that are introduced only to be sacrificed by the end and plans that 12 year old kids could see the problems with\\, this movie has many\\, MANY problems. (SPOILER ALERT HERE) The most glaring issue for myself is the decision to keep the character of Leia alive\\, whose portrayal in the future will suffer given the actor playing her passed away\\, and to kill off the protagonist of episodes 4\\, 5 and 6\\, Luke Skywalker. They had multiple opportunities (three\\, by my count) to kill off Leia's character with grace and dignity\\, and instead chose to kill off Luke\\, who died astral projecting himself onto another planet\\, thereby ensuring that the character of Rey will not get the training she so desperately needs\\, and denying Luke the warrior's death that he deserved. There are many other issues I have with this film\\, but seeing a childhood hero die like a chump\\, old and faint and alone\\, was the blow that I couldn't take sitting down. I wanted to like this movie. Truly\\, I did. I wanted to laugh in the face of the naysayers. The honest truth is\\, this movie blows.","true":true}
