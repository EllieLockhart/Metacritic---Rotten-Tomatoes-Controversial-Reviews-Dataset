Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so excited for this film. I left feeling very dissapointed and unsatisfied by the decisions of this movie. I feel like Rian Johnson just wanted to undo all the setup and buildup from Force Awakens. This film does nothing to make supreme leader Snoke more than a shitty one dimensional Emperor stand in. Phasma is completely wasted as well. There are so many plotholes and questions that it almost feels like the director was trolling star wars fans that care about the characters and lore of this universe. At least he gave us a 30+ minute horse rescue sequence. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in Episode lX...JJ is gonna have a very hard time trying to salvage this trilogy at this point.","true":true}
