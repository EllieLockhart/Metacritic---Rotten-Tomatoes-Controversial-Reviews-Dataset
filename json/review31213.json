Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes... I wouldn't even know where to begin.\\nI will say the First Order must be a very\\, very dumb organization for someone not to think of just dropping out of lightspeed in front of the rebel ship they were chasing for the majority of the movie.\\nWith all that amazing technology the bad guys have at their disposal\\, I would that they had some smart people within their ranks.  Makes no sense.","true":true}
