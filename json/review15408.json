Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. A few things were out of place\\, and some storylines were what one would call filler\\, but the movie was beautiful\\, well acted and satisfied the part of me that will always love Star Wars. Don't listen to the people giving it 1 star reviews\\, the film has it's issues but overall it's fun and well done. 4\/5","true":true}
