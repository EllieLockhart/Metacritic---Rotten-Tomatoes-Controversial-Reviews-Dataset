Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS MOVIE WAS A TRAIN WRECK. NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED. DISNEY TOOK ONE MOST BELOVED FRANCHISE AND DESTROYED IT. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW DISNEY CAN PUT SO MUCH CARE INTO THE PIXAR AND MARVEL FRANCHISE WHILE JUST RUINING THE STAR WARS FRANCHISE","true":true}
