Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a fantastic sequel to The Force Awakens and great addition to the Star Wars saga. It's unexpected and fresh but pays homage to what came before. I do wish more mysteries were explained but this film was more about creating new questions than answering them. It was an exciting new chapter that leaves open the possibilities for future installments.","true":true}
