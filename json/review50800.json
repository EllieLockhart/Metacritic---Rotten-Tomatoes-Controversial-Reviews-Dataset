Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A better sequel is Jumanji - welcome to the jungle. It was more interesting\\, unpredictable\\, had better acting\\, had better comedy and it left its predecessor alone. \\ndon't waste your time watching the Last Jedi it is garbage.","true":true}
