Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I desperately wanted to like this movie\\, I really did. I loved The Force Awakens despite its lack of originality. I thought it was a fun movie that gave just the right amount of respect to the original cast while introducing us to an engaging cast of new characters. I had high hopes for the future of the franchise until I saw this flaming bag of dog doo. After leaving the theater in shock at the total disrespect of the characters and the source material\\, I took a step back and decided that maybe my initial reaction was too strong. Maybe I needed to give it a second chance and accept that sometimes change is necessary to advance the overall narrative of a story. Unfortunately\\, after a second viewing my aversion to this movie has only deepened. It is painfully obvious to me that the powers that be who created this disaster of a movie sacrificed quality story telling to advance a political agenda(s). They almost smash you in the face with it its so obvious to me now. What a water opportunity\\, thanks for nothing Rian Johnson.","true":true}
