Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where the hell is the Smoke backstory\\, was such a big question on him from TFA. Then he is simply killed by his EMO apprentice. And don't get me started on the most lame excuse of ending for Luke Skywalker. Jedi master and he's killed off without so much as having a force or lightsaber fight. They dropped the ball with this one I'm afraid. Too many plot points\\, is there any point to discussion outcomes and projections for the next movie. Doubt it as they all the questions raised by TFA where nothing in the end.\\n\\nStop directors from writing scripts and direct the movies. Get proper writers and perhaps bring George back to at least give a outline and let proper writers develop the outline into a script.","true":true}
