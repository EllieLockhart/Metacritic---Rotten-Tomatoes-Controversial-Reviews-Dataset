Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible comedy sub plot with rose and Finn just felt like a Mix of Harry potter and some other Disney movie. Didn't feel like a true star wars film in many scenes. The yoda scene was the only scene that brought goosebumps back in a good way. Everything else as far as Luke was just out of character for what true fans know the character is. Hux character  being the main person in charge of an entire fleet is completely undermined by crappy attempts at comedy. I won't say anything as far as Rey parents or snoke death since the story can still change. In general an average everyday viewer can give it 4 out of 5stars because it is a good movie. But true fans or nerds \/ ppl who truly want to believe in the world that is starwars know that they got duped by Disney attempt to capitalize quickly at the expense of story consistency and lure built over 40 years. We all know characters beloved in the originals must die eventually and the shift must turn towards the new characters but not at the expense of the very characters that built the franchise. They deserved better than the ending they received. Fans deserve better. \\n\\n4stars.... great movie for people not invested and \\n2.5 for fans who know what I speak of.","true":true}
