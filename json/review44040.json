Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ did a lot with story devices and themes that TFA didn\u2019t. While our first introduction to the new trilogy relied heavily on old plot devices to carry it forward\\, the sequel showed us what we anticipated but then took the story in a completely different direction. I love that we can only guess where they will go next\\, ","true":true}
