Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent addition to the Star Wars story. For those of us that missed the Skywalker twins\\, it was great to have them back . The new characters are acted with vulnerability and passion. It would take a closed heart to hate this movie.","true":true}
