Therefore\\, you can both say it is a lazy effort by the developers or that they are just loyal and gave good research to those classic horror genre in its golden era. due to this\\, it will be very common for you to feel frustrated to the usual stupid decisions teenagers make in this game. However\\, what really interests me is that you as a player can decide for them in certain aspect of the game\\, and by doing so. You may or may not help them survive until the end. It will not change the general story however\\, it will give you more interactions since more characters will be alive by then. However\\, my main problem is that for a horror game\\, it never was scary for me at all. Yes there are a few jumpscares here and there and creepy places. But after finishing the game i never felt any reluctance to play it again like what games like alien isolation gave to me\\, i couldnt feel any more of this scary moments or pressuring moments. With these\\, a fair score of 6\/10 will do.\r\rGameplay - Gameplay also returned to the days where Resident evil and Silent hills dominates the horror genre with its fixed camera in your exploration. As to the interactivity of the game\\, i can say that it is good despite its lack of quantity esp. those scenes where you should not move since most of them will usually result in your character being put in a bad spot or may jump to their deaths. Another to thing to add that the whole campaign is short but since it is a story driven which changes based on your choices\\, it has a great level of replayability. You can decide to kill them or try to challenge yourself to make them all survive. With this regard\\, a good score of 8\/10 deserves this aspect of the game.\r\rGraphics - As to the environment\\, it is almost perfect. The places are haunting\\, creepy and will really give you the goosebumps in your exploration. As to the character design\\, i liked how the developers really put effort in the motion captures of its characters. Their facial expression are realistic and detailed. However\\, my main problem is the FPS drops that comes more often than not in its cutscenes and due to this\\, delay of sounds or voice sounds occurs which gives me major problems since it is a game where you spend most of the time watching than playing it. Therefore\\, a score of 7\/10 deserves such plus and minus.\r\rMusic and Sound - The music of this game overall is good. The timed sections has that loud music which puts more pressures to you and the haunting ones are properly inserted in those creepy areas which adds to its uneasiness. As to the sound\\, Id say it has its ups and downs\\, as to the ups\\, voice acting of the characters is good and also the sudden sounds that comes in within jumpscare moments are spot on. In fact\\, i had more jumpscares from the sound rather than from the game's visuals. The downs is the same with the cutscenes that sudden framedrops occurs which makes the sound delay and not following the mouth movements of the characters. Considering all the factors i have said. it deserves a score of 7\/10.\r\rAverage score = 6.75 (I dont round off my scores since i dont give perfect scores and zeroes i.e. 9.6 rounded off to 10)\r\rSupermassive games really showed that they have potential to make story driven interactive games. It needs some improvements like its story and also that bad fps and needs more scary moments\\, but overall\\, i was satisfied with the game. I hope they would continue to improve in this aspect and release games in the future that would be in the level of quantic dream games. awesome and hope they live until dawn\\, lol.bad joke i know just kidding.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
