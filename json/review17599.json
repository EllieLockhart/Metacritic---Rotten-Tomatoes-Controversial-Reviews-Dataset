Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is really bad. Like it tries to put jokes that are not funny and ruined the characters. Every single expectiation about the past of some characters is vanished because no one takes the risk to go on a new way. Hated it. Star Wars is dead","true":true}
