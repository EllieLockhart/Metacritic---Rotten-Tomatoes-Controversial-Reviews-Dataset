Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the sequel you've been looking for! I really\\, truly enjoyed this film. Rian Johnson did not have an easy task but he brilliantly wrote and directed a very SMART and unique film. A very different way to explore on screen\\, the story of Luke and Kylo. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver blew me away with their performances. BEAUTIFUL choreography with lightsaber battles\\, gorgeous action sequences\\, easily some of the best you'll ever see. Also some of the best cinematography in a Star Wars film I've ever seen - so many shots made my jaw drop.\\n\\nStructurally this film stands alone as the product of one person\\, without a million hands in the kitchen. The best way I can describe how I felt when I was watching the film: I felt like I was flipping through 2 comic books - Poe Dameron and the main Star Wars story. The rebel storyline\\, and Luke's storyline\\, I loved them both. The storytelling is definitely the standout\\, what this film does for the canon\\, the Star Wars lore as a whole. Especially for those who may not be completely familiar with or up to date with a lot of the canon (comic books\\, novels\\, video games\\, etc.). Conflicted and interesting villains\\, I cared for ALL of the characters\\, not just some\\, They all had something important to do.\\n\\nNow\\, the flaws of the film. I've seen a lot of people criticize the Finn and Rose storyline\\, but I didn't have much issue with it\\, because I was too focused on the unnecessary comedic relief at every turn of the film. Even in critically serious moments. I'm glad there wasn't a lot of Porg because it could have gotten old VERY quickly. Some of the editing was jarring to me\\, the way the film jumps and cuts away from storyline to storyline\\, sometimes in the middle of a crucial scene. And Phasma. The character of Phasma deserves so much better than what we keep getting. Definitely gonna need a second and maybe third viewing of this one!","true":true}
