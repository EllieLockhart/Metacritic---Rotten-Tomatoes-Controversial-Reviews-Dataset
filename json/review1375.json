Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big fan of Star Wars\\, I would say that this is the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. It does have it's problems ( The pointless cantina scene and I found Rose to be irritating )\\, but the great parts are still there. I especially liked how Kylo Ren killed Snoke\\, and to the people who say this is the worst Star Wars movie\\, watch the prequels and Rogue One ( Those deserve to be hated ).","true":true}
