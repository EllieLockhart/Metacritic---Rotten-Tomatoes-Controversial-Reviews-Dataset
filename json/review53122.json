Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very bleak storyline with tremendous plot holes painted over with a generous budget of visual effects and flashy scenes. This film took all the audience was looking forward to from Episode VII and threw it into the trash\\, the correlation between the two films is so meaningless it's hard to believe the same studio was responsible for both. Mark's performance as Luke was annoying to watch as the 'veteran master' came off as whiny and annoying. The character of Snoke is worth nothing after this film\\, and the character of Rey's parents mean nothing after this film.. why would J.J create such curiosity in The Force Awakens to let Rian Johnson trample this franchise with such a shallow film to follow it. Incredibly disappointed.","true":true}
