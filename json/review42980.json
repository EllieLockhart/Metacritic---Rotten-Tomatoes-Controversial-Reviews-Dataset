{"101487":187089,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is an excellent case study on why subverting expectations at every possible turn\\, without stopping to consider what the impact of that might be\\, makes for an awful movie.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens had its problems (and an unkind interpretation of the film would simply brand it as \\\"A New Hope 2\\\")\\, but what it did manage to do was lay interesting groundwork for a new trilogy of Star Wars films.  Rian Johnson\\, instead of exploring any of the interesting story threads that were introduced in Episode 7\\, chose to completely ignore everything that had happened in the previous film (to such an extent that it felt deliberately malicious). \\n\\nThis movie just feels like the type of Star Wars film that someone who actively dislikes Star Wars would make.  Old characters seem like complete strangers in their behavior and views.  The villain is killed off unceremoniously in the middle of the film.  Both new and old characters are given deus ex machina force abilities whenever the plot calls for it (which would have probably been fine if we were given some sort of indication that any meaningful training or development was happening for them).  \\n\\nAlmost every decision made for this movie lowers the stakes and leaves the audience less invested.  It is bad enough for this film on its own\\, but when you consider that this is supposed to be the second film in a trilogy\\, you start to wonder who allowed any of these choices to be made.  \\n\\nThe big\\, bad\\, evil guy?  Killed off in the middle of the film.  There's no one to replace him\\, by the way - Kylo isn't strong enough of an antagonist at the end of this film to stand in as the Big Evil.  There are no other candidates.  JJ had to bring back an old character to fill the void (which I have no qualms with).  \\n\\nThe epic climax that was foreshadowed earlier in the film?  Ruined with out-of-place attempts at humor (most of the humor in this film felt somewhat out of place).  Even if we forgive that\\, all of the tension and excitement that was built up for this part of the film is INSTANTLY dissipated when we find out that Luke ISN'T ACTUALLY THERE.  It felt like Johnson thought this would be a cool reveal\\, but instead it retroactively made everything that just happened feel completely hollow.  And then\\, for seemingly no reason at all (\\\"extreme exertion\\,\\\" I suppose)\\, Luke dies.  Just like that.  He didn't even do anything.  He never left his self-imposed exile.\\n\\nThe entire casino planet events were uninteresting\\, and ultimately pointless.  Had no one gone to the casino planet\\, nothing would have changed.  \\n\\nHyperspace rules were rewritten (another deus ex machina) in the middle of the film.  Honestly\\, the visuals of this scene were stunning.  It also introduced major plot holes for every other Star Wars film.  \\n\\nHonestly\\, even if we pretend this wasn't a Star Wars film\\, the movie was awful.  Characters make arbitrarily stupid decisions (that aren't particularly in character)\\, the humor mostly misses\\, the plot is arbitrary and uninteresting\\, and the new characters are boring and unchanged throughout the film.  There is hardly anything redeeming about this\\, besides the visuals.  \\n\\nI genuinely left the theater upset after having seen this film.  It is hard to imagine it being worse than what it ended up being.  It is INSANE to me that the so-called critics have given this film a favorable score.","true":true}
