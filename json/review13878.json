Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you always wanted to see Luke Skywalker be a wimp\\, Lea inexplicably become Superwoman\\, and a rebel commander chastise a fighter pilot for losing a few bombers so she can sacrifice the entire rebel fleet before finally fighting back then this movie is for you.  If not I can sum it up the new Star Wars for you in one sentence. Men are weak and out of control and the universe would be better off without them.","true":true}
