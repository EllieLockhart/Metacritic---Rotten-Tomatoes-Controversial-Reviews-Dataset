Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two years after The Force Awakens rocked the sleeping giant to life\\, and left audiences with so many questions and so few answers\\, the franchise fell into the lap of Rian Johnson. As a director known to not be afraid to take risks\\, this second installment in the new trilogy proves his pedigree.\\n\\nThis is a daring\\, emotional\\, nuanced entry in the saga that rises to the levels of its greatest forebears\\, bringing drama and action at high levels throughout. Surprise after surprise litters the landscape\\, as every time you think you can breathe\\, something else happens to bash you back into the thick of the story.\\n\\nThe new Big Three of Star Wars bring their A game from the outset\\, and as the film progresses\\, it is easy to see which one falls into the role of Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia from the original trilogy.\\n\\nOn the subject of Leia\\, watching Carrie Fisher's final performance is an emotional journey. Those of us who have been with her since A New Hope will doubtlessly feel a greater connection to her character\\, and an emotional tug each time she is on screen. This should not distract from how good she is even without that caveat. She is as always a pleasure to watch\\, and it is truly sad that there will be no further films from her. As for her on-screen brother\\, Mark Hamill remains terrific in anything he is in\\, and plays Luke in a way that he never has before\\, elevating the character to further legendary levels.\\n\\nThis film has met and surpassed any expectations\\, bringing the great Star Wars formula to new heights; fun\\, action\\, weird new creatures and beautiful new worlds\\, humor\\, and dramatic girth. it is eminently quotable\\, a visual feast\\, and a satisfying experience.","true":true}
