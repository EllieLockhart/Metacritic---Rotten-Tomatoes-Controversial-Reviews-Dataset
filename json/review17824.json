Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It gets stars for the special effects and camera work\\, everything else is either disjointed\\, broken\\, poorly conceived\\, terribly executed and with regards to the brand itself\\, spits in the eye of fan anticipation\\, as if hype for the movie was a bad thing.","true":true}
