Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving this a one Star. And the only reason it's getting one Star is because the visuals and fight scenes were well done. Other than that the movie was garbage. They tried to hard to put humor in where it didn't belong. An example is the opening scene with Poe and Hux. Then onto my next point...... The rest of the movie they completely ripped off empire strikes back and return of the Jedi and crammed it into one movie.  From the rebels fleeing the imperial fleet (millenium falcon running in the asteroids) to the assault on crait (hoth) to Rey and Kylo confronting snoke (Luke and Vader on the Death star). Then the way they scripted Luke was terrible. This could've been the movie to save the trilogy from the Force Awakens completely ripping off A New Hope but they just completely ripped off the other two.","true":true}
