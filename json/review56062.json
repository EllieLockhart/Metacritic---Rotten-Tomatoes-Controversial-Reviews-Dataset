Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many dropped subplots from Episode 7. It feels like Rian read the wikipedia page as research when he was writing the story for this movie. Snoke is pretty much a joke and gives no answers as to his character. Phasma's character is once again tossed aside like trash. \\n\\nThere is NO progression of the story at all. How the last movie ends\\, is exactly how this one ends. No one changes sides\\, no one side gains an advantage. Zero progression.","true":true}
