Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was ok\\, too much of a comedy\\, not enough reverence to the mystery and mysticism of Star Wars. It felt jumbled\\, action filled\\, but not a lot of plot development. \\n\\nHate to say it...wish Lucas did these\\, but as a producer. JJverse failed Star Trek\\, now its failing Star Wars. He might be the biggest destroyer since Micheal Bay.","true":true}
