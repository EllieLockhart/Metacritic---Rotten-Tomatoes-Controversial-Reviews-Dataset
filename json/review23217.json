Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. I don't get the complainers from TFA thought it was a remake of ANH. Now complainers are upset that this one is different. I am huge fan. I loved the original trilogy. I still liked the prequels. And I love the new films. Can'twait to see episode IX.","true":true}
