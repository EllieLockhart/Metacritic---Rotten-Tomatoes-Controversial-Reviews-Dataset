Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great! It mirrors the originals while also bringing in new thoughts and ideas. You have to understand that people\\, even your most beloved heroes\\, change after 40 yrs. here they are fighting the same battle again and there needs to be a real change in order to win for good. Like the old saying if you fail to learn from history  you are doomed to repeat it. In this universe\\, in this film\\, they are finally learning that lesson.... the hard way. Give the movie a chance   Open your mind and let your feelings go and you will actually enjoy it","true":true}
