Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film with many twists\\, and John Williams's score soars in this film. When I first watched Episode VII my reaction was mixed. This film blew me away. The music is much more to the level of the older films (1-6) while 7 was more subtle and I missed the music that has thankfully returned for this installment. Honestly\\, the film deserves a higher audience score.","true":true}
