Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My only problem with the movie was what felt like a pacing issue in the first act of the film. Fast pace didn\u2019t help when it came to establishing character moments an environments. But other then that an one or two CGI shots in the movie\\, thought it was fantastic an can\u2019t wait to see it again! ","true":true}
