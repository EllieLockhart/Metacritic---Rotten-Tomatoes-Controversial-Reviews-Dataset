Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not bad\\, but for a finale of a saga we could call it below average. At some point it feels like watching a compilation of scenes which were inspired by the Matrix\\, Inception and even Jurassic World (If you listen carefully you can recognize the score of JW during the Dino-look-a-like running scene) . The writers must have thought we need to put EVERYTHING in this movie to make it work. Although the special effects are good and the actors not bad\\, it never becomes a grand finale as a whole. They had the tools\\, but they didn't know how to use them\\, which is a bit strange considering the decades that Star wars has been on the table. Expiration date overdue? Maybe. In any case it's a tribute to the late great Carrie Fischer. They unconsciously referred to her passing away\\, it's like they felt it. Luke Skywalker on a mountaintop\\, beautiful scenery and that's the end of Star wars. Please don't make another one.@Korben_Dallas on Twitter","true":true}
