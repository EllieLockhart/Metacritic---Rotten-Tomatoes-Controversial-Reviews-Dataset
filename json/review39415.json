Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is so incoherent and disjointed that I'd need a second viewing to even remotely understand what the heck is going on and why.  But I'm not a sadist\\, so that's just not going to happen. How you go from TFA and Rogue One to this is beyond me.  Kathleen Kennedy needs to step down and let someone else take the reigns\\, and Rain Johnson should never be allowed to even watch another Star Wars film\\, let alone direct one.  Actually\\, he can keep watching this train wreck over and over\\, since he was the engineer steering it off the rails.","true":true}
