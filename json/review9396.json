Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Glad I saw it\\, but very glad I only paid ITunes $5.99 to rent.  Near-unwatchable snooze fest\\, save for the final 30 minutes or so.  What they did to Luke Skywalker's character would approximate revealing George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as Al Qaida sympathizers.  But\\, I'm glad to learn the name is actually Kylo Ren.  All this time I thought it was Ky Lauren\\, great-great-great-great grandfather of Ralph Lauren.  THAT would have made a better plot twist than the ones in this flaming x-wing fighter wreck of a movie.","true":true}
