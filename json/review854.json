Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An extremely disappointing middle chapter in the new Star Wars trilogy. The plot was boring and nonsensical\\, and felt obligatory at parts such as the final battle scene. New characters were unnecessary and only served to distract from what could have been a truly epic return for Luke Skywalker and a passing of the mantle to a younger generation of heroes. The Last Jedi sets an uneven\\, confusing emotional tone that reaches ridiculous levels at times. Despite the movie constantly needing to remind you that the rebels are at their lowest point and to hope\\, hope\\, hope\\, hope\\, hope\\, the unnecessary humor and shenanigans actively work against this dark\\, emotional attitude. Fans expecting a dark middle chapter for our heroes to overcome against all odds in the final installment\\, full of bombshell revelations and exciting fights against powerful foes\\, will be sorely disappointed. Despite multiple opportunities during the plot in which to redeem itself\\, the movie instead doubled-down on predictable\\, obligatory outcomes and never came close to living up to the excitement and promise generated by the trailers. All this being said\\, I do see the possibility of an important foundation being laid in this movie that could culminate into at least one major bombshell in the final movie. I'll hope\\, hope\\, hope\\, hope\\, hope that was intentional and that Disney hasn't completely missed the mark\\, but only time will tell.","true":true}
