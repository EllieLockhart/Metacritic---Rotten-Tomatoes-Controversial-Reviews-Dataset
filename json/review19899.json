Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was different than I was expecting. Almost nothing went the way I thought. After seeing it\\, I felt a little dissapointed. The second time I saw it\\, I liked it much better. I feel like Rian Johnson should have done more to answer questions the we had after VII. I think he focused more on making the movie he wanted to make\\, and not the movie the audience wanted. I liked the plot twists\\, and the new character development\\, but I did not like anything with Rose. I feel like her character was used in the wrong way\\, and Benicio del Toro's character was underused. There were plenty of moments not to like\\, but plenty of moments to love too. Overall\\, it's pretty good. I would tell anyone who didn't like it\\, to see it a second time. It really changed my perspective on the movie.","true":true}
