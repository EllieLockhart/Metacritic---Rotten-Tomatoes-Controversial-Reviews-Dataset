{"101487":118476,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VIII was disappointing\\, but not ok.\\n\\nComplaints: \\n1. Poe's choices were repeatedly stupid\\, and caused repeated loss of life and ships\\, both of which were in short supply for the rebellion. He didn't seem to feel remorse or to learn. Holdo saying she liked him as she stayed behind to die (and cut a Star Destroyer in half) gave a bizarre pass to him. She assumed her plan was still in place\\, but it was still pointless. She was right\\, he was wrong\\, there was no need to have her approve him.  \\n\\n2. Finn and Rose's related subplot was pointless and broke the cardinal rule of \\\"show\\, don't tell\\,\\\" in the heavyhanded attempt to create a character for Rose and some commentary on how the galaxy worked. They continue this with her implying she's in love with Finn and kissing him (it's been what\\, 24 hrs since they met? Crush\\, yes; love\\, no) with an overly dramatic set of lines for her near death. I guess they needed something to do with Finn... but it felt really contrived and they might as well have had the First Order just capture them after leaving the Rebel ship\\, before going down to Space-Monte Carlo. That said\\, having an elaborate plot that fails is at least a good idea\\, upsetting the classic narrative\\, darker middle episode in a trilogy\\, etc. It just wasn't done well.\\n\\n3. Snoke's disco robe and presence were weird. Snokes reveal didn't have the nothing-but-power-matters\\, stark feel of the confrontation with emperor palpatine in VI\\, but also wasn't so luxurious that we got a different (or any) sense of Snoke's motivations. \\n\\n4. Leia's flying scene was odd. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Yes\\, she could and probably would have been developing her own connection with the force over the years between VI and now\\, but having seen nothing of her ability VII or VIII\\, the idea that she can \\\"wake-up\\\" from vacuum is... odd\\, at best. I love Leia and Carrie Fisher\\, but... \\n\\nPraise:\\n1. The main characters continue to have great chemistry and draw you in. \\nA. Rey and Kylo were very cool the whole time. Interesting that she left him alive\\, despite presumably being able to kill him when he was unconscious. Maybe just a vehicle to end the fight with both of them alive and Hux not knowing Kylo killed Snokes though. \\n\\nB. Rey and Luke confrontation was great\\, fills in what happened with Kylo.\\n\\nC. Luke and Kylo confrontation was great. If he'd survived it physically it would have been too over the top in comparison to what we saw Obiwan or Yoda do\\, the projection angle was much better. \\n\\nD. Rey and Finn reuniting was moving\\, as always.\\n\\n2. Luke's issues were interesting\\, and not entirely expected so\\, cool.\\n\\n3. Rey's parentage is best this way; it would have been contrived and stupid to have made her Obiwan's daughter\\, niece\\, whatever. This whole story starts with Anakin; a nobody. Perfectly good to have it continue with another nobody-at-birth.\\n\\n4. Kylo's development was great. Having him unable to kill Leia\\, general brokenness\\, etc. was believable and made the Snokes confrontation more interesting. As soon as he kills Snokes we know he isn't really going to turn back to the light side\\, because we'd be left with Hux as our main villian and that's too weak\\, but it was still and great scene.\\n\\n5. Similarly\\, good not to have Rey seem to flirt with the dark side really\\, it just wouldn't have been believable for her character. The interactions with Kylo are interesting\\, but we can tell she isn't drawn to joining him\\, only to saving him. \\n\\nI could go on\\, but this is already more than anyone will ever read!","true":true}
