Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rogue One a solid 8\\, The Force Awakens a solid 8.3\\, The Last Jedi a respectable 7.7. But this is why I hate mixing directors in a series. The Force Awakens was great in keeping it star wars but also kept it intense when it needed to be\\, but funny and witty when it needed to be\\, along with a great plot. The Last Jedi is the longest star wars movie and for that this is where it lacks. It seemed like a little drawn out plot with scenes that also seemed drawn out and failed to keep the intensity at good points and tried to be a lot more fun and witty when it wasnt neccessary\\, then at the ending it makes you think where the heck they are going to take this series. So hopefully the next one kinda places this one better then what it is now. Neverthless its still star wars\\, not the best but also not the worst\\, its just good. Still recommened watching;)","true":true}
