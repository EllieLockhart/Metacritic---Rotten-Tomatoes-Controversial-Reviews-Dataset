Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this one one while star just for the fact that it is a Star Wars movie and it had Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill.  I get that Directors want to put their own stamp on a franchise and think it is an accomplishment to go in a different direction. But this move did not feel like a Star Wars movie. Characterization\\, plot\\, and pacing were all off.  Such a disappointment and what a horrible way to treat a cinematic legacy.","true":true}
