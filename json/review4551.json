Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cingy at best\\, here's The Bad & Good\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- Inconsistent\\, even within the new franchise. Somehow\\, mid-franchise the director forgets the end of the last movie\\, having the rebels on the run instead of the offensive. Also\\, why would Luke make a map if he didn't want to be found\/help?\\n- Additional secondary characters and locations that have no point  beyond time wasting dramatic filler. Rose\\, Admiral Pink Hair\\, Casino Planet. Though the acting coming from these characters was somewhat of a redeeming factor.\\n- Corny and at times creepy jokes. Luke milking a space walrus?!\\n\\nThe Good:\\n- On all accounts the acting was good.\\n- The visuals & design were amazing.\\n- Luke no longer has to live on an Island full of goofy fish people and odd daily milking rituals\\n\\nIn summary\\, this movie is full of cringe and I believe a culmination of both a new director and the disney-fication of the franchise to the fullest.","true":true}
