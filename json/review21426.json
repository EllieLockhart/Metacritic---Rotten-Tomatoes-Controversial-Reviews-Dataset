Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wonder how much Disney is paying all these top-tier critics to endorse this disaster. It has been 24 hours since I saw this disappointment and its audience approval rating has been steadily dropping. It now has the official lowest audience score in the entire Star Wars franchise. It is a bloated\\, meandering mess that is rank with poorly written characters\\, cheap\/hollow one-liner jokes that are the staple of superhero movies\\, contradictions in the well-established characters\\, cheesy moments that cause viewers to cringe\\, characters the audiences actually care about are underutilized\\, extended and gratuitous scenes that obviously geared to entertain small children\\, an overabundance of CGI\\, and a plot that rushes where it needs to be paced and slogs down where we need speed. Kylo Ren and Rey are the two standouts of the film that are actually watchable. It pains me to see this franchise become the trainwreck it is\\, and I am not the kind of Star Wars fan who nitpicks everything but I have actually lost all respect for Disney and the Star Wars franchise. I will no longer be attending new movies and will content myself with everything pre-Last Jedi.","true":true}
