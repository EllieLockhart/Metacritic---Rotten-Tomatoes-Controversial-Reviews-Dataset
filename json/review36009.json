Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi Review\\n\\nWelcome to the end of Star Wars. This movie turned Luke into a hateful coward that gets beat by Rey in a duel if you can call it that and dies making a hologram of himself\\, dying alone!\\nRey is a nobody with no training that can beat Luke into submission\\, yet again whip Kylo with no lightsaber training all of one reason: her gender.\\nThis movie pushes hate for men to a new level fromthe slap Poe gets\\, to Finn being robbed of a courageous act and Luke the hero of the Rebellion and a Jedi Master being so out of character he would try to murder his nephew! \\nMen are idiots\\, cowards and retarded in this movie like we see from Kylo's tantrums and Hux's idiocy throughout the movie.\\nAdmiral Holdo with her purple hair is an SJW straight out of an Antifa March hating all men\\, putting people in needless danger. Leia who never became a Jedi is somehow able to fly through space faster than Mary Poppins! \\nRey has no character development or arc just scene after scene showing how she's perfect\\, knows everything about the force needing no training showing up Luke again and again.\\nIf you want a feminist SJW wet dream here you go...have fun watching Luke be a total loser milking a space cow. May the Force have mercy on your soul!","true":true}
