Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was literally shocking how afoul this movie went. A classic case of subverting expectations\\, not in order to make a better story or set up a bigger payoff\\, but just for the sake of being different. I am all for taking chances\\, but it seems like the writer\/director Rian Johnson simply didn't respect the characters. It was arrogant and self aware the entire movie. I would give it 1 stars if it weren't so pretty at times.","true":true}
