{"101487":145791,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a huge Star Wars fan for basically my entire life. In anticipation for TFA\\, I had the official poster hanging in my room\\, and on another note\\, I actually enjoyed the final act of Rouge One. That being said\\, The Last Jedi had far too many holes\\, flat characters\\, and scenes that simply made no sense\\, for me to enjoy the uncharacteristically long two-and-a-half hours I sat in the theater. To name a few moments I despised: \\n\\n(1. Rose's character arc was the hardest for me to stomach. It seemed incredibly forced. They continue the theme of having a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" character in this film\\, as Rose goes from working at the bottom of the food chain aboard a Resistance ship to becoming an adept pilot in less than a few days. I won't even get into that whole speeder scene with Finn and Rose\\, and Rose's two day long excursion with Finn that ended with a confession of love. (why?) Suffice it to say that this arc is in contention for my least favorite in all of Star Wars.\\n\\n(2. As a fan\\, I really don't like the direction they took Luke in this series\\, (either does Mark Hammil\\, btw.) Luke is a husk of what he was in the OT. In this movie he nearly kills one of his students\\, refuses to help save the galaxy because he needs to live a meaningless existence until he dies\\, and lives as a hermit on some island catching fish and drinking the raw milk of some space walrus. I don't think I'm alone in being dissatisfied with that.\\n\\nThis film really plays with your expectations\\, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; However\\, Snoke getting no substantive scenes and then being sliced in half in the most predictable \\\"apprentice turns on his master scene\\\" in history (ripped directly from Jedi\\, btw) or Luke throwing his lightsaber over his shoulder to cap that \\\". . .literal cliff hanger. He's on a cliff! Did you get that visual pun?\\\" (Hamill\\, 2017) was immensely unsatisfying.\\n \\nTL;DR This is the second of three movies in the trilogy\\, so maybe the last movie will actually have a powerful story and meaningful characters. I doubt it\\, but maybe. At least there's that Solo movie to look forward too. . . yippee.\\n\\nOverall\\, this film has almost singlehandedly evaporated my drive to see franchise movies in theater\\, and I wouldn't hesitate to think that other movie-goers feel the same.","true":true}
