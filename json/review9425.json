Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Goddamn... I brought my dad who is a big Star Wars fan like myself. I was embarrassed I even brought him along for this dumpster fire. \\n\\nThe whole side story with Tico and freeing the animals was long and boring as hell... Purple hair chick was unlikable from the start and we're meant to feel sorry for her after her death? \\n\\nLuke... Luke! Don't get me started... Ruin Johnson puked on this gem of a character. \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to\\\" and that's exactly what roundheaded J did. \\n\\nTo think he's getting his own trilogy after this? Man\\, it's almost like companies these days do not want money anymore. Fair enough. \\n\\nJar Jar standalone would have sold more than the Last (nail in the coffin) Jedi.","true":true}
