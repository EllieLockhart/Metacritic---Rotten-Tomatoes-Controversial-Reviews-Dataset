Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful visuals are not enough to redeem Rian Johnson's self indulgent take on the Star Wars universe.  Plot holes\\, pointless subplots\\, and a profane treatment of the source material make this a pointless waste of time and money.   I understand Disney's desire to \\\"let the past go\\\"\\, but there was no need to drag it through the dirt on it's way out.  If you expect your movie to make a billion dollars\\, you should be able to afford a decent writer\/director.","true":true}
