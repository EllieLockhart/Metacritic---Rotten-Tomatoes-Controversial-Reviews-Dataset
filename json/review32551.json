Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi feels forced\\, unoriginal\\, overproduced\\, and unmemorable. This is Star Wars...not some Michael Bay film. This is a cheesy\\, random Disney movie that wastes the time\\, money\\, intellect\\, and imagination of an extremely dedicated and intelligent fan base on something wholly unmemorable. I was honestly waiting for Jar Jar Binks to grace us with a cameo. Star Wars fans are smarter than this\\, expect more\\, and deserve more. Do better.","true":true}
