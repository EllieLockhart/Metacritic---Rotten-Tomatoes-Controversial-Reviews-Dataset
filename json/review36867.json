Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a monstricity\\, I dont know why Rian Johnson did what he did... and why critcs are talking so 'good' about this movie\\, they are definitely paid off.. Sure as a sci-fi movie it's an 'ok' movie.. but as a star wars movie\\, it's very confusing\\, the movie is all over the place\\, I felt like I was watching 3 stories mixed up into 1 movie.... The skywalker legacy has been thrown away like garbage.... the character development of Rey and Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) also wasn't in the movie at all.. Rey getting 3 tiny lessons and becomes powerful.. or as luke said 'I've only seen this raw strength once in my life' ... The side quest Finn & Rose had\\, was very unnessacery\\, if they left that part away\\, it wouldn't make the movie any better though\\, but at least it would've saved me some time... halve way through the movie\\, I almost fell a sleep\\, it just couldn't make it interesting for me... one positive thing though\\, the visuals.. and the 'action' was pretty cool.. But next to all the clich\u00e9 stuff though... it's so lame\\, so predictable.. they might talk so 'good' about this movie.. but I dont see it... the choices that were made were wrong\\, and I dont see how this movie got praised so much.. it's a true shame that this movie is called 'star wars' JJ abrams has a huge thing to do with the number IX\\, but I do believe a lot of people have lost interest already in this franchise\\, some might call it 'bold' decisions Rian made\\, but I acan't stand behind them.. it's unfortunate to see the classic characters fade away like this.. especially Luke... Though Leia was the worst of all\\, how she can blown up and then flew back to the ship\\, was just out of character and to a point so disney-ish and hilarious\\, I laughed out loud when I saw they did that... after 30 years she felt the force and flew back to the ship? give me a break... Luke perhaps couild've done it\\, even though I would even find that weird. \\n\\nAnd how they killed off Snoke is the worst though.. how easily he managed Rey when she tried to attack him\\, and he didn't even felt a single disturbance in the force regarding Kylo Ren trying to cut him in halve with a damn lightsaber... he was soo powerful\\, and we didn't even see him in action\\, yes force choking Rey but that's about it... it's so awkward and strange..\\nA thing I wanna address\\, Admiral Ackbar though\\, if they wanted him to die like almost all classic characters\\, so they can make room for a new generation\\, at least they should've made him go out in a bang\\, and not just being exploded together with Leia... they should've let him suicide for the Rebellion or anything like that.. but obviously that didn't happen or else I wouldn't be typing this.\\n\\nAnyways\\, I can't and won't type forever\\, I'm just very let down by this movie\\,  I wanted it so much to be an amazing and thrilling experience... \\n\\nI won't forgive Disney and Rian for what they did to Luke\\, and General Akbar...\\n\\nI can only rate this movie with an 1\/10 \\, I would've loved to give it an 8\/10 since I like the star wars movies.. im not an hardcore or anything\\, I just enjoy it.","true":true}
