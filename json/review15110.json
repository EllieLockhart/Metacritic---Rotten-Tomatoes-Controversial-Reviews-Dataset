Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked a New Hope. tHIS ONE WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. tHE STORY WAS NOT UP TO PAR. tHE MOST BELOVED CHARACTERS WERE KILLED OFF. tHE ONE BLACK MALE STAR WHO WAS GOING TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF TO SAVE EVERYONE HAD HIS HEROISM TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM. tHE ONLY SATISFYING PART OF THE MOVIE WAS THE LIGHTSABER BATTLE AFTER THE KILLING OF sNOKE. Disney IS BECOMING CANCER WITH THE OVERLOADING THEIR MEDIA WITH IDENTITY POLITICS.","true":true}
