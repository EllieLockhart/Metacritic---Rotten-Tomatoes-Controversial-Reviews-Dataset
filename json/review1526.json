Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan\\, I was levetating in my seat as that iconic opening crawl appeared on the screen. Sad to say it but by the time this movie ended i discovered that it was one of only a small handful of high points for me in the film. Aside from the numerous plot holes\\, weak character development\\, misplaced humor and bloated screenplay\\, it was perhaps the treatment of Luke Skywalker that I found the most distasteful. I witnessed a true icon of the franchise reduced to shambles\\, only to be reinspired and then subsequently killed off at the very moment when he was just approaching redemption and greatness. In short\\, if feel that Luke\\, the saga and the fans deserved better.","true":true}
