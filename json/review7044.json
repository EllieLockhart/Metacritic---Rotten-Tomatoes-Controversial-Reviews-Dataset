{"101487":117781,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Edit: I've since dropped my review to half a star. As good as the movie looks\\, they wasted Mark Hamill's time and that should be punished.\\n\\nI've already seen it and can guarantee that I wont be rewatching this one. Doesn't have the same rewatch value as The Force Awakens (TFA) and that movie i've only watched twice since it's release to DVD and Digital (I regret purchasing it on Google Play when it released).\\n\\nWarning: This review is spoiler-heavy. Proceed at your own risk if you haven't yet viewed it.\\n\\nAs a movie\\, this rating should be at about 0.5 - 1 because it completely takes a dump on everything the Original Trilogy (and to some extent the Prequels) set up. While TFA introduced the fact that the ending of Return of the Jedi meant nothing of consequence because the Rebels and the Empire are still around with the same power dynamics (pretty much)\\, this movie further solidifies that nothing that came before it matters. \\n\\nThe way this movie is presented to the audience is different. Disney has transitioned Star Wars from a semi-serious nerdy franchise to more of a tween\/YA novel demographic. It's got gags\\, it's silly\\, it's not as serious. All the while\\, though\\, the movie tries to have gravity by killing of fan-favorite Admiral Ackbar in a blink and you miss it scene and killing off Luke after hyping everyone up for his return after the ending of TFA.\\n\\nLuke's scene at the end of TFA is essentially the start of a strip-tease and The Last Jedi is a continuation of that strip-tease with absolutely no payoff. His role in the movie starts with him taking Anakin's lightsaber from Rey and casually throwing it behind him like a can of soda or litter... His father's lightsaber\\, the lightsaber he first used\\, the lightsaber he lost his hand with in his first lightsaber duel with his father the moment he learned his true heritage\\, the first lightsaber ever seen on screen is tossed aside with little thought. It seemed to me\\, a metaphor for Disney throwing away what came before in favor of new-ness they can completely control and tailor to the focus-group formulas\\, and this scene should set your expectations for this movie.\\n\\nFollowing that\\, another event that was terribly done was Snoke's backstory\\, or rather lack thereof. Snoke's character amounts to little more than a bait-and-switch and is killed perhaps just past the midpoint of the movie. He narrates his own death foolishly\\, and I've seen some people calling it poetic but I think it's lazy. We get no back story for the character that was often described as \\\"more powerful than Palpatine\\\" and \\\"ancient\\\" and then he is killed. How they could have made it better is by NOT showing Kylo moving the lightsaber next to Snoke with the Force. The audience isn't stupid\\, we would be able to piece together that betrayal and it would make it more shocking. No need to telegraph what is happening to the audience.\\n\\nAnother inane part of the movie: We learn Rey's backstory. She is a nobody from Jakku\\, her parents sold her for drinking money and\\, if I remember correctly\\, they are said to be dead. So for the last two years hundreds of YouTube channels\\, blogs and articles and thousands upon thousands of fans\\, new and old alike\\, have been speculating about the two biggest mysteries of the new Star Wars films\\, Rey and Snoke\\, only to have the rug pulled out from under them in pretty weak reveals that Rey is a nobody and Snoke is also\\, a nobody.\\n\\nIn the last movie\\, Disney broke the Force as we knew it by having Rey completely know how to use random Force powers as the plot demanded such as Jedi mind trick and Kylo Ren's mind reading trick (and for those that defended this as maybe she was one of Luke's students\\, The Last Jedi all but confirms she is literally just a nobody who never had any sort of training in her youth). In this movie\\, the Force is broken with one scene: SuperLeia.\\n\\nGen. Leia's ship's bridge is blown to smithereens by TIE fighters. This is what kills Admiral Ackbar in the background and Leia is flung into the cold embrace of space. This honestly would have been a good death for the character. It respects her as a frontline fighter\\, general and leader to the end willing to sacrifice her life for her cause just as quickly as anyone else. But\\, nope! Instead we get a terrible scene of her FLYING back to the ruined bridge. You see her body freezing in space and her skin breaking down. You essentially see her die\\, then her hand twitches and moves and then she shoots back to the destroyed bridge and lands at the door in a strangely beautiful yet disgusting display of CG. Resistance members take her in and make no question of what just happened or how she survived and the movie moves on like it did not just violate physics by even Star Wars' logic. This is\\, to me\\, Star Wars jumping the shark.\\n\\nThis movie also has the pointless character of BB-9E\\, affectionately named BB-H8 by fans. This is that black version of BB-8 that was all over marketing. There was a $150 sphero of BB-9E and various commercials featured the droid. In the movie it's there for about 30 seconds and then that's it. But\\, hey\\, the company got your $150\\, so that's something.\\n\\nIf you haven't noticed the lack of Finn\\, Poe and Rose in this review\\, then you're doing fine. Everything they do is pretty lackluster. The opening with Poe is alright but quickly becomes a bore as Poe survives improbable situation after improbable situation and a minor character\\, Paige\\, dies. This throws Rose\\, her less interesting sister\\, into the limelight of being a hero with Finn for wacky adventures on a planet that is like a strange PETA commercial (don't hurt animals\\, m'kay?) and then there's also a slight reveal that rich people are profiting from the war and \\\"rich people are evil\\, 'mkay?\\\" (Which is real rich coming from Disney\\, pardon the pun). The whole subplot here felt very awkward and forced. \\n\\nStar Wars never had a political message originally. There were politics in the world\\, yes\\, but they didn't really stand out as being direct representation of current events. I don't watch Star Wars to get generic Disney messages shoved down my throat\\, I watch to take a break from reality.\\n\\nProbably the biggest spoiler is that Luke goes out like a punk. He does very little other than play the unwilling and hard-headed mentor. The movie depicts him as a crotchety old man who was willing to murder a child (Ben) because of the potential evil in the child (I guess child-murder runs in the family). \\nWhen he finally gets his will to fight and you think that he will be the bamf we expect him to be\\, it turns out he couldn't even bother to show up. For the whole movie\\, he does not leave the island. The climax of this movie is him dodging Kylo's attacks as a projection (so he has no reason to dodge since he isn't there) then he dies of exhaustion. It's an underwhelming 1-2 minutes or so. His death scene is honestly really well shot with the sunsets but it's so undeserved. Fans have been waiting since 1980s\\, over 30 years to see Luke again on the big screen and there's a certain expectation for what Luke should be able to do\\, especially after Disney torched Legends canon in favor of their NEU. For Luke to go out like this means we will (probably) never see Mark Hamill go all out. What was shown here was not even a fraction of how powerful he was in Legends before Disney or even in the comics since Disney. Because he fades away\\, Disney easily has an out to say \\\"Oh\\, we didn't actually kill him!\\\" But i feel that would only happen if there was sufficient fan backlash (which there wont be due to brand dilution of Star Wars).\\n\\nThis is probably the first Star Wars episodic movie that does not have a lightsaber fight. Instead we get an admittedly cool scene of Rey and Kylo fighting the red shirts\\, er\\, red guards side by side after Kylo kills Snoke. It's choreographed well and it's one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie\\, but it is quickly ruined at the end with Kylo trying ot get Rey to join him\\, for some reason. Why does everyone want Rey on their team? Because she's the most powerful I guess. When Darth Vader asked Luke to join him\\, it wasn't because Luke was amazing\\, it was because they were father and son. There was a bond there and Vader wanted someone to hold on to. It's nice even for the Lord of the Sith to feel happiness and love again and he wanted Luke because Luke was all Vader had left of Padme\\, the one reason he went to the Dark Side. Here\\, Kylo has no connection to Rey other than she's Rey. He even explicitly says that she's nobody.\\n\\nChewbacca gets side-lined (again) and is paired up for comedy with the money-draining porgs: the furbies of Star Wars. They aren't that bad in the movie but you still wish they weren't there\\, and when Chewie almost eats one\\, I found myself rooting for him to do it. Other than that\\, he does jack all.\\n\\nRose dies. Wish I cared\\, but I don't. She was probably my least favorite character. She honestly looked like someone cosplaying a background Star Wars character rather than a legitimate character. \\n\\nYoda shows up to pull at the nostalgia strings in older fans. I've heard enough people praising them for bringing Frank Oz back for the role and using a muppet for the character. While i'm also happy he gets work again as Yoda like in the classic days does that actually make the movie better\\, objectively? What does it add? How does Yoda being done that way make the bad parts of the movie better? It doesn't.\\n\\nThe Critics Consensus on this site says\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\" This isn't true\\, this movie does dishonor to the OT. I grew up with the Prequels (born in the 1990s) and I prefer the Prequels to this. If I were to rank all the episodic Star Wars movies\\, it would be:\\n\\n1. Empire Strikes Back\\n2. Star Wars\\n3. Return of the Jedi\\n4. The Force Awakens (on my first viewing\\, this was 2nd\\, Every rewatch\\, it drops a place)\\n5. Attack of the Clones\\n6. The Last Jedi\\n7. Revenge of the Sith\\n8. The Phantom Menace\\n\\nStar Wars isn't for the people it used to be for. This transition from passion Star Wars to a more \\\"general audience\\\" friendly\\, YA-novel Star Wars. The lore and canon is made less complex overall\\, everything was thrown away if it wasn't from a movie or tv show that is available on a massive scale (Who reads the old books and the old comics? Not nearly as many that are at least vaguely familiar with the movies and the 3D tv show because those were nerdy. I know because in the early 2000s when I would read those books in elementary school\\, I would be teased for liking Star Wars. It wasn't cool back then like it was now).\\n\\nIt's like when LEGO rebooted Bionicle. Bionicle Gen 2 restarted the story with the same characters\\, but they didn't call it a reboot but a \\\"soft reboot\\\" that tied into the original lore-rich story if old-school fans looked hard enough but was sufficiently simplified and distant from Gen 1 that new fans wouldn't feel discouraged from jumping in. It didn't work for LEGO but it will work for Disney because they're Disney\\, milking franchises in every which is what they do. It's brand dilution. If old fans fall away\\, that's fine; new fans will always be there in the tween-teen years to take their place and spend their money as well as mom's and dad's money.\\n\\nMy friend feels the same way: Star Wars' quality and dignity has taken a dive overall. There's a reason the original movies have stayed in the public's mind so long: the OT were all objectively good movies that transcend trends\\, pop culture\\, and time. They will never be dated. These new movies will\\, but Disney's okay with that because there will be a new one every year to distract people from the lack of substance. The market is oversaturated with Star Wars and that's what Disney wants.\\n\\nThe movies have to be good enough to tide people over till the next one. Lord knows the Force Awakens was only good to me until a few months shy of Rogue One. Then I started to see the flaws\\, the repetition\\, the tropes\\, the cliches and the terrible non-arc the main character had. But\\, oh look! A new star wars movie in December!\\n\\nOverall\\, this year I was looking forward more to Justice League and The Disaster Artist more than this movie and I was right. I enjoyed Justice League and I absolutely loved The Disaster Artist\\, it made me feel hatred and sympathy for a character so naturally. This Star Wars movie wont be remembered by me\\, but Tumblr blogs dedicated more to the sexual orientations of the main characters rather than actual story will love it (Kylo is shirtless in this movie and everyone is raving about his 8-pack\\, because that's important to the story I guess). \\n\\nI never thought I would be disappointed by Star Wars twice in less than a month but between EA's Battlefront 2 (story AND microtransaction shady-ness) and The Last Jedi\\, Disney and Star Wars has left a bad taste in my mouth I wont soon wash out.","true":true}
