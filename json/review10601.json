Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Greets.\\n\\nLet's have an adult discussion about this movie. Let's examine why older people like me (52) find the movie to be on the wrong side of meh.\\n\\nThe best way of analysing this is through the responses on this forum. You have to register to send a review\\, and more to the point\\, the negative reviews are encapsulated with people like me who take a lot of time and effort to make a detailed\\, negative response. This is because we care. The positive reviews on the other hand are mostly made up of people giving one-line material\\, much as they would do for any other action movie. You don't see many detailed positive reviews\\, negative reviews do\\, however.\\n\\nThis doesn't matter too much in terms of box office and merchandising\\, after all\\, we do need to see the movie to review it\\, but it has enormous consequences in the longer term\\, and for Disney\\, the stated aim is to milk (like a sea beast!) the franchise for all it is worth. If your core fan base decide that the product is only worth pirating (which of course\\, we strongly object to for legal and ethical reasons)\\, then your plan has the good chance of diminishing returns.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens (TFA) was a decent movie. It was a pretty good reboot movie on the lines of Star Trek\\, but let's face it\\, there was nothing original about it. Most of the components were copy\/pasted over from previous instalments\\, and thus it lacked a lot of character. Nevertheless\\, for the difficulty involved a la Bladerunner\\, it was a very good execution for something you could get executed for.\\n\\nRogue One on the other hand was a superb film self-contained in its own right\\, with believable characters that you cared for and an ending that seemed just and within keeping of the pantheon.\\n\\nSo there was huge hopes with The Last Jedi (TLJ). The hard work had been completed in TFA\\, the introduction of new characters\\, the out with old and in with new tropes with Han Solo\\, and the re imagining of the threat from the Empire.\\n\\nAnd this is where TLJ fails utterly. We don't really care about the characters one way or the other. Take Poe Dameron. Poe is to be the Han Solo character but completely lacks the charisma\\, humour\\, sang froid\\, and spunkiness of the original and best. Would people really care if he dies in this movie?\\n\\nHow about Finn? In TFA Finn was a great character with a really interesting character story arc with Rey. In TLJ there is no character arc for Finn other than running around pointless plot cul-de-sacs that would be better off exploring something like\\, oh I don't know\\, character development and interesting story arc lines?\\n\\nKylo Ren is just another angst-riven Anakin Skywalker evil\/good\/gosh this is complicated BS that serves as meaningless metaphors in some PC-driven universe.\\n\\nRey is great\\, you can care for Rey\\, but one out of four is a bad return. Speaking of which\\, why on earth is everyone sucked into the ''Rey was sold for booze money for junk rat parents'' line from Kylo Ren of all people. Seeing as at the time\\, he directly opposes her\\, is it not possible that he mighty be.....lying? Expect a boringly predictable reveal next episode.\\n\\nThe ''secondary'' characters fare worse. The whole point behind the Snork\/Kylo Ren\/General Hux triumvirate is to allow them to rub and clash against each other\\, particularly Hux and Ren. All this set up was for nothing and Hux is left a pathetic laughing stock - without the humour\\, Snork is killed off in a casual and irrelevant manner and Ren becomes the default bad guy even though we all know he's not that bad.\\n\\nDid you know\\, Mr Johnson. that's it's possible to be evil\\, clever\\, organised\\, tactically astute and make people want to rise up against you? Why then in TLJ is evil so incompetent\\, pathetic\\, asinine and forgettable?\\n\\nThe tertiary characters? Why bother with C-3PO and R2D2 at all? Why bother with Chewie? What is Rose's function in all of this? Why the skype call with Maz? I actually like Laura Dern but the BS plot device on her ''cunning plan'' derailed her character completely. Captain Phasma could have been....something. Not just a pathetic waste of space.\\n\\nWhen Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace or propping up a bar somewhere) died\\, surely you must have had some thoughts as to how to deal with the tragedy? Having her die in the explosion of the command pod would have been just and correct. Now we have the appalling vista of her CGIness appearing in the next movie with everyone knowing it's completely fake. \\n\\nWe won't bother going into the plot holes\\, others have done to great extent. There have always been plot holes in Star Wars\\, but that's perfectly acceptable to a low budget western set in outer space from 1977\\, 1980 and 1983. With the infinite resources of Disney\\, access to the internet\\, numerous universities and bodies of knowledge and wisdom\\, do you think you could have made a movie that at least respects physics in some meaningful way?\\n\\nUnlike others\\, I don't have an issue with the PC brigade of ensuring all the main characters are as diverse as possible. But if that is the case\\, where are the aliens? Don't aliens count as a special politically correct class too? The only aliens in the movie that count are the hamster\/puffins and semi-intelligent ice-foxes. Where are all the other species in the Star Wars universe? Are they not intelligent enough to have a starring role too? They could even be on the dark side\\, seeing as intelligence is not necessary in an audition.\\n\\nIn summary. Rian Johnson is the Dark Side of the Force. We know this because he has shown incompetence\\, a complete lack of understanding of the SW multiverse\\, a removal of all the available characters and plot lines from TFA\\, and worst of all\\, failed to complete what was a fairly simple job.\\n\\nGoodnight and God bless","true":true}
