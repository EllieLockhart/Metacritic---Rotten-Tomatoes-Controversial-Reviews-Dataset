Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily\\, the Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie in the entire saga. Here we have Disney pushing their liberal\\, feminist propaganda.  The Last Jedi assassinated the charm and wit of the original characters and introduced one-dimensional\\, caricature puppets to carry the torch. No thank you!","true":true}
