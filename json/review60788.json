We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last of Us Part II is a hard bit of story to rival. Naughty Dog created TLOU about 7 years ago\\, putting us through the journey of Joel and Ellie. We fell in love with those characters and shared their struggles. We felt their loss. We started TLOU2 with hopes that after everything those characters would live happily ever after\\, but the world of TLOU is dark and rarely ends happily.The Last of Us Part II is a hard bit of story to rival.

We started TLOU2 with hopes that after everything those characters would live happily ever after\\, but the world of TLOU is dark and rarely ends happily. Without spoilers\\, TLOU2 faces the uphill battle of making you care about a character that starts off almost irredeemable. In my time with the story\\, I felt a wide range of emotions for this character and others. When I finally finished the last scene of the game\\, I was left with the satisfied feeling of a story that felt total\\, complete\\, and moving. The game deals with\\, represents\\, and successfully addresses topics like sexuality\\, ideology\\, and morals that are hard or tense to discuss with ease. It does so in a way that provides a bridge to relate to characters in a way that allows you to overcome their differences and appreciate the ways that they emotionally connect with you as the player.Gameplay wise\\, TLOU2 plays a lot like TLOU. The melee combat is more refined and satisfying\\, and the fighting scenes are most intense and sometimes more chaotic. A few added parts to the gameplay include the ability to manipulate infected interacting or attacking your enemies in an organic way. Exploring the world and it\u2019s secret corners often goes rewarded with lore and loot. There are plenty of fights that are available but not essential to the story as you go.Graphic and sound quality is outstanding. Naughty Dog pushed the PS4 to its absolutely limit\\, and it\u2019s an outstanding comparison to games at the beginning of the PS4\u2019s lifecycle until now when we\u2019re approaching its end.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
