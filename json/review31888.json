Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler alert!!! Strange and unsatisfying. It's bad when the best light saber scene is Rey and kylo versus security guards no suspense their! No good answers to snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, story line sucked\\, too long\\, almost fell asleep in the middle\\, no epic scenes from this one. Makes me lose hope don't really care about next episode.","true":true}
