Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As I look around the Internet and see fan reaction to \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" I get this general impression. Fans didn't like \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" because it was too similar. Now fans don't like \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" because it's too different. I definitely have my issues with some of the story logic and some of the scenes (one sequence in particularly was just so poorly conceived and executed). In general\\, however\\, I really liked this entry quite a bit. While I had many places I'd like to have gone\\, ideas I wanted for it\\, and to have my Star Wars fanboy desired fulfilled\\, I like how Rian Johnson played with and undercut expectations laying the ground for new\\, fresh stories for the Future of Star Wars. So far\\, I'd say the new movies\\, so far have hovered at \\\"The Return of the Jedi\\\" level of\\, good additions to the Star Wars franchise\\, but haven't transcended into excellent films the way the first \\\"Star Wars\\\"\\, and \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" did.","true":true}
