Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of times where you think you know where it's going and it surprises you with a changeup. Has the typical time\/space realism problems of other Star Wars movies\\, but that's a minor concern. Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo Ren are in particularly fine form throughout and strong character development is focused on Poe Dameron - not bad for a character who wasn't originally going to survive the first movie.","true":true}
