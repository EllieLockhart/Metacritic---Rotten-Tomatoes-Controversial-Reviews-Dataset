Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let down by this movie not because it is bad just not well thought out. Plot gets lost and common sense goes out the wind because of lazy writing. 40 minutes of this movie and the deaths of most of what was left of the resistance could have been avoided if Poe was told what was going on. So much of what I felt force awakens had built never amounted to anything is this movie. Many other plot holes from how physics in space works to how did rey get back to the falcon became to many for me to enjoy this movie. ","true":true}
