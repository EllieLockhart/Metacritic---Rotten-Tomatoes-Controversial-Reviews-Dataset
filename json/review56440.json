Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography of this movie is stunning.  I actually like the new cast of characters and I don't have a problem with a reboot of Star Wars.  I thought Rogue One was a good movie and enjoyed The Force Awakens\\, even though I had some issues with it.  But I feel the script in this movie is the major failing.  There are plot holes galore that are more obvious than in the first film because the pacing of this movie is much slower.  Much of my issues could be ignored if the character of Luke Skywalker had been treated differently.  I was even okay with Luke dying\\, although I feel it would have been better for that in the third movie.  But\\, Rian Johnson's Luke Skywalker is not my Luke Skywalker.  \\nRian Johnson should not have to tear down Luke Skywalker in order to build up the new characters.   Even though I don't agree with how Luke is portrayed\\, I will say that Mark Hamill gives an amazing and heartfelt performance.  I am disappointed mostly because this movie could have been so much more than it is.","true":true}
