Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1.5 stars. Spoilers are coming next\\, reader beware. Soooooo many plot holes\\, 30 years we waited to see some cool Luke Skywalker scenes and we were let down. No cool training scenes with Rey and they even screwed his death up. Buckle up for the new PC star wars. The next star wars I watch will be on Kodi through my amazon fire stick. Fool me once and fooled me twice.","true":true}
