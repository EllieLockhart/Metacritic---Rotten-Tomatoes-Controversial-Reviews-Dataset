Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No character development. Full of plot holes. All of the questions that were setup in episode 7 went unanswered in episode 8. It's like Rian Johnson threw out everything JJ Abram's did. This trilogy has no real vision to it. It feels like fan-fiction\\, not a true Star Wars movie.At least with the prequels\\, they had a vision and a coherent beginning-middle-end. This trilogy does not. Rey is far too powerful in comparison to past Jedis or force users for that matter. A lot of the criticisms of her being a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" seem justified. She just seems too perfect. Too sterile\\, even. Daisy Ridley does a good job with what she's given but still...the character of Rey is disappointing overall.\\n\\nI'd have to rate The Last Jedi as maybe 2.5 stars out of 5. The only Star Wars movie I'd rate below this one would be Attack of the Clones\\, episode 2. I'd gladly watch the prequels before this movie though because the pacing was much better and the story was more riveting. Disney has not shown they have ANY clue on what to do with the Star Wars franchise. This is\\, quite frankly\\, a mess of a movie.","true":true}
