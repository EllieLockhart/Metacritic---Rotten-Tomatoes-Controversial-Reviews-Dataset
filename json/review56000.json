Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Second only to Empire. \\nKylo accomplishes something Vader was never able to do\\, yet he is still in Vader's shadow. And he will spend the rest of his life trying to get out of it. \\nI love how it shows Luke's humanity. The moral dilemma: do I kill my nephew and answer to my sister and brother in law? Or do I let him live and live with what he becomes? \\nThe slow chase was really well done. The suspense was real and Poe's determination to do whatever possible to save the Resistance\\, even half baked plans\\, showed how desperate the situation was.","true":true}
