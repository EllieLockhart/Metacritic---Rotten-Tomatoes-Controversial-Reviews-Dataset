Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never felt like reviewing a film before but I'm just so shocked by the silly ratings this film is getting i feel i have to because i loved it. The acting was great almost without exception - I thought Adam Driver was a stand out - from a bit of a weak character in TFA to a real screen presence in this one. And to me it was a treat to see Mark Hamill\/Luke again as the jaded last Jedi. Visually the movie was astonishing and beautiful to watch. The action was thrilling and the comedy delivered some real belly laughs. Sure there were some illogical parts to the plot but how realistic is any Star Wars movie? The story swept along with such verve and panache it more than made up for any questionable plot devices. Overall i loved this movie.","true":true}
