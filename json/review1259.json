Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pretty good movie with interestic visuals and aesthetics. However\\, it also has a somewhat messy plot that can be either rushed in some places and even non sensical in others (Leia I'm looking at you). Not the best Star Wars movie but definitely not the worse.","true":true}
