Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Common complaints I have heard about \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d\\, and why I think you should reconsider. *** THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! DO NOT SCROLL DOWN IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN THE FILM YET!!!*** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** **************************************************************************** 1. \u201cWho is Snoke? We should have seen more character development with him.\u201d Before episodes 1\\, 2\\, and 3\\, no one knew Emperor Palpatine\u2019s back story\\, but it didn\u2019t take away from the greatness of the original trilogy. Even after we learned of Palpatine\u2019s back story in episodes 1\\, 2\\, and 3\\, it wasn\u2019t all that glorious. Simply put\\, he was a manipulative\\, power hungry political figure who turned to the dark side in attempts to rule the galaxy. I think it\u2019s safe to say that we can assume the same of Snoke. Do we really need more than that? 2. \u201cKylo Ren killing Snoke was a cop out. I wanted more story!\u201d Kylo Ren was trying to be just like Grandpa Vader\\, so of course he killed his master. It makes perfect sense. Even after Ren kills Snoke\\, he follows once again in Darth Vader\u2019s footsteps by trying to recruit Rey to his own New Order. 3. \u201cWho are Rey\u2019s parents? We still don\u2019t know!\u201d The whole point of The Last Jedi was to show us that ANYONE could wield the force\\, and that you don\u2019t have to be from a long line of jedi to make a difference in the rebellion. The fact that Rey is one of the most powerful jedi of all time\\, and her parents were drunks who sold her into slavery shows that the rebellion isn\u2019t going to die\\, and that there\u2019s still hope for the galaxy\\, and that hope will be found in other normal people just like Rey. This concept is reaffirmed at the very end of the film when we see the little boy use the force to pick up his broom\\, stare longingly into the stars\\, and hold that broom like a light saber in the name of the rebellion\\, ready to fight whatever came his way. The identity of her parents is wildly insignificant in comparison to the greater story being told\\, and the theme that the movie is trying to portray. Even if we knew her parent\u2019s names\\, or saw their faces\\, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference moving forward in the story. 4. \u201cThere was too much comedy. The movie was too kid friendly. Jar Jar would be proud.\u201d Every Star Wars movie\\, including the original trilogy\\, had comedic relief consistently sprinkled throughout the entirety of the story. Obviously providing every instance where this occurred could get lengthy\\, but just to name a few\\, pay attention to the VERY BEGINNING of \u201cA New Hope\u201d with the interactions between C3PO and R2-D2\\, the first time Luke meets Yoda in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d\\, and when Leia tells Han she loves him\\, and his response is \u201cI know.\u201d Yes\\, Jar Jar was awful. I agree whole-heartedly. However\\, comparing Jar Jar to the comedic relief we see in The Last Jedi is a complete over exaggeration. 5. \u201cThe porgs were awful\u2026 They served no purpose at all. We could completely remove them from the movie\\, and nothing would change.\u201d The one character who we see in The Last Jedi who interacts with the porgs more than anyone else is Chewy. With Han Solo being dead\\, our big furry friend has taken on a much larger responsibility than he ever has before\\, not just with piloting the Millennium Falcon\\, but with becoming a legitimate stand-alone character. Whereas in the past\\, Chewy was another character who mostly provided comedic relief who also complimented Han Solo\u2019s character who played a more serious role\\, now Chewy must take on the responsibility of filling this more serious role\\, and in a sense\\, do the best he can to fill the shoes of Han. However\\, he can\u2019t talk\\, and Rey is certainly not his side-kick. How did The Last Jedi fix this problem? They paired Chewy with an even fuzzier\\, cuter character to create a contrast. We see this when Chewy is flying the Falcon in the midst of an incredibly intense battle\\, and one of the porgs is standing on the dashboard screaming and causing commotion. Chewy pushes the porg off the dashboard\\, grips the yoke\\, and continues to fight in the battle against the approaching New Order. It\u2019s a subtle scene\\, but it was necessary in showing us that Chewy has stepped out of his simple role of being a big fuzzy teddy bear with the lovable \u201cGRAAHHHH\u201d. He\u2019s a legitimate fighter in the rebel alliance. The porgs needed to be created to give us that contrast\\, and to provide Chewy with that stepping stone into a more prominent role in the Star Wars series. 6. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I just think it was boring.\u201d I would love to see what kind of movies you watch. Seriously. Show me.","true":true}
