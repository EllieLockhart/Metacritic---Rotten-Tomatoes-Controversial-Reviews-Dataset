Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What did I watch?  That was a horrible mess\\\".  Totally disappointed.  Too many issues to list but I'll try anyway.  1. Poe joking with Hux.  2. Leia surviving in space and flying.  3. Slowest space chase ever.  4. Sent some random girl and FINN (who was escaping) on an impossibly stupid mission to a casino? 4. Everything that happens at the casino.  5.  What character was Mark Hammill playing? 6. Rey is a shell of a character.  Zero development. 7. Yeah we do kinda want to Know Rey's history. 8. Why are we watching some exotic animal get milked? 9. Snoke was a waste. 10. I wish Finn and rose would have just died like the 300 other stormtroopers standing around them did.","true":true}
