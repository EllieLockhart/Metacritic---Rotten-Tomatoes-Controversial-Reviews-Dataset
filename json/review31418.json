Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some of the jokes felt a little bit off for the film\\, but overall I enjoyed it. Second half was very entertaining\\, first half was good but nothing amazing. Good movie!","true":true}
