Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst star wars movie ever. Disney has ruined the franchise. force awakens set us up for some awesome story telling opportunities in TLJ. Then they did nothing with it. luke was betrayed by Disney that was no heroes death. snoke nothing. rey nothing parents drunken junk traders come on and explain how she can use a light saber that good not even anakin could do that oh ya junk traders.. i was 5 when I went to new hope\\, i think this may have been my last star wars. I don't think Disney even gives a crap. fire Johnson immediately. ","true":true}
