Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Theres more bad to say than good. As an avid star wars fan from being a young boy I have to say I am hugely let down this movie. When I watch Force Awakens\\, i feel like it is star wars\\, but this\\, i feel like it's more of a (badly done) spin off. The character development of Finn Rey and Poe is alright but Poe lacks any involvement really. \\n\\nTo summarise\\, I would rate this as the worst of all star wars movies and Rian Johnson should hang his head in SHAME. I am hoping that JJ Abrams will direct the next one.","true":true}
