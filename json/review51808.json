Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A failure to not only rival.\\, but exceed the prequels. The only thing that I caN give this cinematic blunder is mark hamill's acting\\, the beautiful animation and cinematography\\, and the score. the confusing\\, hole ridden plot and flimsy\\, mary sue of a main character ruin the movie. To think we abandoned the expanded universe for this.","true":true}
