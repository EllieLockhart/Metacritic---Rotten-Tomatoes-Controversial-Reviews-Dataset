Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pathetic attempt to steer this great storyline to a new direction. Politics allows differing viewpoints\\, but this movie went 180 degrees away from the established and accepted character traits of the few remaining stars who carried this franchise to where it was (not is anymore). Luke\\, wanting to kill a boy in his sleep? No chance. Leia; no longer cantankerous and energetic? Really? Poe is someone every army\/fighting group needs during war; not being told what the plan is?? No real training sequence of any depth for Rey? Really? Zero background info on Snoke\\, where he came from\\, how he got there\\, nothing...Why did Luke leave a secret map to find him if he rejected everything to help the rebels? Some humorus spots were good\\, but in general this is truly the Anti Star Wars film. Disney and Rian Johnson wanted to gut it all\\, and they did just that.","true":true}
