Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A perfectly packed film\\, full Humour\\, sorror and surprises. It's not the Empire Strikes Back of Star Wars and it doesn't try to be. This film does have it's dark side and some of the characters storylines could of had a bit more to them. But It's a film where multiple viewing is a must to understand.","true":true}
