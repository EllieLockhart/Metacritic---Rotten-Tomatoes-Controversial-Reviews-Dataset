Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They tried to make their own Guardians of the Galaxy.\\nNow they've failed at both doing that and doing a worthy Star Wars movie.\\nFurthermore\\, the new trilogy is harmed beyond repair.\\nIf I was J J Abrams\\, I would step down from making Episode IX. \\nThey spit on his previous work\\, now let them try to pull their heads out of the whole they've dug by themself.\\n\\nWait until this movie is up for (legal) streaming\\, it's not worth the ticket.","true":true}
