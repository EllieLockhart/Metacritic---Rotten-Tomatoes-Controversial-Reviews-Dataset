Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Non-spoiler review) Loved the movie as a whole\\, there are parts I would have done differently for sure\\, but overall a great addition to the saga. I look forward to seeing how this film rolls into IX.","true":true}
