Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this new addition to the Star Wars franchise. I thought Luke's story and ending was partiuclarly fitting and the film presented many 'kickass' moments. There was lots of space fighting which for me was ace! There were weird bits that needed explaining not to mention who the fuck Snoke is. Overall a great movie. It pisses me off when people say it was rubbish. NO STAR WARS FILM IS RUBBISH and should be rated 57%. Just some are better than others. I feel this was better than most","true":true}
