Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very poor excuse for a Star Wars film. Every iconic character was altered so dramatically that I can only assume this movie was made by somebody that either doesn't understand what made Star Wars great\\, or by somebody that hates the franchise. The choreography is painfully bad. Take a close look at the fight scene in the throne room. A real close look. You can see some people waiting their turn to attack Rey and Kylo. There was a part where 3 guards attack Rey simultaneously. She sparta kicks the dude in the middle\\, but all 3 fall back with him.I don't even want to get started on how this movie treated Luke. The Last Jedi makes the prequels look award worthy by comparison. The only pro this movie has is that it looks nice. That's it.","true":true}
