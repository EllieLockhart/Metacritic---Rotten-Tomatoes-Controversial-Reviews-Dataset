{"101487":101105,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-01-02","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All I can say is \\\"wow!\\\". Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a risk taker but also familiar - like two sides of the same coin. \\n\\nOur beloved characters both old and new are put through a \\\"meat grinder\\\" (to quote Johnson)\\, taking pathways and journeys most people most likely wouldn't expect. Therefore\\, I suggest going into The Last Jedi with low expectations\\, because your wildest theories or fantasies are probably not going to go the way you think. \\n\\nRey\\, Kylo and Luke are definitely the highlight characters of this movie\\, making it very centred around them and their relationships to the force and their pasts. Mark Hamill's reprisal as Luke Skywalker is probably his best performance of the character. The rest of the cast are pretty damn good too\\, although some characters are arguably still underused\\, but have much more of an impact this time around. Finn and Rose's storyline\\, adjacent to the main plot\\, is questionable\\, but doesn't take you out of the movie too much. Carrie Fishers final reprisal of Leia was astounding\\, and much more articulate in this film compared to The Force Awakens. However\\, there is one scene (that I will not mention)\\, that really pulls on the heart strings but makes you gasped in curiosity. It will also make you think \\\"did that just happen?\\\" and \\\"would that really have happened?\\\" \\n\\nThe humour in this movie is fantastic\\, despite some moments falling flat or having you ask yourself (again)  \\\"would that have happened\\\". The porgs are very much comic-relief in this film\\, but don't over do it. They appear every now and then. \\n\\nQuestions are definitely answered in TLJ\\, but I think some fans will be satisfied while others won't be. Our emotions\\, preconceived speculation and theories are definitely played with. \\n\\nThe action sequences are arguably some of the best in all of Star Wars\\, although most Star Wars films deliver that. The space battles are full of suspense and seat clenching action\\, and it happens earlier on in the film than you would think. \\n\\nOverall\\, the film is ballsy\\, and definitely takes a risk - especially with our beloved characters\\, effectively turning them upside down rather than following a predictable path - something we most definitely see with Luke. He isn't who we expect him to be\\, but there are still traits that we'd expect from him. Only a few nitpicks with humour and a few scenes\\, but the majority of the film is solid\\, referring back to the lore and tieing things in. \\n\\n8.5\/10","true":true}
