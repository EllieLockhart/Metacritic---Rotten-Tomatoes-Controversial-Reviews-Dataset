Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi - More like the last Star Wars movie I'll see on the big screen. After waiting so long for this\\, I felt after watching it I'd been hoodwinked. I felt betrayed\\, my childhood raped. Rian completely ruined Star Wars for many fans. He completely ignored everything J.J. setup in TFA\\, and took a big steaming dump on it\\, whilst giving us original fans the middle finger. Sure\\, as Lucas said\\, it was beautifully made\\, but the incoherent plot\\, pointless characters\\, Mary Poppins Leia and the complete mishandling of Lukes legacy \\, makes me wish I never saw this\\, whatever you can call it. I urge any diehard Star Wars fan to avoid this flick\\, and preserve the fond memories of the original 6. Such a shame\\, there were so many missed opportunities. Rian you had so much to work with. Why?","true":true}
