Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VIII is interesting. Either you loved it or you hated it. TLJ seems a bit out of place with its somewhat darker tone and story. It features the protagonist\\, Rey\\, seeking out Jedi master Luke Skywalker and her relationship with Ben Solo AKA Kylo Ren. All in all\\, this movie is okay. It\u2019s not great\\, it\u2019s not terrible\\, it\u2019s simply okay. ","true":true}
