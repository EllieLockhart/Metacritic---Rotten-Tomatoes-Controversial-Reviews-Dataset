The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game is phenomenal. Not as good as the first but sequels coming off a game that good rarely are. The characters and world are as detailed as ever and making loving or hating them feel so impactful. I was almost certain the game would start with Joel being killed\\, considering who he was and the consequences of the choices he made in the first game\\, and through his 20 years of survival. His death was harsh and sudden\\, fitting the bleak grounded tone of the previous game\\, and the lifestyle he thought he might outrun. It portrays his acceptance of the consequence well\\, showing the final piece of his arch that he knew he was getting what he deserved. So it was tough\\, but set the rest of the game in motion. Ellie's fall from grace is a hot topic of debate but it makes sense to me. She was always troubled by survival\\, and needing meaning in her immunity. Chasing Joel's killer\\, as well as the relationships strained along the way\\, was a strong story of coming to terms with being a villian\\, just as the fjrst game was. I think people forgot at the end of the day she's been with Joel\\, a true villian\\, for a while mow\\, and they shouldn't have been surprised she took on his world view. Regardless\\, the writing is great\\, the acting even greater\\, and the graphics prove ND still knows to inch every ounce of horsepower out of this gens PS. It's a hell of a ride\\, but one worth taking. It'll hurt\\, its not always perfect\\, but its so damn good.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
