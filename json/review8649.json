Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time I've ever written a review.  I can't recall being as disappointed by any other movie.  While the prequels were badly done\\, they didn't completely destroy characters and lore like this movie does.  Absolutely terrible plot\\, poor pacing\\, it's remarkable how such a bad product could be made.  There are so many amazing stories that could be possible with Star Wars\\, but instead we were given this.  Luke shouldn't have been the hero of this trilogy\\, but no reason to change his story so much.  Finn and Rose's entire subplot should have been cut\\, and so many other problems with this movie.","true":true}
