Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney...wtf?  Have you people never seen a Star Wars movie before?  I cannot believe how bad this movie is!!\\n\\nMy expectations weren't high...I guess you could say I had a bad feeling about this movie (and where was that line in this film??).\\n\\nI had no idea I would leave a Star Wars movie feeling as empty as I did.  Really\\, not trying to be dramatic but it is that bad.  Maybe worse.\\n\\nMy husband hated it.  The friends we went with hated it.  The kids with us hated it.  Not sure who Disney was trying to appeal to...liberal\\, man-hating\\, socialistic vegans?\\n\\nI want my SW back!  Fine\\, the old characters have had their day\\, I can accept that.   I like Rey\\, Kylo\\, Finn and Poe but they didn't even seem to move in this movie.  Instead we got Rose (please\\, don't come back in the next installment!) and Benecio Del Toro\\, whom I liked\\, but even he seemed like a shadow in this movie and then was gone.\\n\\nI don't know how this can be redeemed if at all.  Please\\, give a redo and all will be forgiven.  If you continue this way\\, you can count this fan done.","true":true}
