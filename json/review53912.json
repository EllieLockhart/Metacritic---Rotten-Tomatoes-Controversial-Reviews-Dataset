Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came out of the theater so disappointed in The Last Jedi. I watched it again on Blu ray to give it another try\\, I wanted it so badly to be at least a decent Star Wars movie. But it is extremely awful. The Your Mamma Joke at the beginning was really lame. The infamous Leia flying scene\\, which is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. And the whole Canto Bight scene should have been completely changed. But my most biggest disappointment was the way they did Luke Skywalker\\, I could forgive all the other numerous stupid things in the movie\\, but what they did to Luke Skywalker was unforgivable. Just HORRIBLE writing and story telling. Of all the stories Rian Johnson could have come up with\\, THIS crap was the best he could do? And nobody in Lucasfilm looked over his work and said something!? This is ridiculous! They need to completely delete this movie and remake Epidsode VIII.","true":true}
