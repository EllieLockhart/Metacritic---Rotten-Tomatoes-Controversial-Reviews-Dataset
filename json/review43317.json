Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great movie\\, and is one of my favorites in the whole series. Its long\\, sure\\, and has some awkward moments. But damn\\, this kept me on my toes. It made me laugh\\, slip into sadness\\, cheer\\, and say \\\"what the F***!\\\". When I hear my folks talk about the original series\\, thats exactly how they felt. So whats the problem? Whatever the case\\, this fan gives it a double thumbs up!","true":true}
