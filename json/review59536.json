We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I heard that when the first game was about Love\\, this was themed around hate\\, so this was something that I thought about a lot during my playtime.  It is hard to get someone to explore negative emotions and come out feeling good\\, and I feel that a lot of that this game was getting at was that death is painful to deal with\\, we don't all go out in meaningful ways.\r\rI felt that there was a bit of a gameplay lull in the middle similar to Alien: Isolation where after you get powerful and reach a climactic point\\, everything resets to the new character which is a little unsatisfying.\r\rGameplay-wise\\, I felt that the rarer infected functioned a lot better and were more interesting than the first game and the newer variants were interesting.  A big issue for me in the first one was simplistic\\, repeating puzzles.  I feel that this game had some more interesting and original mechanics for puzzles which I appreciated.  I wasn't as big a fan of the brute type human enemies or the chase scene\\, horse escape that felt a little too much like Uncharted for me.\r\rI think the takeaway message is loss sucks but it's something we have to deal with in life\\, exploring the emotions and the way that hate destroys so much around us with no real catharsis is a bold move\\, and I did feel myself getting emotionally invested.\r\rOverall I think that the game might have been too long to make it's a point well\\, but I advise people to see it through to the end.  If you are at all on the fence\\, I suggest waiting for a price drop.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
