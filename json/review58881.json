On the pros side\\, tlou2 has stunning beautiful graphics\\, with lush tall grass to snipe baddies from that looks incredible to say the least on a 4k tv. Like the game before it the voice acting is top notch as well. Where the game falls short on sadly is the story. Its neither a 0 or a 10 which gamers seem to be on an unwinnable war on. Its more of a 5\/10 or 6\/10. Killing a beloved character in the way they chose to was an unfortunate mistake\\, but they took a gamble. I think it was less about politics and more for shock\\, but the end result leaves the game feeling like a somewhat better written story for a Death Wish movie that would have landed better if the antagonist ultimately met their demise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
