Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I found this pretty disappointing. I don't want to post spoilers so I'll just say that visuals and sound were very good as always. The scripts and the characters were also very good. However the story itself was a huge let down. My main gripes are the wasted potential of some villains who are meant to be extremely powerful in the star wars universe.\\nThe blatant merchandising\\, with some form of cuddly toy looking animal available for all ages of genders.\\nThe ridiculous 'chase' of rebel ships. Why the Imperials didn't just light speed ahead of them I don't know.\\nBut the main gripe; the cheap gags. Luke throwing a lightsabre\\, Fin falling out of bed\\, Rey breaking some cart. Cheap attempts at slapstick humour that brought down the entire feel of the film.","true":true}
