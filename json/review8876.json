Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the most part good. I had high expectations going in and it met them. There were a couple scenes I didn't like including one scene that is in contention for worst scene in any star wars movie\\, maybe even worse than that live scene in episode 2. Questions were left unanswered and certain characters were left too undeveloped. But in the end\\, it was well done\\, not over cutesy\\, and action packed. ","true":true}
