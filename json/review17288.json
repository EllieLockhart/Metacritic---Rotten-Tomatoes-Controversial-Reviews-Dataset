Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie...and\\, disclaimer\\, I am a Star Wars fan.  That being said\\, Star Wars Title or not\\, this film was just...not good.  My primary reasons for this feeling can be summed up in my overall dissatisfaction with the story itself.  Half the movie was dominated by a side quest that\\, in the end\\, served no purpose whatsoever.  The other half of the film was basically the slowest\\, most boring space chase to ever make it to the silver screen.  Aside from this primary reason\\, the complete betrayal of the Luke Skywalker character; the Mary Poppins Princess scene; the once again underutilized Captain Phasma; and the big bad\\, Supreme Leader Snoke being reduced from major villain to basic plot point\\, just to name a few\\, added to my dislike of the film.  On top of all that\\, they have apparently failed to learn from the prequels\\, and have once again given us a central villain that is not evil\\, but instead just a whiny bitch with Mommy and Daddy issues.  Sigh.  That's not to say that the movie doesn't have some bright spots\\, because it does\\, hence why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  Taking all this into consideration\\, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.","true":true}
