Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a great movie. Very very long and it's really worst than The Force Awakens. The script is poorly written. Just don't work. Got some positive points as Master Yoda scene. But the rest is just disappointing... Why they took off JJ from this episode?","true":true}
