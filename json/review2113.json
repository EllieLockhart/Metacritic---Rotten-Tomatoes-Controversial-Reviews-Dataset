Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As to right now the best Star Wars I ever seen!! I have no clue what these so called fans are talking about! Everyone on the  production and movie set  did a  wonderful job! It's a must see! Don't listen to what I have to say just go see the movie for yourself! Critics did a good job by  rating it above 90 percent! It should be at least be a 98percent! Lol","true":true}
