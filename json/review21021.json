Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was ok with Force awakens for the most part lets face visuals and sounds were great idea of the life of a Storm Trooper making one of them a good guy is like something from G.I.Joe ...i dont know about killing Solo\\, that didn't do anything for me...its a huge negative in the movie infact cos he's my fav. Rouge One though i thought was fine if a little rushed and skipping in story. Last Jedi was an utter shit fest and it seemed to want to nothing more than destroy Star Wars. A bunch of people with money who hate star wars made a Star wars movie to try and kill it. Nothing good happens in Last Jedi. NOTHING. If i gave this film a lower stars than this is would not be counted. This film is dire and i give is another half mark for the great sets and costumes. Sorry Johnson ruined your film.","true":true}
