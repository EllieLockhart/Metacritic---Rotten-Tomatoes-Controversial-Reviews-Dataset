Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen every Star Wars movie in the theater ;however\\, one more garbage movie like this I will end my 1978 year run. I don't know how this got a 90 plus rating. I was hoping they would do a better job than the Force Awaking or what ever you want to call that JUNK. Rogue one was a Star Wars fan movie. Bring these characters back to life and call it Rogue two back from the dead..... it will probably be better that this other JUNK.","true":true}
