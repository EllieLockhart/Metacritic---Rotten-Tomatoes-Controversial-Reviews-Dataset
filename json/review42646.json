Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was completely mind breaking\\, nothing you thought was going to happen\\, happened. Also\\, i have never seen a movie with so many easter eggs\\, it's insane. It opens up so many theories\\, and if you thought you had many questions before the movie\\, ohh boy your in for a treat.","true":true}
