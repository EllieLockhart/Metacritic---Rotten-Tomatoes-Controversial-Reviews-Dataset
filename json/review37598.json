Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"there is not enough space to write how much of a tragidy this movie is in the star wars world.....  the effects and sounds where great.. but every thing else sucked..   i am not even sure how they are going to fix this for the last movie.... \\n\\nthe movie was very slow going . with a very dumb slow side story with a wanna be twilight love story in the works\\,\\,\\,\\, and a 3rd side story that just distorys luke ledgon... and how the hell are they going to have a massive scarry bad guy now....  this movie was beyond disapointing.","true":true}
