Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"loved it!! I don't know what the fuss about let it go!! let's not get stuck in the past we needed something new and fresh while keeping it within the realm of the story. great movie overall","true":true}
