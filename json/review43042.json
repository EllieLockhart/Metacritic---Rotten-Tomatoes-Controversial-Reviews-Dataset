Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very disappointing\\, It is one of the most poorly directed films I have ever seen. Characters and locations are specifically designed to send a political message which bogs the film down it also wastes Andy Serkis\\, Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern in the worst ways possible. Phasma was once again wasted so she was just a marketing tool. There were also tonnes of continuity errors that are so obvious they take you out the emerson. Rey once again faced no obstacles and makes Luke a Jedi look like a bumbling idiot. However the battle of Crait was beautiful and it wasn't the worst movie I watched in 2017 but it certainly isn't good.","true":true}
