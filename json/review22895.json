Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look if you hated it the first time\\, just see it again. I left the theater on opening night disappointed and downtrodden. I didn't like some of the choices they had made and I felt betrayed. I spent the weekend coming to terms with the story\\, accepting the things I could not change\\, went to see it again and loved it. Once you let go of your two years of research and theories\\, its just a damn enjoyable ride. \\nThe porgs are subtle and charming\\, Rose and Holdo are wonderful additions to the team\\, the connection between Rey and Kylo\/Ben is haunting and fascinating. I think the lightsaber fight in Snoke's chambers surpasses that even of the Battle of the Heroes. \\nThis movie includes both the best and one of the worst planets in the SW universe: Crait being the best\\, and Canto Bight being the worst. \\nThe Casino scene is uninspired and uninteresting\\, but the battle on Crait is a visual masterpiece. \\nSee it again. This movie is amazing.","true":true}
