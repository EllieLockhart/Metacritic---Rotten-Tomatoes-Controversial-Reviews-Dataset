Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly let down by the fact that this installment of the trilogy completely ruined the perfect canvas set by JJ Abrams. Disney is ruining Star Wars for true fans by not appealing to adult themes and more intricate plot lines. Simply put... Star Wars the Last Jedi killed my Jedi spirit.","true":true}
