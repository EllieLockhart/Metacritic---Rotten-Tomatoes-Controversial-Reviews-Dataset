Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a lot of fun and very entertaining.  I liked the direction they took the story and the interactions between Rae and Luke and Kylo.  I thought having Princess L fly through space with the force was silly\\, but otherwise it was awesome!","true":true}
