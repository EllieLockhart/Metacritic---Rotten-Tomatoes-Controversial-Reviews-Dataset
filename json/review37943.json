Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These new Star Wars movies are just a casual scify movie. It lacks soul\\, no jedi duels nothing new at all. Its like watching a comedy with a bunch of special fx's. They really need to go back to a serious type of movie like the first three. If they want to make movies just for kids\\, they should just keep going with the cartoons. Why ruin it.....","true":true}
