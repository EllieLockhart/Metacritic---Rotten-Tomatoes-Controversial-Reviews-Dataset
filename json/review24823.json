Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest problem is Rian Johnson\u2019s selfish ambition: he wanted to take the story in a different direction to justify his supposed creativity. Why would you try to do something different and kill off Luke in a pathetic state? Disney bought the rights to Star Wars - we can take the story in a different direction for the next 100 years. Why did you have to ruin the original story and characters with your selfish need to be different? BTW\\, Leia flying through space was the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in a movie. Just a big black eye on an otherwise decent film.","true":true}
