Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing acting\\, visuals\\, and action. The expectations whiplash from Force Awakens to Last Jedi was frustrating\\, but forgivable. Guess it's my fault for going down the fan-theory rabbit hole. However\\, Poe Dameron getting a wrist slap for mutiny AND effectively getting 300+ resistance fighters and crew killed with his plan is a big oversight and kind of abusive to his character. I don't think this movie deserves all the hate\\, but I don't think it deserves all of the hype either. It's a solid C+.","true":true}
