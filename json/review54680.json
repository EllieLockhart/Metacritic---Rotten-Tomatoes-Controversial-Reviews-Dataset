Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really felt that they had improved with this movie when it comes to the casual movie go-er looking to have a good time watching a movie. The Latest movies introduced new ships\\, planets\\, animals\\, and characters. Although I did feel that with all the new stuff coming in\\, they had to get rid of old stuff.Tis is where the film started to break down. With the introduction of new characters they had to kill of others. The ones that they did kill\\,(apart from Luke) had little to no backstory and we didn't really get to know them. Captain Phazma\\, a character overall liked was just killed off and when he did die\\, you were pushed to have emotions for a one-dimensional character. Snoke had more known about him but for being the supreme leader of the empire not much is known about him and his backstory. Overall I feel this was a great movie when it comes to the battle and diversity. But lacked in making the hardcore fans happy with the small amount of care that went into the story and the lore revolving around it.","true":true}
