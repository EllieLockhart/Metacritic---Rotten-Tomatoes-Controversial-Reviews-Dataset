Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s a movie in the sense that things are filmed and there\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s dialogue and actors. Other than that? This movie is awful\\, has an incoherent plot and was just a very poor attempt to get Marvel fans and Fort it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s players to get interested in buying merchandise.","true":true}
