Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pure hatred for George Lucas characters. Especially Luke\\, to just become one with the force after what creating a force apparition of himself. All this after making him look like a murderer trying to kill his nephew and a pupil of his. Nice Luke you have gone from saving your Father to trying to kill your nephew and dies the first time he tries a Jedi Trick.  STUPID!","true":true}
