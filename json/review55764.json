Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Over time this movie will be regarded as a great movie\\, but right now some people are not accepting that this is the new canon. Yeah its different from the extended universe\\, old canon\\, and legends\\, but its a ton of fun. A couple of parts could be reshot\\, like Leiah effect when she uses the force (looked cheap)\\, not what she did but the shot \/ effect. People that focus too much on the lore\\, such as \\\"you need force training\\\"\\, \\\"you cant do this\\, you cant do that\\\"\\, then you wont like this movie that much\\, but what those fans need to notice is that this is the new canon\\, not what they think should be the canon. Its less dark than the Empire Strikes Back but I personally liked the jokes and the characters. Its a fun\\, pretty\\, funny movie\\, with probably some of the best fights ever. Some of the fights are awesome and I saw most of theater give it a standing ovation when it happened (which I had a long time without seeing it happen in a movie). Actually there were 3 scenes that most of the theater gave a standing ovation to the movie as it played. Most people in the cinema I went to loved it. I think there are some people that cannot accept the new canon and are being very vocal about it\\, but it was pretty good 8.5\/10 to me. Not perfect but a ton of fun.","true":true}
