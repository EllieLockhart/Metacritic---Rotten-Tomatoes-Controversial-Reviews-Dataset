Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A small update\\, like others have noted 1\/2 star (and maybe even 1 star??) reviews don't count so I'm pushing to 1\\,5 just for the heck of it.\\n\\nAlso want to say that I have come to terms with the abomination that is ep 8\\, by just thinking about it as Disney Canon. It's their version of a possible SW story going forward\\, and I don't give a rats ass about it anymore.\\n\\nVisuals are amazing and it's technically a very well made film.\\n\\nHowever\\, the writer\/director\/whoever's responsible doesn't seem to know much about Star Wars lore established from previous movies. Force powers are now available for anyone without any training it seems. And some powers displayed are far above anything seen before.\\n\\nBut the worst part is what is done to Luke's character\\, totally not believable and against his whole character. It feels like they are pissing on his legacy. Milking a space cow and drinking it's milk with insanity in the eyes - what were they thinking!?\\n\\nStupid \\\"humour\\\" spread out everywhere. Already in the beginning of the movie I had a bad feeling about this\\, given Poes out of place conversation with Hux. Snoke killed of\\, shortly after displaying powers with the force we've never seen\\, suddenly he can't even sense a light saber moving next to him. And who the fuck was he anyway? What's the point of introducing him in ep 7 if he's just cannonfodder after a couple of lines.\\n\\nThere's so much more WTF in this one\\, but they are available to read about in all other comments here.\\n\\nA very weak star for the visuals\\, otherwise a disgrace for a movie and not one that is Star Wars. Since it fails to deliver\\, ep 7 becomes quite pointless as well since it sets the story up that then goes down the drain. \\n\\nFor me\\, the Star Wars saga ends with ROTJ.","true":true}
