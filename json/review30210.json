Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it opening night and I'm still depressed. Plot never advanced and everyone that does goes out like a loser. HUGE opportunity missed. Rain Johnson spit in fans faces just to make the movie different. Rose\/Finn subplot was terrible and the casino planet reminded me of a Harry Potter movie. Terrible writing throughout the movie! Holes everywhere!","true":true}
