Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s a ton of fun! As a middle installment\\, it struck a perfect balance of leaving unanswered questions for the third and final film\\, but still very satisfying for a life long Star Wars fan!","true":true}
