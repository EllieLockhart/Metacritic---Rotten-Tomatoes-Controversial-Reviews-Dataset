Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has done better. Characters were thin  and motivations unconvincing. Some beautifully shot scenes\\, and moments of promise... but no Rogue One\\, and certainly not worth the gush seen from most masthead reviewers. There was no unexpected reinvention here - though Hamill was strong and Rose a nice addition.","true":true}
