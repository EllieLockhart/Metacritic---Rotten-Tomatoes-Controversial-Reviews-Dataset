Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abysmal failure of a Star Wars film\\, To many ideas and things from original trilogy\\, to many plot holes\\, This movie destroyed everything meaningful about this franchise.  How can anyone even go back to the original films and have any respect for Luke and his hero's journey knowing how things turn out in the end? The second most offensive aspect of this movie\\, (after destroying Luke's entire back story\\, and character)\\, was the in your face social social justice diatribe. nobody has to be special or go through any personal journey and rigorous training to be a Jedi; heck everyone can do it. After two movies\\, it is obvious that Rey can do anything\\, so it is impossible for her to grow as a character. Full of plot holes and contrivances\\, involving characters nobody cares about. A Disney reboot and retelling of the entire franchise that destroys the entire cannon also Laura Dern's character was an absolute joke. Such cringeworthy characters\\, Rey is basically a Jedi Knight already with virtually zero training. In The Force Awakens she could fly anything\\, fight anything\\, use the force and even defeat Kylo Ren. I thought at least The Last Jedi might help explain that aspect of Rey as to why she's perfect but it turns out no she just is and that's that. And to boot she don't need no training from Luke. That's poor lazy writing - male or female. She's not an interesting character. ?new films are so disappointing. People praise them on their diversity checklists\\, but other than that and some new special effects\\, the film doesn't do much. It's sad. You may have liked the movie. You are entitled to be wrong.","true":true}
