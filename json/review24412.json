Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More cartoony action than other Star Wars\\, almost unfittingly. It's a different feel for the series\\, but not necessarily a bad one. Some of the artistic choices are almost as surprising as the twists that happen in the plot. Still\\, it does its job to drive an endearing story deeper. It's different\\, but still smart and cohesive.","true":true}
