Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was great! Plenty of unexpected twists and an amazing cast! I was so glad to see certain characters get more fleshed out and they dynamic between Rey and Kylo was so good and interesting ... I cannot wait to see what's in store for them in the next movie!\\n\\nIt was fun to speculate along the last two years but seeing that some \\\"fans\\\" are posting bad reviews because what they thought would happen didn't is sad. It's a beautifully made movie and I would recommend seeing it.","true":true}
