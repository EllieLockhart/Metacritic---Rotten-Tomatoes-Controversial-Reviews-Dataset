The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game left a very bad feeling once I completed it. Let me first start off by saying this has nothing to do with the LGBTQ community since I did not mind\/care about the same sex relationship or the transgender references\/characters. What I did care about was the fact that the story just felt like nothing to me. From the beginning\\, once they announced a second game\\, I had a feeling Joel was going to die. It made sense\\, he had been around in the apocalypse for a long ass time\\, it was bound to happen eventually. Its important to be able to lose characters that you grow with\\, especially when it has the opportunity to pull out strong emotions from the audience. But this... This.. This was just too much. The fact that Joel gets smashed within the first few moments of the game was something\\, but the real issue I had with it was that he didnt get any honor to his death. No \\\"I love you Ellie\\\" or goodbyes\\, or anything. He is just gone\\, and after playing through him in the last game\\, growing with him over 7 years\\, and seeing him as the father figure he is. The developers felt it was okay to say bye bye. Which is just wrong.\r\rAs for Abby\\, I have not hated a character more than her. I think they could have done some good things with her\\, but the fact that I had to play as her for 10-15 hours of my gameplay\\, going through a story that I did not care about at all\\, and meeting characters I counted give a **** about and kind of wanted to kill right there\\, did not sit well with me. From the few times I would die as Abby\\, I laughed\\, because I cared that little for her character. I did not care for any of the main cast in her storyline\\, I did not care for the Scar children\\, and therefore as they all started to drop out one-by-one\\, I felt nothing. Nothing registered as they were killed because I did not feel anything towards the characters. The whole point of it was so that we can attempt to have some understanding and acceptance towards Abby\\, but that never came for me. (I'm not angry at her for killing Joel\\, just an f.y.i\\, like I said\\, him dying was not a bad part of the game)\r\rOh and don't get me started about Jessie's death. They just had to get him out of there to make it easier for Dina and Ellie to be together so he wouldn't be around with the baby. Removing a great character like that who is a strong character supporting the Asian community was just a rude idea. Laziest story writing ever.\r\rAll in all\\, this was a beautiful game. Design was 10\/10\\, Gameplay itself was 10\/10. It was the story and the characters which are the things that fell flat for me\\, and that is the biggest part of becoming attached to a game. You can make it look as pretty as you want\\, but you need more than graphics.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
