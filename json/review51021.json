Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely aweful movie. Went to see it with high expectations only to be utterly disgusted with the final product. In this movie storylines were not developed (still have no idea what Snokes backstory is and the explanation for reys parents is rediculous they are nobody important)\\, they killed Snoke in the most pitiful way and as we know with star wars u have to believe in the impossible but this movie went overboard(princess leiah being blown out a ship to fly like superman and luke being able to a prmake a projection of himself fighting kylo not mention all the weird cross planet conversation between kylo and rey. Unfortanetely this movie will be a succcess not because it is genuinely but it is another star wars movie for people to flock to. Save your time and moneyand dont see this piece of trash.","true":true}
