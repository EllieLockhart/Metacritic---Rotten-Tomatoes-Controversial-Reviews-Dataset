Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing better than ok. Some good moments but they're outweighed and overshadowed by silly\\, thoughtless ones. I hope JJ can redeem this seemingly unpopular trilogy in 9 and Rian performs better in his new trilogy.","true":true}
