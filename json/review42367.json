Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie turns the saga on its head and makes a stark commentary on the meaning of hope\\, the foundation of evil and the complexity of life. It fits and goes along with the universe's penchant for dark second chapters. See it\\, make your own decision. I loved it as much for what it was as I did for what it wasn't.","true":true}
