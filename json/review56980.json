Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie to date. Stop trying to grab my money every year\\, and put some actual effort behind your movies Disney. Do it quickly before you ruin a legacy\\, the world knows the quality that is supposed to come with a Star Wars movie\\, that came with George Lucas. If you continue to produce movies that are nothing more than a money grab with a convoluted story that amounts to nothing of consequence in the end the public will eventually catch on\\, and you will put yourselves out of business\\, this is why America is failing\\, people like you\\, and I? mean every single person who put their name on this movie and let this atrocity grace the screen \\nat theaters around the world. This lack of care and passion for what we have dedicated our lives to is where this system has failed\\, and where you have failed me.\\nSincerely\\,\\nPreviously a Star Wars fan","true":true}
