Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was 50\/50 on The Force Awakens\\, went into it with a clear mind\\, and am happy I did. This is Star Wars going in a new direction\\, and that's good. The movie was full of real characters full of emotion and development\\, which isn't always exaggerated\\, rather it is passed in the details. Tiptoes the line between the now and setting a canon and a future direction. And one last thing: steer clear from reviews saying \\\"Wasn't what I expected\/wanted\\\"\\, since they had made their minds before even going to the cinema.","true":true}
