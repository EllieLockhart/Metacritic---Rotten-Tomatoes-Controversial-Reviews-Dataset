Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable\\, complex\\, passionate\\, brilliant\\, flawed.\\n\\nDespite (and perhaps because) I entered the cinema with such low expectations for The Last Jedi\\, I was thoroughly blown away by the film's majesty. For one\\, cinematographically\\, The Last Jedi is beautiful. The camera work is visually compelling and invites one to sit deep in their seats\\, huddled with excitement and wonder. The score adds to this feeling exponentially.\\nWith humor only sometimes off-key\\, it's jokes let me relate and shake my head at the same time. Overall\\, The Last Jedis light-heartedness does not detract from the dark and propelling themes that follow it. There's a lot to be said\\, and done\\, and shown in the mere two hours we get\\, and they try. I cannot claim that the saga was given direction by this film\\, but it was certainly given depth and I fear for its ending because it deserves a good one.","true":true}
