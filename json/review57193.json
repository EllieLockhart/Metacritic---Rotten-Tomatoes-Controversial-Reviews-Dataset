Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Eight live-action films in 40 years\\, this is by far\\, the very worst. SPOLIER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! I dare say\\, watching Luke milk an alien\\, that's right\\, milk an alien\\, and then consume the fresh product there on the spot\\, made me nearly look back on poor ol' Jar Jar Binks\\, as if he were beloved an icon as James Dean! Just what the Sam Hill is going on here? This movie has so much wrong with it! So much! It's too long! Roughly two and a half hours. It tries too hard and too often to be funny. It causes seat-squirming not due to run time\\, but you begin to realize\\, that this is it. This isn't where the franchise stumbles\\, it's already done that\\, a few times. No\\, this is where this tale finally\\, and maybe inevitably takes the long hard fall it has been due for quite some time. This was bound to happen sooner or later. Look\\, I'm a huge fan of the director. I respect his previous achievents. Brick is one of my favorite films. These things are never guaranteed. I thought he had as good of shot\\, as anybody at getting this episode right. Unfortunately\\, he did not. I still think he could make great films\\, and win Oscars. I just hope he won't continue to carry this torch\\, though Disney has apparently green lit three more of this under his watch. I think it would be better to have different visions\\, interpretations of the next three from different filmmakers\\, maybe the director of woefully underrated Bladerunner 2049\\, or Neil Blomkamp? These might be good candidates. As far as this current film goes\\, it's difficult to love and care for the new generation of characters as one did in Eps IV-VI. I don't even find the relationship between Poe and BB-8 as sweet and endearing as Luke's and R2-D2's! And the human to human relationships here are just as unsatisfying or even believable. This movie jumped the shark\\, it nuked the fridge\\, and worst of all\\, it milked the alien!","true":true}
