Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing movie.\\nStory was poorly written\\, and lacked direction.\\nNo character development and too many plot holes.\\nIt tries to be cute and funny\\, which I personally took as some junior high humor.\\nToo many questions from this movie.\\nWhy spend all that time and effort to develop Snoke\\, only to have him die like a little bitc%? He was killed too easily for someone that had that much power over the force. There were so many theories on whom he was\\, and now we we will never know. For all we know he could be a Trump Staffer\\, or for Domino's Delivery boy.\\nWhy is it that Luke spent all his effort to convert his father back tot he light\\, who had been in the dark side of the force for decades\\, only to try and kill Ren without any effort to push him to the light? Too lame.\\nHow is it that Rey is able to do all those things\\, when Anakin and Luke Skywalker had to ensure training and they were incredibly strong in the force?\\nThere is too many other questions\\, which any Star Wars follower is simply going to shake his\/her head at.\\nThe fact that the wholes scenes of Finn's were a complete waste of time should not be lost. \\nThe ending was way too rushed. \\nAnyone who says the movie is good\\, probably also loves the Transformer movie  franchise as well.\\nHow this Rian Johnson got to write and direct this\\, can only mean that he has relatives in Disney or he did a lot of \\\"under the table work\\\". \\nI can understand that you want to get a new audience\\, but the studio did not follow any of the scripts that Lucas handed them. To kill the most iconic character in the Star Wars Franchise like this\\, is simply laughable. I had thought Luke would go out in some epic battle with Snoke and Ren\\, defending the Rebels\\, but instead he dies of force exhaustion?\\nSo the plan was to alienate the old hardcore Star Wars fans to HOPEFULLY bring in a younger audience....lol\\, smart move. \\nThis was the \\\"Last Jedi\\\"\\, and also my Last Star Wars movie. Very poor direction...","true":true}
