Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was everything I wanted it to be. I loved Luke's characterization\\, which was fresh and a little surprising but also\\, in hindsight\\, perfect. The new characters are as wonderful as before\\, with Rey as a standout. Also thrilling: Rose Tico and Amilyn Holdo. I can't wait to see what happens in movie 9.","true":true}
