It is really an amazing game and I still can\u2019t understand why people are **** it. There are a lot of gamers who are seeking realism in games. Then when they get it they just become furious cause their expectations were failed. Well\\, guess what\\, real life is tough and people make a lot of mistakes and stupid stuff in real life\\, too. Life is not just black and white. We often do something according to our emotions not logic\\, cause we\u2019re just humans afterall. It\u2019s obviously really sad that Joel died but life is always that way: we often face consequences based on our actions. We can mean the whole world for ones and be hated by others and this game is a perfect example of showing us this real life complexity. It\u2019s really sad that most people hate The Last of Us 2 just because they want a happy ending. I am personally in love of how the Naughty Dog showed us the complexity of hate\\, love\\, loss and forgiveness. Really depressing but deep story of mistakes we often made. Thanks to all the people who worked on this game\\, it was really a hard work. One of the best games for me so far.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
