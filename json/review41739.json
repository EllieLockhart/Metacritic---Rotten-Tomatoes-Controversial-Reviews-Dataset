Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't perfect but it makes up for a convoluted plot with characters I truly liked & visually it's just mind blowing in every way. I enjoyed it and so did my kids. It got a little bogged down in the middle but the beginning and ending battle scenes were amazing. This was obviously a movie that sacrificed character exploration to be more visual in order to make this for the masses. I think the movie succeeds in being beautifully futuristic looking & entertains at a high level. Nostalgic and still hopeful & forward looking.","true":true}
