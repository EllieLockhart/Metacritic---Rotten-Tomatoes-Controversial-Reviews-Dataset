Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite possibly the worst Star Wars of the series. The aboslute worst thing is the script\\, it reads like a bad fanfiction you could get from fanfiction.net\\, multiple mary sue characters\\, plot holes galore\\, bad jokes obviously stolen from comedian's that could tell them better. (There was even a your mama joke... really?) Visually\\, the film is the best in the series\\, but the bad scripts just kill your suspension of disbelief so hard\\, you either want to take a nap or walk out by the time you'r on the casino planet sub-plot line. \\n\\nAnyways\\, I'm done with Star Wars. Disney obviously doesn't care and have mismanaged this priceless property to a bargain bin level of quality. Feels like a slap in the face that they still treat this property as a timeless classic while simultaneously destroying every aspect that made the series timeless in the first place.","true":true}
