Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very poorly scripted\\, nihilistic\\, characters wasted\\, rehash of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi moments\\, virtually a parody of Star Wars\\, and surprisingly anti-male. They really have no good idea what to do with this new series other than repeat what's been done before\\, and sh*t on the rest. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is no better than some shit*y Transformers movie that is just a bunch of scenes stuck together\\, and tons of plot contrivances that make absolutely no sense. Just horribly lazy writing.\\n\\nRey really is a Mary Sue character that has no flaws and is out of the box perfect. Boring and unrealistic. Finn is totally wasted in this\\, when he had a somewhat good beginning in The Force Awakens. Leia does basically nothing. Luke... don't get me started... \\n\\nThis film somehow managed to make The Force Awakens even worse. It's like Rian Johnson saw The Force Awakens and the original trilogy and was like\\, \\\"Nah\\, I want to do MY thing...\\\" \\n\\nThere are plenty of existing reviews out there\\, and in here\\, explaining directly and in detail what is wrong with this film. They are correct. Just got to YouTube and search \\\"Last Jedi Sucks\\\" for far more entertaining takes on this than the actual film itself.\\n\\nEssentially the Star Wars saga is the original trilogy and the prequels. That's it. This \\\"new\\\" trilogy is just well produced but poorly written\\, \\\"fan\\\" fiction. \\n\\nAt this point\\, I have zero interest in seeing Episode 9.","true":true}
