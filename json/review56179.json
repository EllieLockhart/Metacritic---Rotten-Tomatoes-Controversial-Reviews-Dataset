Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They've disrespected a heritage and storyline with cheap political ideological scenes cuckolding former heros in favour of strong decisive women.   Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson have taken a rich vibrant and deep cinematic world and turned it into a cheap\\, tacky and shallow soap opera.    Total disappointment and indicative of the crap churned out by companies like Disney nowadays.   You failed.","true":true}
