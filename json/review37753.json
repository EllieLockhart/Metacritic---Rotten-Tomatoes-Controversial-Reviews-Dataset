Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There was some quirkiness to the movie and Mark has certainly matured as an artist since his first go round as LS\\, but after delaying seeing the film for the first time until last night\\, I like it and I'm going to go see it again\\, very soon.","true":true}
