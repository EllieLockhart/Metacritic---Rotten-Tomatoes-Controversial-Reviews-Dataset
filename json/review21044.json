Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was ready for this movie to fix the holes and missteps from The Force Awakens. I was ready for this movie to bring closure to several questions that needed answering: who is Snoke and what is his purpose? How did the First Order grow after the defeat of the Empire? How does Rey tie into all of this? Why did Luke seemingly break from his morals and spirit to die alone? Instead\\, I was greeted with Johnson and Disney's new direction. Its as if they gave up on the first entry of this saga\\, and on Star Wars in general. The film took risks and went against expectations. While I respect unconventional film making\\, I think it is fair to criticize introducing new elements into a well established franchise this late into the series. Like Mr. Hamill\\, I disagree entirely with Luke's storyline; it doesn't fit his character in the slightest. Finn has become even more irrelevant than he was in the first film\\, and Rose\\, while enjoyable\\, is pointless. I could go on\\, but to put it simply I hope they manage to remedy this mess. There are too many gaps that need filling\\, and such a monumental saga should not go down with grand spectacle\\, but mediocre story.","true":true}
