Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The did a great dishonor to the fans. Rose is a pointless character\\,  the coder is a useless character\\, and the political overtones in the Casino arc are very annoying (the first order is literally only white men - the main audience for this movie\\, Rose and Fin and Admiral Purple hair are just token characters without depth). The humor in this film is out of place in a film where the good side is being annihilated. Next Rey is continues to be a Mary Sue\\, with 0 training is a better than a literal vergence in the force (Anikin). Finally\\, the use of hyperspace as a weapon doesn't make sense in light of how the technology is treated in the rest of the star wars universe. \\n\\nThe only cool part of the movie is the dark side cave scene\\, the appearance of yoda\\, the mind link between Rey and Kylo\\, and the fight with the praetorian guard.","true":true}
