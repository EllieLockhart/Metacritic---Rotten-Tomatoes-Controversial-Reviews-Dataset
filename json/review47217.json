Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an utterly disappointing movie. Being surprising for no reason isn't authenticate or even interesting; it just plain sucks. The world is at your disposal in terms of plot and we get a slow motion death like something out of Austin Powers. And the movie straight up insults fan intelligence by assuming we aren't going to ask the question\\, \\\"So why didn't Holdo just tell Poe her plan?\\\"\\, removing the entirety of the sub-plot. If a sub-plot is dismantled that easily should it really make it into the movie?\\n\\nGood luck wrapping this up in one episode. The best bet would be to disregard and redo this movie correctly and then finish the series properly. Goddammit I'm disappointed. Goddammit.","true":true}
