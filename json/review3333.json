Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Being a major Star Wars fan\\, and in fact being named after the main character from Star Wars\\, I was really hoping to like this movie and was very excited to see it. After leaving the theater I resigned to the fact that I will never see another Star Wars movie again. Terrible acting\\, major plot holes\\, pointless humor\\, and zero direction. It was such a painful movie going experience that I ended up missing key plot twists because I was either distracted by juvenile humor and terrible acting\\, or I simply just didn't care. I would love to discuss this with one of the hundreds of film critics who gave it positive reviews\\, because I believe they were viewing this movie through a rose colored lens\\, not a critical thinking one. It is hard to ignore the glaring plot holes\\, nay\\, I would say impossible!","true":true}
