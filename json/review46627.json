Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too go Disney\\,  Ruined Star wars. Only episode's 1 though 6 exist In my book. Keep on killing off the main characters we love. If it wasn't for that it be an ok sequel. In the it's Dog shit!","true":true}
