Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Just terrible. While I am a Star Wars fan\\, my problems with this film are not related to that fact. I do hate to see what they've done to the world of Star Wars\\, but even as a standalone movie\\, this is an illogical and horribly written story. The characters are not well developed\\, there are too many attempts at humor\\, all of which are unfunny and misplaced\\, taking away from the emotional impact of those respective scenes. Each attempt at humor was like someone stopped the movie\\, told a bad joke\\, and then resumed playing it. Scenes meant to elicit fear\\, concern\\, danger\\, were trumped by the inclusion of such comedic stumbles.\\n\\nThe universe of Star Wars also causes conflicts\\, since this story doesn't match up with the other films we've seen as part of this world. In other words\\, there is a major failure in the continuity department. Be it the ships and technology that are less advanced than those of the prior films\\, or the Force powers that never existed prior to this mess\\, I can't understand how these ideas found their way into such a well-established cinematic universe. It's also important to note that there are substantial contradictions or continuity errors with the newest film as well\\, and not just the original trilogy. The Force Awakens presented a lot of new ideas and stories to build upon\\, but this heap of nonsense completely ignored those ripe stories. The theme of the film\\, which was explicitly stated by Kylo Ren within it\\, is that he past must die. This film and its creators don't hide that message\\, and it was clearly some misguided attempt to reset the universe and clean house\\, under the guise of \\\"subverting expectations.\\\" That is the moronic theme that others have claimed to be some genius message. They didn't subvert expectations\\, other than the fact that we expected a good movie and an interesting Star Wars story\\, only to have this instead. It is anything but those things.\\n\\nOverall\\, I'd give it a .5 out of 5 stars for the aforementioned reasons (and because ZERO isn't an option)\\, as well as the other failures I don't have time to list at the moment. I will continue to watch the original films and I will treat them as a closed story. As far as I'm concerned\\, this film is NOT a part of the Star Wars saga\\, and I don't expect the sequel to fit in either. If you haven't seen this movie\\, consider yourself lucky\\, and stay FAR\\, FAR AWAY.","true":true}
