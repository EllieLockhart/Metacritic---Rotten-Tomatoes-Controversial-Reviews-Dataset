Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dark and refreshing continuation of the Star Wars saga- offering a plethora of surprises and reveals. This is definitely one of the most cathartic films in the saga with Adam Driver's Kylo Ren being the centre of it. However\\, the tonal inconsistencies hold this film back from being a masterpiece; this film still has the makings of a modern classic. Watch it if you haven't already.","true":true}
