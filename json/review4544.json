Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematography and musically it's superb.\\nEverything else is an abomination and an insult to fans and casual moviegoers. They've taken established lore\\, cherished characters (which are unrecognizable and may as well have been playing different roles) massive plot holes and takes major plot threads from the Last movie and literally bins them\\n. Absolutely hated it","true":true}
