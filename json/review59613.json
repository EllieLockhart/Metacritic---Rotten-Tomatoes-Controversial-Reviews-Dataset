We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Years of Waiting for this...\rThe Graphics are Realy Beautiful this is why i gave 1 Point but the Story.... lets begin with the Start.\rFirst of\\, killing a Friend or Mentor\\, Family member at the start of the Game is one of the laziest and most uncreative ways to start a Story that could have gone in so many Directions that the First game made open at the end but ok\\, it worked. I hated that Character so much that it kept me going. It had good moments and the \\\"flashback\\\" parts where realy good and made me Love the Joel&Ellie relationship even more wich also resulted in hating Abby even more. Killing her Friends was not satisfying enough but was a good start. So far so good\\, but then it started to get ridiculous.\rWhat the HELL did you think you where doing Naughty Dog ?!?\rYou forced us to Play as Abby ? The one Character we wanted to kill on the most Brutal and sadistic way that would be possible without the game getting Banned!?! You wanted to make us have feelings about her and her Friends ? You wanted to make us feel sorry for her and her dumb father ? You wanted to Justify her actions and thought that we would think that she had the right to kill Joel ? Yeah\\, guess what ? IT DID NOT WORK! All that it did was wanting her even more dead. I gave and give a damn **** about her feelings her friends and her damn father all i want is too f***ing kill her! There was absolutely not even a little bit of room for empathy or feelings towards this f***ing piece of sh** called Abby. Then the second part did end and you made us fight against Ellie... i realy don`t know what you did think to yourself while your where writing and develop the second part of the game... and then you let it end there with everyone going there ways and the second part ends. At that time i realy thought this would be it\\, this is how it ends. But no\\, you made us Hope that we would get what we where all waiting for throughout the entire Game. Once more we are going out to seek Abby and leave everything behind us to finally Kill that piece of sh**. And than what ? Right\\, wen don`t get it. The game ends and Abby is still alive... Did you realy thought that what was happening to Abby at the end of the game would make us Happy enough ? That we think that she suffered enough ? Pathetic.... All that we wanted was to f***ing Kill her\\, too slaughter her\\, too make die a slow and Painful way but you\\, Naughty Dog\\, did not give us that satisfaction\\, you did not give us Justice. You did not Deliver! Another Franchise is Ruined\\, another once so good Developer is gone. All that you did with this game\\, Naughty Dog\\, is that you will go Down like all the other developers that did not Deliver and let their Fans down. Naughty Dog you are just a huge disappointment....\u2026 Expand","true":true}
