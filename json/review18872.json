Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s apparent Jar Jar Binks wrote and directed this move. Throw everything \u201cimportant\u201d from the Force Awakens away and enjoy a made for TV movie on the big screen. Only thing good about the movie was the score ","true":true}
