Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst of all the Star Wars films.  Lame casino scene\\, lame Luke story\\, no depth is added to Rey when there could have been\\, the movie feels drawn out\\, and I have no attachment at the end\\, no real questions or curiosity about the last film in the biggest movie franchise of all time.  Thats how bad RJ fudged this movie up.","true":true}
