And seeing the hell that Joel and Ali went through I was really hoping this game would measure a but instead all I got was a overly politicized game and that's absolutely hates man they kill all the men off pushes degeneracy as normality.  And instead of a story.  I get a mass.  If I could sum up the last of the sport to story in a few words it would be just plain evil to the point of say tannic levels.  They're trying to push realism while a young girl kills hundreds of people that's what they're telling you that.  In reality it's not about realism it's about pushing a political Meredith.  A perception of reality that does not exist.  I'm fully aware that this game had a feminist working on a multiple feminists actually except the feminist movement has been turned into a communist movement I'm a big student of history as well I know what the communists did to the feminist after they took over Russia they shot them in the head.  This game has a beautiful soundtrack incredible graphics for the PlayStation for but it is one of the most evil sick perverted degenerate games I've ever played in my entire life.  This is not a game it is what the feminists wanna do to all men kill 'em all.  There is no story here worth listening to.  Those of us who are giving this game low scores understand we are not review bombing it were just telling you the honest truth.  The last of  part 2 gets a zero from me for being one of the most repulsive evil perverted games I have ever seen in my life I would call this thing a piece of s***    but you can actually grow something with that.  There's absolutely nothing good about this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
