Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial thought was after I got out of the theater was it was okay\\, but not great.  But as I sat around reflecting on what I saw\\, I could not help but wonder why they made the film at all.  It is a complete slap in the face to the fans of Star Wars.  Especially the fans of the original Star Wars.  What was the upside to having Luke look like a crazy hermit drinking milk from some space alien?  I am still lost at how anyone thought that was funny.  Further\\, where was the storytelling?  This was a hot button for a lot of people with the Prequels was that the storytelling just wasn't there.  And now we have a new batch of Star Wars movies coming down the pipeline and no storytelling whatsoever.  I think someone has lost touch with what Star Wars is all about.  This was a mess from start to finish.  It had some interesting action scenes but mostly the plot fell short.  Also when you make a Trilogy you might want to have the all tie together somehow.  The Last Jedi undid just about everything The Force Awakens set up.  Where is the direction for this Trilogy?  Was it just to piss off the fans.  I don't get it...I'll put it another way\\, if this film was not made\\, I would not know the difference.","true":true}
