Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disjointed mess. A few interesting ideas which\\, much like the characters\\, are not allowed to develop or interact with one another and are ultimately frustrated. Moments that are laughable for the wrong reasons\\, and others very rightly infuriating. Adam Driver's Kylo Wren a surprising bright side. Otherwise\\, frequent repetitions of tired tropes\\, editing that leaves you weaving between incompatible tones and half-baked secondary storylines\\, and many many missed opportunities","true":true}
