Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the humor.  My son leaned in and said it might be a little too funny\\, but it tapers off and evens out in the middle.  Very intense.  I don't remember feeling so much excitement and intensity in a Star Wars film as I have in this episode.  MY opinion\\, it is better than TFA and Rogue One.  Rogue one pay-off was the darth vader scene at the end. THis one has several stellar moments. It's in a galaxy far away\\, but it resonated at home with me. Emotional\\, humorous and action packed.  And yes\\, Luke has aged and is different from the Luke we are used to.  Nor am I the same person i was 20 years ago. . .","true":true}
