Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not believe most of these critics. It's easy to see who are not true Star Wars fans. This movie had so many plot holes and discrepancies that you can tell it was poorly written. It seems to be written and made in a way to purposely let down the fans by giving them a big middle finger! I used to like Rian Johnson but\\, after seeing this I would be very wary with the new trilogy he is slated to make. For sure\\, it will not be made to satisfy the true fans. After seeing this film\\, the build ups prior to this became let downs and legends were merely nothing. As a fan for the last 40 years\\, this movie was a message of total disrespect which left a hole in my heart that I think I will not recover from. The saga to  me \\, completely died after this film.","true":true}
