Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything in this movie makes little to no sense I'm not going to spoil it but be warned\\, if you want to see good sci-fi this is not it. Every moment feels like \\\"because a wizard did it!\\\" Or \\\"Because I a gal I'm right\\\" it's getting old and we really need to stop this kind of story telling. A magic system needs to be well thought out and have clear boundaries otherwise that makes a story less compelling. This whole movie says flip good writing and I am sad to see Star Wars go even further down this path.","true":true}
