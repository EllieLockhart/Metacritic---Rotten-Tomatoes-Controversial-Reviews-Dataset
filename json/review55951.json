Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson shines with his latest movie \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\".\\nAfter the Base of the Resistance is being attacked our Heros have to escape. But what they dont know: they can't hide from the evil \\\"First Order\\\"\\, led by Supreme Leader Snoke.\\n\\nMeanwhile Rey has found Luke Skywalker\\, but he refuses to help the last remainder of the Resistance. On the other side of the force Kylo Ren is being hectored by the Supreme Leader. Through a connection\\, powered by the force\\, Rey and Kylo discuss the future of the galaxy and realize that they do not feel pure hate for each other. Great dialogues and intriguing twists and great performances\\, especially from Adam Driver\\, really highlights this movie.\\n\\nThe weakest part of the movie is the subplot with Finn (John Boyega) and the new character Rose\\, with cheesy dialogue and and unsatisfying conclusion. However they meet another Character\\, played by (Benicio Del Toro) with big potential for the Star Wars 9.\\n\\nPoe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes rouge after disagreeing with the leaders of the Resistance.\\n\\nAnd most imprtantly: We finally get to see the heart-warming scene with Leia and Luke\\, we were waiting for in Star Wars 7!","true":true}
