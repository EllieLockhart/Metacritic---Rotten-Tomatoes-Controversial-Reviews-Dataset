Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They took a big risk and In my eyes it worked really well\\, all the little bitches saying that it's bad are just holding onto the past to much things need to change or we will just have a repeat of force awakens\\, I thought the comedy was good other than it seemed out of place a couple of times\\, which is what most people seem to find annoying. But there was just too many epic moments to mention I was shaking through my seat with mixes of emotions not knowing what was going to happen\\, very satisfied","true":true}
