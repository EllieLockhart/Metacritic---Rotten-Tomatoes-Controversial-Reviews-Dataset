Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One word - Consistency. Disney\\, Rian Johnson and anybody involved with this nonsense of a film should look it up. I don't care if you want to make Luke a depressed grump\\, throw the Jedi\/Sith concepts in the trash and totally disregard all plot and character points from the previous film in the series. It's stupid but if that's what you want to do then fine. As long as these drastic changes have reasons behind them and as long as those reasons are *consistent* with the existing story\\, plot and characters then it's all good. If you pivot everything toward these ridiculous (and boring) new plot points and character personalities while giving reasons that are *also inconsistent* with the established story thread\\, then you're just being flat out lazy. It's basic story telling.","true":true}
