Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was extremely disappointed with the movie. Many scenes were clearly not thought out\\, leaving many holes in the story line. Comedic relief was not used properly\\, creating many awkward moments while watching the movie. You could tell that the director expected you to think these points in the movie were funny or clever\\, but his sense of humor in definitely different than mine... and everyone else's. WORST STAR WARS FILM IN FRANCHISE!!!","true":true}
