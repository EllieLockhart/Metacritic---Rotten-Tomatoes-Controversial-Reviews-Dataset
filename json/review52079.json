Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing it twice\\, I definitely would put this in my top 5 Star Wars films. Like in Empire\\, things look pretty grim for our rebels\\, but the humor balances out the darkness. The characters from TFA are all excellent again\\, and it's fun to watch them develop and learn from their mistakes. I definitely want a Porg and a BB unit now\\, so I'm definitely a sucker for their merchandising. I've spent the last few days discussing the characters and character motivations as well as the various themes explored throughout the film. I love films that inspire such rousing discussion.","true":true}
