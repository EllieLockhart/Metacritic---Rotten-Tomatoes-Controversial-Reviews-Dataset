Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is fun and full of incredible sci-fi moments but the lack of any narrative pay-off\\, an unneeded subplot\\, and an absolutely lazy third act makes the film a disappointment. It's a slap in the face to vested fans\\, who were expecting a deeper exploration of franchise lore\\, some measure of shock or gravitas\\, or a more cohesive narrative. The Empire Strikes Back is several decades old yet still feels more original and memorable than this recent mess of a film.","true":true}
