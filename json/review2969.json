Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"bad cinematography\\, bad characterization\\, and a lot of strange moments that weren't well enacted\\, and if these were Comedy these were Not well-executed and were just disturbing sometimes. Combat was rushed and over-the-top\\, effects were good yet Unfocused\\, and just basically became a movie about flailing your light-saber around and killing all the bad guys. Stream it if it's on your already-paid-for subscription and don't waste your money in theaters or dvd unless you're trying for a blue-ray collection... but just wait until 9 is released as it will be cheaper and your collection isn't complete until that movie anyway.","true":true}
