Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was an insult to the Star Wars Universe and its philosophy\\, and of course to the fans. What a shame\\, all those resources were wasted on such a horrible movie. Even the prequels are more original and consistent than this garbage. We took George Lucas for granted\\, and now that he's gone\\, all we have is Disney's horrible vision of Star Wars\\, which is all about making easy money.","true":true}
