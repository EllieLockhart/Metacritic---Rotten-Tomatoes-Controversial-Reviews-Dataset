Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm completely confused by all of the negativity surrounding this movie. The Last Jedi was an incredible installment of the Star Wars saga. The acting was excellent\\, the cinematography was stunning\\, and the writing was perhaps the most daring and original of any Star Wars film yet. I've been a lifelong Star Wars fan and not only does this movie do justice to the Star Wars universe\\, it was everything I hoped for and more.","true":true}
