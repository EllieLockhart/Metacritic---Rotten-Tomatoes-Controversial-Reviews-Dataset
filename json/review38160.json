Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The things I liked about the movie\\, I loved. The things I didn't like? I hated. There are many problems with the film from disjointed storytelling to outright character problems. Two movies into the new trilogy and I still like the idea of the characters better than the execution of them. Finn\\, while likable\\, has the almost exact same character arc as he did in The Force Awakens. He tries to run away and ultimately realizes he needs to stand up and save others. Will he ever learn his lesson? That's just one of many examples. The handling of Luke Skywalker was abysmal and Mark Hamill\\, bless him\\, does the best he can with it. Even with the issues I had with the film I was on the fence until the end of the film. Luke and Leia have a reunion that leads to character assassination for both of the characters. Neither one of them would give up on anyone else\\, let alone family. It isn't a bad film so much as it is incredibly disappointing. The Force Awakens\\, for all of its faults\\, is a much better film.","true":true}
