Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really despise this movie.  As someone who grew up with the original trilogy and got to see the prequels as a kid\\,  I have a deep love for the former\\, and i enjoy the good parts of the prequels for what they are.  \\nThese movies all stayed true to their characters.  The force awakens did not\\, and it bothered me during that movie.  But it ruined this one.  Honestly\\, Luke is disgraceful here.  The mere fact that he would kill his nephew\\, Han and Leia's child in his sleep\\, for even a moment\\, is simply ridiculous.  The man that saw good in Darth Vader and redeemed him?  That alone was enough to ruin the movie\\, not to mention the Merry Poppins flight\\, ackbars death\\, the complete waste of Snoke as a character\\, Admiral Holdos terrible leadership and writing\\, the milk scene...  There are a million things I hate about this movie\\, and every time something interesting happens it's immediately followed by something ruining the moment.  I love Star Wars\\, But I absolutely hate this movie.","true":true}
