Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We saw The Last Jedi - Christmas Day. Unfortunately after sitting through 2.5 hours of great visuals yet frustraingly bad writing & directing we walked out and all immediately agreed this movie was not just a bad Star Wars movie. It is a terrible movie period. 6 story lines to follow including many new characters who are so poorly developed you wonder if they are just introduced so that Disney cannot get held up by the \\\"stars\\\" of the movie.","true":true}
