Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nonsensical plot-lines\\, unexplained character actions and reactions and universe-defying \\\"new science\\\" make for a sloppy\\, \\\"worst-yet\\\" Star Wars installment. Calling this story a bold move is about as generous a description as could possibly be merited. The film offers absolutely nothing in the way of character arch and ignores every speck of groundwork laid in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". When stripped of its entertaining visuals and underlying nostalgia\\, this film is nothing short of a complete disaster.","true":true}
