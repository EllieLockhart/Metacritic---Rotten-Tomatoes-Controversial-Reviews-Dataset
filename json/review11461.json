Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie\\, easily worst since the \\\" The Phantom Menace\\\". Took huge\\, very important characters and gave them meaningless deaths and did the same with new characters without any background. Didnt follow the  Parallels  all the Star Wars' plots have followed the entire Saga. Just ruined the whole thing. And then to polish it off\\, the fight scenes\\, which make starwars starwars\\, were auful\\, the character development SUCKED\\, and 50% of the movie was uneeded corny scenes that had nothing to do with the plot. It just seems like they added a bunch of crap in to make it longer or something. THIS STARWARS IN A NUTSHELL -> I was blown away by how awful it was in the end that I wasnt sure what to do. I just sat there and thought \\\"did I just waste 2.5 hours watching something that will ruin my opinion of star wars forever??\\\" It was horrible","true":true}
