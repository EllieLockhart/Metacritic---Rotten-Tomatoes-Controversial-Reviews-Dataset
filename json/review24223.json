Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"meh\\, it was ok. Not terrible\\, not great. No big reveals\\, matter of fact secrets in TFA are revealed to be not meaningful or mediocre. Was glad to see Luke back but not sure where this franchise is heading in the future. There is no nostalgia to hang onto for the next film.","true":true}
