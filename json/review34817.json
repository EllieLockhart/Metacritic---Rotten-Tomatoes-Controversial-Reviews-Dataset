Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The effects are good\\, and the music is good.   Unfortunately that is about it.  This is another SJW movie that apparently hates straight white men.  Guys\\, diversity is fine\\, but just don't cram it down everyones throat.    The good news is that this movie killed my desire to see the next one.  That is saying a lot\\, given that even Jar Jar couldn't do that.","true":true}
