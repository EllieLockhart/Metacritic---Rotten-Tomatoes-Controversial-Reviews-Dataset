Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, this is my first time ever writing a review. No\\, I don't think it's suspicious. \\n\\nThat's because I've never before been so let down by a movie that I felt the need to go on a website and spend actual time typing out a message to the public about how much this movie was hot garbage. I see a lot of websites saying there's a suspicious amount of first-time reviewers\\, but here I am telling you it's because this movie was so bad that it has spurred a brand new generation of movie reviewers. What an everlasting impact.\\n\\nIn the first 5-10 minutes\\, I literally thought they were doing one of those Disney mini-movies that was a satire on the whole series because of how forced and ham-fisted the writing was. The characters were just caricatures of themselves. You can practically replace every villain's lines with \\\"I am so heinously evil\\, please hand me a puppy so that I may do unspeakable things to it mwahaha\\\" and it wouldn't have made a difference.\\n\\nI want to note that I'm looking at this movie through the lens of someone who isn't a \\\"Star Wars fan\\\". I like Star Wars\\, sure\\, but I have no memorabilia or scale models or Imperial logo shirts. \\n\\nThis movie\\, as a movie\\, was bad. I'm sure there are many more conversations about the canon and the continuation of the saga\\, but I'm here to say that performing at it's most basic requirements of being a movie\\, it didn't deliver. The actors felt plastic\\, the dialogue felt forced\\, the humor out-of-place\\, and nearly every situation cliched and predictable. A couple of the unpredictable moments were so atrociously obnoxious that I had wished they replaced it with something predictable instead. \\n\\nQuite a letdown\\, especially after the beautiful movie that was Rogue One. A movie is\\, first a foremost\\, a story about people. I didn't care about The Last Jedi's people whatsoever.","true":true}
