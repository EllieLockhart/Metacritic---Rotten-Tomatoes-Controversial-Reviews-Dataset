Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolutely incredible. I know many fans feel this was not like a normal Star Wars movie\\, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s so much more. It was a but long for me but I still thoroughly enjoyed every second of watching it. I highly recommend that people see this movie with an open mind. ","true":true}
