Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had great visuals and sound. But the plot was loose and sloppy. I didn't care about the casino planet and felt that entire thing could have been skipped. There are numerous other plot holes and I do not know why all of the threads left in Episode 7 was left or just snipped without any kind of attempted conclusion. Is anyone actually writing a coherent plotline between all three movies?  It really didn't feel like it is. And I would really love for Disney to retract or uncanonize this movie and while it is a massive ask for them to produce a new movie to fill its spot.","true":true}
