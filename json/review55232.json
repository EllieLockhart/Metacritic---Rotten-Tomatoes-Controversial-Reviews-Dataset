Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just like Empire\\, this movie is suffering from first impression bad reactions\\, this time from fans\\, that time from critics\\, and it will grow over time to be one of the most beloved. \\n\\nIt's a truly beautiful movie\\, it takes many risks and chances\\, it's unexpected\\, subversive and powerful. \\nIt has a very different feeling than other Star Wars movie.\\nYou can see the hand of Rian Johnson all over it\\, which is probably one of the reasons why many fans are disliking it or criticizing it so much.\\nThere were some expectations that fans (and me as well) had\\, which didn't turn out the way we thought\\, and this is another reason for the bad reactions.\\nThe issue I have with this is that fans criticized TFA for being too similar to ANH and not taking chances\\, and now they are cticizing TLJ for the exact opposite reason\\, because it doesn't show what they wanted to show\\, it takes too many risks and isn't predictable.\\n\\nPeople should see this movie multiple times and let all this new lore and information sink in. \\nThe first reactions will not be entirely good\\, because this movie is slower paced than many previous ones\\, it's longer and a bit weird. \\nBut if you see it a second time\\, or even a third\\, you will notice the exceptional acting\\, the greatly written dialogue\\, the great character development\\, especially for certain characters like Rey\\, Kylo and Poe\\, the amazing cinematography\\, directing\\, sound design\\, music (better than in TFA)\\, and the interesting development of the lore and mythology surrounding the very nature of the Force\\, the Jedi and their mistakes.\\n\\nThis movie is awesome.","true":true}
