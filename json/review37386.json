Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem isn't with multi-culturalism or woman characters- the problem is with a garbage movie and a political narrative and agenda being shoved down your throat.  I wouldn't want it from the right or the left.. I just wanted to go see a Star Wars movie in a galaxy far far away.  Far away from the political garbage that this country goes through on a daily basis.  I wanted an escape that I loved as a child and still love as an adult. Thank you for your bias\\, i will no longer be seeing you.","true":true}
