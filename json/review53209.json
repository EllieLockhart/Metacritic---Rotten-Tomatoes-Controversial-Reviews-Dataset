Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars yet!  \\n\\nYes\\, I said it.  And I'm old enough to have seen them all in theaters.  \\n\\nCertainly deserves some Oscar bids.

Still recovering from the emotional roller coaster.\\n\\nKyle Ren is everything I believe Lucus wanted in Vader but he didn't have the script or the actor to pull it off in the prequels.\\n\\nAnd Luke....wow\\, I didn't realize that Mark Hamill was actually a good actor until last night.","true":true}
