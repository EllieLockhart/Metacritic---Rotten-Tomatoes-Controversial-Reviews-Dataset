Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's OK. It's more than OK. It's as exciting as a theme park ride but with more twists and turns than a regular roller coaster. Is that what a Pirates of the Caribbean ride ara Disney park is like?\\nWatching the movie itself was not unlike an experience of watching an outrageous Bollywood epic. However\\, in the theatre i was in\\, the only scene in which the audience whooped and cheered and laughed together was that brushing dust off the shoulder scene. Otherwise it was pretty muted. Tough crowd\\, but they sure loved the hammed up pantomime like scenes.\\n\\nPerhaps\\, the entire story and plotline itself is pretty grim.","true":true}
