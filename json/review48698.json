Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie ever! Movie is called the last Jedi jet poe get the same screentime as luke and rey. Finn travels to a planet is doing nothing there than comes back doing nothing. Rey is not getting trained by luke. She has just one fight were she is stronger than everybody in the universe besides snoke. Snoke got killed by kylo like snoke has no power at all. Kylo just screams and crys. He is now the villain of the villains. Lets compare him to the imperor. Or to darth vader or to darth maul or to count doku or general grivous...in my opinion not comparebal...he is not scary or evil enough. Rose totally bullshit. Lukes hole scenes are disrespectfull. The showed him as a complete loser. Thx rian jonson. Please stop doing movies.","true":true}
