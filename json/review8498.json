Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finn and Asian chick which i forgot name about cuz was irrelevant should never be together they only know each other for 2 hours. Characters didn't feel the same\\, there was no character to development. To many jokes made me bored. Sorry for bad writing but it's not worth to go so in dept for this shitty movie","true":true}
