Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's well made unlike the final chapter but boring characters\\, unexplained levels of power\\, the worst fall of a hero ever\\, weak enemies all make this movie sad and pointless. Rey strolls to victory and never feels under pressure. A continuation from.the last 15 mins of the previous movie. The film that almost destroyed Star Wars\\, not because it was badly put together or edited\\, but because it feels like it is trying to annoy fans of the originals\\, rather than keep them on board while bringing younger people on too.\\nShould be re edited with extra shots of Rey training with Luke not a total loser.","true":true}
