Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More like prequels\\, less like the original trilogy! Story seems inconsequential and most of the time forgets it's sequel to force awakens. Humor doesn't work and breaks the flow of the movie. But the most disappointing part of this movie is missed potential. It's a movie but not the movie that everybody expects from star wars!","true":true}
