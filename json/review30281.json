Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Say what you want...I liked it quite a bit.  It was bold\\, daring\\, dark\\, and interesting.  Fun at times...and exciting at times.  Overall...I was cool with it.  Yeah it had a solid lull in the middle.  However loved the exploration of \\\" Rey & Kylo \\\". Good stuff.","true":true}
