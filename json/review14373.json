Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had an emotional reaction to several of the scenes\\, and I initially walked away liking a lot of the film.. but overall I feel they did a poor job of building on the momentum from TFA. This is a terrible closure to Luke's overall arc. Doesn't feel like he would ever behave as he did in this movie. Also ALL the jokes are terrible. Cringe-worthy. Boooring side plots that add nothing interesting overall and take you away from things you care about. They also totally wasted Snoke\\, could have been a great villain instead he was shallow as pointless as any other CGI monster in a big budget flick. It's depressing to hear that this guy is gonna direct 4 more Star Wars movies now... they need to bring JJ back.","true":true}
