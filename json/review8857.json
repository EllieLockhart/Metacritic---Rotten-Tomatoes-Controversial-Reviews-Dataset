Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For some people\\, the prequels ruined the series. I can understand that. Some how I was able to look past the cheese and appreciate the awesome effects that hazily told the backstory of every Star Wars fan's favorite villain\\, Darth Vader. The Force Awakens didn't blow me away but I enjoyed it and it left a lot for fans to look forward to. This movie\\, The Last Jedi\\, has entirely ruined Star Wars for me and what looks like to be many others too. Plot lines are unimaginative and ultimately worthless to the plot. The plot twists are AWFUL. The greatest characters\\, old and new\\, die or get killed off in completely unsatisfying manners. I left the theater feeling sick. It may not be an awful movie by itself but as a whole it completely ruins star wars. This movie leaves nothing to look forward to and I'm not interested in finding out any answers to the questions that are left. I'm also disappointed with rotten tomatoes. They gave such a high score to this film. It honestly looks like they were paid off. This film will disappoint any true fan of the series.","true":true}
