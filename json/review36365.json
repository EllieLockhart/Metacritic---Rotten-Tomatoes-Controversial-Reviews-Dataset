Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think about the film\\, the more I realize what a horrible film it was.  Storyline does not flow consistently. Dialogue was pitiful even cringey.  Yes there is a lot of action but with little to no substance.  Basically\\, it is an attempt at killing off all the main characters from the originals and my only shock is that they didn't go ahead and kill Chewbacca off in the process. I will not rewatch.  I will not buy the DVD. At this point\\, not sure if I will watch Episode 9 because this movie sucked all the enthusiasm and magic of Star Wars out of me.","true":true}
