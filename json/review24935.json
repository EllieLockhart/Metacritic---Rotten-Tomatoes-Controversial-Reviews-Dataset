Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My god it's hidious.There are of course 2-3 EPIC scenes.Visually it's amazing but the story the plot holes the decisions they took drives me insane.The end is here for the Star Wars franchise.Those disney assholes will get the memo when the han solo film will hit rock bottom","true":true}
