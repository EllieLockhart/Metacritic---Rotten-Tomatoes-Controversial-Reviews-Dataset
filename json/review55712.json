Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the the worst most boring bait and switch movies I could've imagined. Forgetting all gaping plotholes\\, which make the movie bad enough as is\\, after all the buildup\\,  they ruined Luke's legacy as an angry sad old man\\, gave us no backstory on Snoke who was a potentially great villian\\, took a poop all over Reys background and made a joke of the only remaining villians.  Who cares what happens next? I'll rent ep. 9 at the library when its free. Rian Johnson is a total and utter hack\\, and sadly JJ Abrams has no sense of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
