Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not understanding how people oversaw the lack of direction and lack of character development of this chapter. Star Wars was the franchise that knows how to develop well-crafted stories but this chapter was the exception. Let me just remind you all: This is an opinion of mine. Everyone is entitled to one. I've been a fan for decades but this one seriously sticks out like a sore thumb in the lack of the great story telling I know and love.","true":true}
