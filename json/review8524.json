Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First class junk dressed up as a Star Wars film. So many plot holes\\, characters needlessly killed\\, senseless sub plots\\, an obsession with fuel & pointless contradictions\\, it appears to have been written as a project by someone who has no understanding of Star Wars lore.\\n\\nAs for the argument that \\\"my kids liked it\\\"\\, my kids also like Happy Feet ! \\n\\nI could rant for hours about all that is wrong with this\\, but in short\\, the director\/writer appears to have fallen in to the trap of thinking defacing art is also an art form. It isn't.","true":true}
