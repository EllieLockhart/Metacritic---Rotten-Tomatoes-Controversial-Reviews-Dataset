Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good:\\n- Brilliant visuals - puts the prequels to shame. \\n- Excellent sound\/music (or lack of it during the hyperspace into snoke's ship moment)\\n- Great fight scene in the throne room. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n- Plot holes galore. Not going to go into details\\, just watch any review on youtube. \\n- Leia's superman moment in space was pure stupidity. \\n- The whole casino\/code breaker subplot with Fin and Rose was pointless and only made the movie 30 minutes longer for no good reason. \\n- Rey's character is a Mary Sue. Not relatable at all. \\n- Luke's death was stupid and made no sense. \\n- Character development non-existent.  Especially with Kylo's character. Why did he kill his dad and is so evil?  I'm not looking for Brothers Karamazov level of analysis\\, just something that makes a little bit of sense. \\n- Almost every scene on Luke's island was pointless and stupid\\, from milking an alien's nipples\\, to pole vault fishing to oversized frog nuns. \\n- Snoke's death felt cheap and rushed.\\n- What they did with Luke's character was shameful.  Turned him into a grumpy hermit loser. \\n- Yoda's scene didn't add anything beyond...nope\\, I got nothing. \\nThere's plenty more but who has the time. Others have said it better. \\n\\nWorst Star Wars film of the franchise.","true":true}
