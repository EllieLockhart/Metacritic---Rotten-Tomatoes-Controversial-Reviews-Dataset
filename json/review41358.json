Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is amazing in so many ways\\, I just love it.\\nI came expecting another Star Wars movie and left so impressed. Not only I get character development\\, beautiful action scenes\\, and characters that feel like real people so much instead just being the heroes\/villains of the war on turn\\, they have a background\\, they make sense and you can sympathize with them. You get attached to them and want to know more. And yes\\, I loved seeing the women in this movie been more than a political figure or village people \u00b72.\\nAnd the photography\\, and the way they handle the scenes the characters of Kylo and Rey. I can't wait to get the novelization of this film\\, to see the next Episode. Honestly\\, for me Star Wars was only a movie you most see in name of culture pop\\, now I truly like it and I want to see more of this beautiful universe.","true":true}
