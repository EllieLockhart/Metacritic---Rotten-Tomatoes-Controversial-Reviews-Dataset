Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As usual\\, best to ignore the nonsense the critics write.  This is an enjoyable enough film and worth a watch\\, but don't expect to be blown away by it.  Its's enjoyable nonsense\/","true":true}
