We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I played the game when it came out and I had high hopes considering the positive reviews and I hadn't read the leaks that came out.\r\rA lot of people on this website complain that the game has too much SJW forced into our faces\\, but I don't see a lot of SJW put into faces. The only SJW content really shown is that Ellie is gay and dates Dina. This isn't a problem and is not that bad of a thing.\r\rThe biggest flaw of the entire game is the story that it revolves around. Graphics are breathtaking and the gameplay is similar to that of the first game\\, but the story writing is flawed. In the beginning\\, the game kills off one of the most beloved characters in gaming. I wouldn't have any issue with this if the character was given a noble death that may have been a bit longer in the story. The problem is that the character is killed off early and attempts to make you feel sympathetic towards the killers actions.\rThe game only attempts to make you feel sympathy halfway in the game when you obviously hate the killer and Ellie is in a heated moment.\r\rOne of the biggest story flaws I had was the ending of the game. The first game had me thinking whether Joel eradicating the fireflies and throwing away the fate of humanity was worth it. The ending had a bit of wholesomeness with Joel and Ellie retiring to Jackson.\rThis ending isn't wholesome or fulfilling;it's outright depressing.\rThe entire theme of the game is revenge and at the end\\, Ellie doesn't get the revenge she wanted and lets Abby go. Dina just straight up leaves Ellie and she is abandoned at the end.  The ending had me depressed and feeling that none of the 30 hours I put into the game was worth it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
