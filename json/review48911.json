Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars ever. Seriously\\, even worse than Revenge of the Sith. We're left with more questions than ever about Snoke\\, and they try to rid of any sort of significance previous films held. Also\\, the character Rose makes JarJar seem enjoyable by comparison. This has classic Disney-Marvel syndrome: there's a ridiculous amount of unfunny jokes just randomly sprinkled through the movie like some kind of depressing glitter.  This movie was about as deep as a small puddle.  It feels like The Force Awakens and this movie have so little in common that it barely feels like a sequel. All the things that were built up to be interesting and mysterious in the first movie were just completely dismissed in the most flippant and disappointing way possible. Did I mention how incredibly annoying Rose was? most useless and disposable character in Star Wars canon.","true":true}
