Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie by any measure. Plot lines are incoherent\\, characters are shoehorned in and lack any modicum of development\\, etc.. Do not see this movie in theatres\\, do not give disney your money\\, they have done jack all to deserve it.","true":true}
