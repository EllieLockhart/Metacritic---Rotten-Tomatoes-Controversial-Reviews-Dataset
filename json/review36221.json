Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was the worst Star Wars movie oh my god... *IT PRETTY MUCH DECLARED THAT EVERYTHING WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE DOES NOT MATTER NOW.* Absolutely everything about the movie is non-nonsensical \\n\\nDon't you see the pattern here? They want to destroy everything what Lucas have built. How can someone defend this is *BEYOND* me. Those 92% on RT are ALL BOUGHT BY DISNEY. Simple as that.\\n\\n52% of audience score says everything. Even Phantom Menace wasn't that low. *PHANTOM. MENACE.*\\n\\nAnd that f***ing line by Kylo Ren pretty much sets the slogan of the new Lucasfilm: \\\"The past is dead\\, kill it if you have to.\\\"\\nThat pretty much says everything. They don't have respect to Star Wars lore at all. Disney want to do their own thing\\, which is rehashing the same ideas in the new brand OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It's the red ring of death.\\n\\nStar Wars is officially dead to me.\\n\\nRIP Star Wars 1977-2017 (40 years of fun and exciting franchise was killed by the most monopolistic company on planet Earth)\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S.
