Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this movie.  I'm a fan of the series but Hollywood is so concerned with gender equality it feels forced at times and the plot is all over the place.  To many loose ends that are never explained and they killed off the most interesting character recently in the series.  It feels to big now for Rey\\, Finn\\, Ren\\, and Poe.  I watched Rogue One again last night and it would have been more effective if they just started a new series after this movie.","true":true}
