Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm super confused as to why critics are liking this movie. I have literally not talked to a single person that liked this movie. It's probably the worst star wars film to date. That being said\\, there were some really great visuals and actions scenes. I also though Mark did well with what he was given. I feel like Ryan and Disney spit in my face.","true":true}
