Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie did something I didn't think possible. It made me wish George Lucas were still in control of his property. I wish I could say I loved this and it was a great step forward\\, but the story and the writing are so bad it's hard to look past. I love this franchise\\, I go to the celebrations\\, I collect the collectibles\\, I watch and rewatch. But this is a terrible installment that robs me of all enthusiasm to see Episode IX. It simultaneously lowers my faith that Rian Johnson getting his own Star Wars trilogy is a good thing. An absolutely terrible installment\\, it's like this was written without watching 'Return of the Jedi' and\\, instead\\, merely reading the Wikipedia plot synopsis on them. Heartbroken\\, couldn't be more disappointed.","true":true}
