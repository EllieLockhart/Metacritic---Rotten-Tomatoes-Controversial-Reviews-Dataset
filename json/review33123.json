Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a complete waste of potential.  Out with the old characters\\, and the new ones are forced in your throat with a rusty shovel.  An immature director brings immature humour and immature character development and relationships.  The First Order becomes a laughable comic relief\\, Rey learns barely anything from Luke.  And of course ordinary sexism while male characters are beaten for fun by female character (TFA had the same though).  Finding the map to Luke took a full movie\\, so Luke could barely do anything.  A terrible waste.","true":true}
