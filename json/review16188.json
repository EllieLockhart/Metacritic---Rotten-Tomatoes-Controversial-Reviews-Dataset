Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm gonna sound like an hypocrite here but if you pay attention\\, most 5 star comments look like they are from people who put more energy into attacking the critics rather than defending the movie. \\nThe movie is bad\\, even if you ignore the amount of political propaganda it contains. You can definine every character with just a few words because they dont have any deep development and everything is just superficial and poorly written.\\nSnoke is just the bad guy\\, that's it\\, he looks intimidating thanks to impressive CGI  but he's just a Disney villain\\, he failed at seducing Rey to the dark side because of her Mary Sue powers and determination\\, and failed to see Kylo's betrayal. \\nRey is still as overpowered and uniteresting as always\\nKylo is probably the coolest character in this movie just because the scene where he kills snoke is awesome","true":true}
