Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grow up with the original saga. always loved the story since a little boy. i was so exited when the prequels got announced. watch them and didn't care much about them. I can even say that i enjoy the prequels at some degree. \\nthe force awakens was a new hope with a twist. it was a reboot that introduces us with new heroes and villains. \\nthe last jedi was really a big DISAPPOINTMENT. i felt mistreated as a fan. i can't tell here what things i didn't like because it would be to long. \\ni won't buy any merchandise from this movie and i'm sad to say that i won't be going pay to see  star wars 9 or any new release. \\nthey went to far and some things can't be undone.","true":true}
