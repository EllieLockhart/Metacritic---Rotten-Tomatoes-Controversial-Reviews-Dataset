Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who grew up with and had a childhood and adolescence saturated with the Star Wars saga and extended universe\\, this movie is an absolute travesty to the franchise.  It was clearly written\\, directed\\, and produced by people who do not have an appreciation for the Star Wars legacy.  There are cross-overs and parallels to the original trilogy that attempt to evoke nostalgia\\, but these function more like gimmicky deja vu's bereft of character development  and plot continuance.  The visuals and score are stunning\\, it is a very pretty and audibly immersive film\\, but these flashy scenes and crisp graphics cannot cover up how tragically Rian Johnson mishandles Luke Skywalker\\, or the multitude of inconsistencies and plot holes in the story.  \\n\\nThis film genuinely saddened me.  I placed my trust in Disney to safeguard the franchise and develop movies that extend the Star Wars story beyond the destruction of the Empire\\, and I am left feeling betrayed and dismayed.  \\n\\nI hate this movie.  I hate it with a bright\\, burning passion.  I hate it with all the force of a Mon Calamari cruiser ramming into a Super Star Destroyer in hyperspace.","true":true}
