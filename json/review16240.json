Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a fanboy (or a boy at all)\\, though I enjoyed the original trilogy quite a lot. This movie is simply a narrative mess with so many shaggy dog dead-ends and extraneous characters...Why the critics are so praising of it I'll never know. My biggest gripe: It's long past time for a Black Jedi. Why can't there be two? Why do the white woman get all the glory and win all the gold stars? (I'm a white woman incidentally...) Such a disappointment.","true":true}
