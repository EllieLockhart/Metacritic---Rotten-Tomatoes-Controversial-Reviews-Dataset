{"101487":134531,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater in a strange mood\\, confused\\, not really knowing if I wanted to see the next installment.  I may\\, only because JJ will direct it... but I hope he gets NEW script writers...\\nWhat was Snoke's purpose? How did he get those scars? Why was driving him to destroy the republic?  Why did he have so many followers? How did he turn Kylo?  Apparently the writers didn't care about that storyline... so they didn't even give him a good death scene... no Luke vs Snoke moment...\\nLuke's legacy is... the writers didn't care about Luke\\, they butchered Luke and depicted him as a coward child murderer.  Did they read episode4\\,5&6? No wonder Mark Hamill expressed his disagreement.  I agree w\/him. \\nRey? Her story is less interesting than ever before.  I could care less if she dies as Snoke did because she is boring as a main character.  Jedi training?  Who needs it! Anyone can use the force w\\o training.  Rey is doing things that other Jedi's struggled w\/for years.  Luke could barely lift rocks while training w Yoda\\, but Rey picks up a bunch of heavy rocks like nothing... it's ridiculous.\\nThe best character of the last Jedi is... Kylo REN.  I want that guy to kill the resistance and see what happens next.  He is the most complex character in the 9 Star Wars films thus far.  Mark Hamill was amazing as well\\, even with the horrible storyline that was forced on him.  I don't know why they made him disappear at the end... I think that was dumb but then again there are many other dumb scenes...\\nThere are many half thought out scenes in this movie that I am gonna pretend I never watched it.  I hope JJ can fix this... gosh... what a mess.\\nEsta es la peor pel\u00edcula de Star Wars que haya visto.  Porque?  Porque Luke no es un asesino de ni\u00f1os\\, porque Luke nunca har\u00eda las cosas que nos quieren hacer creer.  Los escritores no leyeron el episodio 4\\,5\\,6. \\nY Snoke? Todo el misterio de Snoke fue a la basura\\, y Fin? Y el code breaker? Y la nave de la galaxia lejana que no tiene piloto autom\u00e1tico y requiere q alguien se quede para disque pilotearla y Leia ... en el espacio flotando y peor a\u00fan la tripulaci\u00f3n abriendo puertas de naves en el espacio como si estuvieran en el planeta tierra... est\u00e1 pel\u00edcula es para el olvido... casi una hora y media de escenas que no tienen relevancia.  Rey se mete al agujero seg\u00fan del lado obscuro de la fuerza y para qu\u00e9? Para nada... no pas\u00f3 nada... y Snoke que seg\u00fan era un master de la maldad pas\u00f3 sin pena ni gloria. Y Fin se olvid\u00f3 de Rey y seg\u00fan se enganch\u00f3 con un personaje irrelevante... y Yoda? Apareci\u00f3 para q la gente se olvide de las otras escenas... y Obi One? No le habl\u00f3 a Luke para nada... \\nhay buenas escenas? Si las hay.  La batalla en el planeta de la sal\\, el casino estuvo interesante pero como q no comput\u00e9 como fue Fin hasta all\u00e1 mientras los rebeldes trataba de escapar... en Fin ir a la velocidad de la luz ... bueno... \\nOJAL\u00c1 JJ pueda arreglar esto","true":true}
