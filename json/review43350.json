Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a horribly done film. I have an image of disney telling the producers and script writers what they wanted for an end product and then bastardizing the script to make it fit. There was no regard nor consistency of characters. I winced listening to Yoda utter very long sentences which tried to accommodate his way of speaking but ultimately lost meaning by the end. Luke emerged as nothing and overall\\, everything that years of films had built up was swept away by one or two sentences. I can only wonder what kind of script was left on the editing room floor. There was not one shred of film that I could honestly say was true to the integrity of the series built upon for so many years. It was truly as if the writers wrote their dialogue and jokes with utter disregard for which character said what. The end result was that we as viewers had no true sense of who these people were\\, speaking out of character. I was ready to walk after the first two lines of dialogue but had come with someone and didn't want to leave them in the theater. I wasn't aware at the time that I would have to sit there 2 1\/2 hours. This is the first time I have walked out of a Star Wars movie. I am grateful that others are speaking their truth on the rotten tomatoes site as well.","true":true}
