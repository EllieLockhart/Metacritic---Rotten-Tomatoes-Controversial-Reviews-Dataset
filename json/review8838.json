Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this movie was enthralling. Perfect balance of action\\, character development\\, humour and drama. The pace was perfect\\, the new characters were introduced without a rush and well-developed and had meaningful storylines that added perfectly to the plot of the movie. The characters from the original trilogy\\, including one that made a surprising appearance\\, were treated with respect and it was made clear that the script and directing were carried by people who love the saga. Moreover\\, the plot is unpredictable enough\\, chosing paths that often are the less expected by the viewers.\\nI cannot truly express my admiration for this movie. Stunning visuals and a narrative that really ties up every scene in it. There's still some questions to be answered\\, but we still have episode IX. My only complains are not getting Obi Wan Kenobi's force ghost form and also the fact that captain Phasma's appearance felt a bit short after all the attention Gwendoline has been getting in the press. Although her appearance was very powerful\\, I was expecting to see more of her.\\nIf I had to describe the movie in two words\\, they would be \\\"poweful\\\" and \\\"meaningful\\\".","true":true}
