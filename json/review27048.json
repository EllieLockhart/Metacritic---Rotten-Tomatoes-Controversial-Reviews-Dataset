Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the better Star Wars movie's I've seen. Lots of powerful metaphors. Music was exceptional. Can tell they threw a lot of $ into the production. Particularly\\, Benicio del Toro shows the range of his ability as an actor. Movie was suspenseful\\, ending was predictable. Porgs were adorable. The scene when Rey (Daisy Ridley) arms got locked up during her battle alongside Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and she drops the light saber from one hand to the next was bad ass.","true":true}
