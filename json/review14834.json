Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched this movie two times so far. The first time I watched it\\, I was not at all impressed (except a few scenes). However\\, on the second time I realized how good the movie was. I am a huge Star Wars fan and I understood how many fans feel betrayed by Rian Johnson's vision. It is different\\, and as Luke says in the movie \\\"this is not going to go the way you think.\\\" \\nI guess in the end it all comes down to fans understanding the fact that some things will have to change in order for the franchise to grow. We can't always live in the same nostalgia. For The Force Awakens\\, everyone complained that it was  too similar to A New Hope; now\\, everyone is complaining that it is completely different and it doesn't seem like Star Wars at all! \\nNow I am not saying that this movie is perfect\\, all I am saying is that it is a good movie with a few flaws. For example\\, the marvel-like jokes that are in the movie. (SPOILERS AHEAD) I mean\\, the scene where Rey hands the lightsaber to Luke and he throws it away\\, was that supposed to be funny? I guess\\, because some of the audience did actually laugh. But me\\, my friends ( a bunch of Star Wars fanboys) were not happy seeing that. I was emotionally into that scene\\, and since the time I had found out that Johnson would bring us back to the same cliffhanger scene from TFA\\, I was looking forward to this specific scene; but I was disappointed by the director's pointless vision. Had they not tried to make the movie too funny in situations like these\\, it might have earned 4.5 out of a 5 from me. Another scene that left me kind of disappointed was Snoke's death. I don't care about his backstory\\, all I wanted from his character was some depth. \\nIn the end\\, I would like to conclude by saying that give this movie a chance. I know it is different\\, and you may think that \\\"this is the death of Star Wars\\\" (this is something I overheard someone say in the theater\\, kinda left my jaw opened). But sometimes\\, you have to \\\"let the past die\\\" and see what the future holds. You never know\\, there might be something great planned ahead for the franchise.","true":true}
