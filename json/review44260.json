Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long and too derivative and 9 out of 10 overall. Lots of elements from 5 and 6 but the narrative is good\\, the trope subversion is great and the film actively fought against everything I hated about the last movie.","true":true}
