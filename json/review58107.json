Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow . . . Disney killed Star Wars. Some great visuals\\, and funny moments-but far too many awful parts. The main villain (Snoke) from the first movie turns out to be a dud (and his generic bodyguards were a joke). Where are the Knights of Ren anyway? Kylo-Ren is no Vader (or Darth Maul). And the penguin\/seals? What was that all about? Was that thrown in to sell stuffed animals or make a new Pixar movie? Flat plot: \\\"Oh . . . we are running out of gas! For the entire movie. Oh\\, and don't hate the unlikable purple-haired hero lady. She has one moment that *proves* she is a hero after all. And the whole \\\"Let's ignore the effects of a body blown into space (for 3-5 minutes) and Leia suddenly comes back to life and flies like Superman(tm) back to the ship.\\\" Wow. I actually feel insulted by this movie. So many more wasted moments. THIS IS NOT STAR WARS. This is not even a story. It is a jumble of things happening in space run through a corporate machine. but it will make a lot of money and critics will suck up to Disney now that there is no other major studio that can make something this big. If you disagree with any of this\\, just watch this movie and then immediately watch the very first Star Wars. You will see how far the apple has fallen from the tree.","true":true}
