Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie has NO payoffs that was set up from the Force Awakens. None. Forced slapstick humor\\, including \\\"Your Momma\\\" & \\\"Can You Hear Me Now\\\" jokes. People able to breath and operate in space\\, introducing hyperspace as a weapon now (why not just create autopilot x-wings to hyperspace into ships?). The movie just ruins everything that the past SW Movies have taught us. A lot of liberal messages as well.... in a SW movie. In a MOVIE. Will not see anymore from here on out.","true":true}
