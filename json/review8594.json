{"101487":121355,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I love Star Wars. I grew up watching VHS tapes of the original trilogy with my family\\, and have been a big fan since. The prequel films were not so great\\, but at least they felt like they fit into the saga well\\, and had acceptably logical plots. However\\, the stale acting and silly characters in some parts made them much less appealing than the originals.\\n\\nCome the sequel trilogy\\, I was ready for some dark plots and exciting action scenes with all the new effects technology available. The Force Awakens wasn't bad\\, and set up the prospects for an exciting return to a darker\\, more intense Star Wars that rivaled the originals. \\n\\nThen came The Last Jedi. By the first hour I was already bored\\, and when Leia flew back to the ship despite being torpedoed into space (literally by torpedoes)\\, I gave up trying to like this film. Major issues are as follows:\\n-Leia surviving being blown up and sent into space for several minutes\\n-Side plots that were superfluous\\, ie: Finn and his sidekick Rose\\, which served only to push a PC agenda on a fantasy film. We get it\\, corporations selling weapons to fuel wars is bad\\, a diverse cast of strong female leads and \\\"minorities\\\" fighting a force of white males with a monopoly on military power good. Fight the system man! *Sarcasm*\\n-NO PLOT: 2 hours of Luke being out of character and childishly hiding from Rey\\, coupled with a mind numbing \\\"chase\\\" of the Resistance fleet by the First Order.\\n-No explanation of Snoke and a cop-out on Rey's back story\\n-Merchandising: little hamster bird things\\, crystal foxes\\, resistance rings\\, unnecessary characters will be showing up in stores for Christmas gifts.\\n\\nBottom Line Up Front: The Last Jedi bastardizes the original characters\\, totally mishandles a promising plot line\\, and pushes some weird messages that don't belong in a fantasy film. It is boring\\, lacks the large scale combat we expect (except for one cool lightsaber fight) and just sucks in general. \\n\\nI'm saddened and disappointed. The Star Wars I knew is dead. This new one is just a stupid boy in a mask pretending to be the real Vader.","true":true}
