Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People seem to hate on everything they have nostalgia for. Honestly this movie pulled me in every direction emotionally\\, and there were a couple of moments that made me go \\\"why...?\\\" But I can't remember leaving a theater with so much excitement except for probably the potter movies. Go see it!","true":true}
