{"101487":169368,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS AHEAD: I really don't understand how people think The Last Jedi was worse than any of the prequel movies. TLJ was different\\, but an GREAT different. It was its own movie\\, which is something that The Force Awakens isn't. From this point on\\, there are SPOILERS:\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nOne thing that really bugged me (and I'm surprised more people aren't talking about) is the Casino. The casino was VERY tacky. I do understand how it all ties into the story\\, finding the code breaker\\, and with the kid and the end\\, but I'd expect the Casino in a Marvel movie\\, not a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nThe Porgs were there JUST to sell toys. At least Ewoks formed an army. Everything about Rose was meh. Leia surviving in the beginning was BS. I really think a lot of what made people mad will be revealed in Episode IX. I really think we'll still get Snoke's back story. How Maz got Anakin's lightsaber will be explained. I think there are things Kylo isn't telling us about Rey's parents. (Let's not forget who Anakin Skywalker's mom was. She was a slave\\, and so was Anakin.)\\n\\nOverall\\, I LOVED how they developed Poe\\, I LOVED BB-8 (who unlike Porgs\\, contribute to the story\\, BUT SERIOUSLY\\, even those Ice Puppies showed the Resistance a way out of that last base.) CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT HYPERSPACE RESISTANCE SHIP SHOT?! That was some gorgeous cinema-photography. I am satisfied with how Luke went out. I'm interested to see what they do with Kylo and Rey in IX.","true":true}
