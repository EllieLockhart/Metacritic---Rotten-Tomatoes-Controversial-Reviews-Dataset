Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO PLOT DETAILS OR SPOILERS! \\nYOU'RE SAFE HERE!\\n\\n\\nMy \\\"reviews\\,\\\" are really just gut reactions that I can remember and jot down. Forgive the sloppy styling\\, grammatical errors and general upheaval of my writing. While I do try and write something cohesive and obeying film review etiquette\\, mostly\\, I say fuck that. What I love about theater going\\, is the surge of emotions I experience\\, especially during a particularly bad or a truly great film. I try (and likely fail) to translate that feeling into my writing but hey\\, I warned you. You can stop now and I'll never know.\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\\nWatched 12\/15\\n\\nThis is a tough review to write. It's hard for me to generate much excitement for Star Wars nowadays. It's a franchise that's been around for decades. The first film hit theaters in 1977. Thats 40 years ago. And let's be honest it has not been an amazing 40 years. I feel with the recent explosion of reboots and sequels and spin-offs\\, well planned until the 2030's\\, each new release feels less special and significant.\\n\\nThat is where I am at with Last Jedi.\\n\\nI'd be lying if I didn't say I felt a small tingle of excitement in my stomach when the iconic yellow title popped onto the screen\\, my entire life I've been watching these movies and here I am 25 years later watching one again. I do not want these new films to be remakes or told in the same exact fashion as the original trilogy. But\\, these recent additions have not captured any of the magic for me at all. It makes me feel terrible\\, am I cynical? Jaded? Perhaps\\, but I just haven't been able to get into these new movies the I really want to.\\n\\nEnough evasion\\, I'll just get to it.\\n\\nLast Jedi is a good movie. On a technical aspect it's nearly flawless. Is that good enough? Is it fair that I feel a Star Wars movie needs more than cool effects\\, and to look pretty? About half\\, that's 50%\\, of this film really worked for me. Mainly every scene with Luke. Everything else felt too familiar\\, too safe. But on the flip side\\, series creator George Lucas took risks and tried something really different for Episodes 1-3\\, which (take a deep breath here) aren't nearly as bad as people say they are. Lucas took his story in bold\\, new directions and every day after that he was one of the most hated men in Hollywood. His fanbase became one of the most volatile and vile and rabid\\, pits ever. Everyone took their shots at Lucas and made him feel like a piece of shit for not exactly replicating the original trilogy\\, these people say he ruined their childhood. If the original creator of the series cant do something different without the world freaking out...it makes sense Disney would want to play it safe\\, for example a major criticism of The Force Awakens is that it's basically a New Hope remake. How can these directors win? Damned if you change it\\, damned if you don't.\\n\\nWith that being said\\, director and writer Rian Johnson tried a few (like 4) things I really liked such deeper messages as to what the light side and the dark side truly mean as well as new tweaks to Jedi lore. I liked how Johnson took some risks with the way characters interact with The Force\\, especially.\\n\\nThe times the film felt dull is when we were in the familiar. Every action scene (except for the stunning\\, breathtaking conclusion) felt slow and repetitive\\, following the same format: a fight starts\\, a lot of people die\\, it looks like the good guys are going to lose\\, someone comes and saves their ass\\, the bad guys die. Wash\\, rinse\\, repeat. These sequences look incredible\\, yet they don't stimulate or push any boundaries. It's these scenes that keep me from completely losing myself in the magic that is storytelling.\\n\\nJJ Abrams set up some beautiful characters in The Force Awakens\\, much needed diversity was added to the franchise\\, Daisy Ridley as Rey\\, John Boyega as Finn\\, and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron\\, all shine in The Force Awakens. In The Last Jedi only one of them really develops and takes on new life\\, the other two fall into relatively stereotypical roles.\\n\\nA key component of great cinema are set pieces. The Star Wars franchise hosts some of the best settings and environments ever created. The Mos Eisley Cantina\\, The Garbage Compactor in the Death Star\\, Yoda's home in Dagobah\\, the volcanic Mustafar\\, to name a few. The Last Jedi is missing that\\, with the exception of the mysterious island Luke occupies. We do get to a few different locations through this film\\, but they feel generic and unlively. We are primarily on ships. No memorable aliens chilling in the background puffing on death sticks\\, the one setting that is close to that is primarily the CGI fest we are used to.\\n\\nThis is also the longest Star Wars movie ever made\\, and it feels like it. I just couldn't get lost in this movie. I tried. With that being said\\, the last 30 minutes of this film are the best Star Wars minutes in decades. The conclusion to Last Jedi is absolutely incredible. Finally after two hours I finally get pulled in. We get an amazing setting\\, new and old characters\\, and a finale we've been working towards since Force Awakens. I refuse to say anything else\\, but if it wasn't for that last act\\, this film would've been nearly a total loss for me. So please believe just how hard I am praising it.\\n\\nYou should see this movie\\, there really are some great scenes and refreshing ideas and that ending will be talked about for some time\\, but it is far from flawless and its run time is testing. There is a formula here that may be impossible for Disney to figure out. How much new blood can we infuse to this franchise? The end of Last Jedi leaves me hopeful. Ball's in your court Abrams.","true":true}
