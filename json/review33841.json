Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible!\\nPlot was awful (what plot?) and the main characters were so unbelievably weak it was a joke. Kylo Ren is the most pathetic villain ever devised in the trilogy.","true":true}
