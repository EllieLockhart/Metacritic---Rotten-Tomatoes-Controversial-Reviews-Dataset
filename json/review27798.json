Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps not as bad as some people make it out to be however one of my least favourite all time star wars films overall. After the force awakens and rogue one\\, (which i truly enjoyed)\\, i was totally primed to see this film. Once the end credits started to roll i found that i was trying to convince myself i liked it and ultimately conceded to myself that i didn't really. \\n\\nMain things that I didn't care for :\\n\\n- left confused about the reason for Rey's journey to meet Luke (one of the main focuses of TFA) \\n\\n- the build up and subsequent sudden and anticlimactic death of the big bad felt unfulfilling (although this death could have been a red herring) \\n\\n- a trip by two characters to a planet that takes up a significant portion of the film feels out of place and ultimately ends up having no purpose \\n\\n- the attempted epic send off for THE ultimate star wars hero falls flat on its face... Dissapointing \\n\\nThere are quite a few other issues as well but those are the ones that really stand out. At the end of the day I'd say it ranks somewhere around episode 2 which is probably the star wars film i enjoyed least.","true":true}
