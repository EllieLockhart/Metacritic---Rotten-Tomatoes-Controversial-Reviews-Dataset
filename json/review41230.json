Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie... I really don't have much to say about this movie that you probably haven't already heard. This movie has caused me to lose interest in the Star Wars universe. I  don't think I will be seeing anymore Star Wars movies from here out.","true":true}
