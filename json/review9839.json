Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the franchise. For once I agree with the critics score and NOT the audience. These fanboys\/girls need to realize the story isn't over yet and your fan theory doesn't matter\\, get over it. Can't wait for 9 and Solo!","true":true}
