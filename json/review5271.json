Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a different type of Star Wars movie. Quite a dense film with plenty of intricate story telling\\, which mostly works (some of it is meh). I really enjoyed it.","true":true}
