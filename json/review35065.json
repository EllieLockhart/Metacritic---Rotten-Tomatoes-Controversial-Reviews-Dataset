Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first third was goofy\\, the second third has Finn going to a casino that looks like it's out of the prequals and just needed not be there (nothing but a way to shove the warning about the military industrial complex down our throats but (SPOILER) YODA SHOWING UP....THANK THE MAKER....in the third act we get to see Leia flying (no no no no\\, just looked goofy) but (SPOILER) Luke's fight with Kylo....yeah\\, that just really worked for me!  Going in this new direction...it needed to happen and it's wonderful.....PLEASE\\, TO DISNEY WHOM I WORSHIP AND ALL AT LUCAS FILM...PLEASE HAVE SOME RABID FANS WATCH THE NEXT ROUGH CUT TO ROOT OUT THE CRINGE WORTH CRAP THAT KEEPS ENDING UP IN THESE FILMS!!!","true":true}
