Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It honestly seems like they tried to ruin Star Wars. It was good for the first half and then they just gave up and threw everything you liked and cared about out the window.","true":true}
