{"101487":149793,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's start by saying I was quite excited to see this film. Rian Johnson did a fine directing this flick. If this The Last Jedi was anything But a 'Star Wars' movie\\, I likely would have given it 3-3.5 stars. He did an excellent job subverting all major fan theories. The one glaring weekness\\, from viewing this as a stand alone fim\\, was the subplot surrounding Rose & Finn...Which felt forced and likely should have been cut.\\nHowever\\, this film is part of a larger narrative\\, and that needs to be considered. The failings of this movie\\, as a 'Star Wars' movie are astounding.\\n1) Character background: Snoke- we hardly knew you\\, & you were never given any backstory what's over; Phasma- pegged as a major baddie\\, no background\\, barely utilized\\, & non threat; The First Order- where did they come from? How did they amass such power and resources? etc\\n2) A complete disdain for established characters that fans love: 1) Luke Skywalker - The hero of heroes\\, THE Last Jedi...Is reduced to an impotent crumudgeon\\, a reluctant teacher who turned his back on the Galaxy  and his family...a coward...who is seemingly offed by a heart attack & in every regard\\, is a Huge disservice to fans and the character; Admiral Ackbar- everyone's favorite meme\\, is killed unceremoniously off screen\\, etc\\n3) Suicide is ok...If it's for a good reason - Finn\\, Rose's sister\\, Admiral Hold all attempt to kill themselves for a good cause...The sheer volume of Kamikaze is not a good trend\\n4) Death - it is hard to grow attached to characters if they are all getting offed in unheard numbers. George RR Martin is impressed. The 'Rebel' army is reduced to a mere 25-30 fighters by the end of the movie\\, with no support to be found in the Galaxy....Come on...1)of the 2 major military forces in the Galaxy has a fleet of...4 ships\\, and by the end of the movie\\, 0 ships? Unrealistic\\n5) An apparent hatred of the past and the whole Skywalker lineage.  Star Wars has always been a family soap opera\\, within a galaxy ripe for expansion and future stories beyond the name...But to give the proverbial finger to what made the originals great\\, for no apparent reason\\, makes no sense\\, businesswise or story wise...\\n6) Childish behavior is Ok - from Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren having an incessant amount of adult temper tantrums\\, only to become THE New Supreme Leader\\, to Poe Dameron leading a mutiny with no repercussions\\, and to be left as essentially the defacto leader of the 'Rebels' sends a great narrative to Young folks watching this flick. \\n\\nOverall... Disappointed with now 2\/3 of the Disney produced Star Wars films. Rogue One stands out as an excellent\\, stand alone story\\, that successfully expands the  the universe. The Force Awakens pulled on nostalgia\\, but was a beat for beat\\, plageristic retelling of a New Hope. The Last Jedi is a decent film that sabtages what makes Star Wars fun & such a pop culture icon. It is likely my least favorite entry of the 3 newest movies","true":true}
