Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars but I really don't think this is a star wars film that hits home. Nor is this is a good movie in the vision of a non star wars related film either. It sent characters in an sprawl of quests that amounted to no victory\\, poor character development\\, and I would go as far to say it even downplayed characters from the Force Awakens prior instead of having them grow. I did not grow up in the original star wars era\\, I am still young\\, and saw episode 1 and 2 far later as well even\\, and all though those are considered to be not the best\\, they each left something amazing to talk about lore wise\\, further adding books and tv shows full of beloved support. episode one had Qui Gon\\, Darth Maul\\, young Obi Wan\\, etc. Episode two had the clones\\, Count Dooku\\, etc. While The last Jedi killed off the main antagonist and belittled the possible history of some of the protagonists. Which I am sure making the directors of the eventual 3rd installment scratching their heads on how to make a quality film. ","true":true}
