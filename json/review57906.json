Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an abysmal disaster this is. I am blown away. There is no story\\, just a string of meaningless episodes reduced to amateurish sketches by misplaced humor. The characters are obliterated\\, the SW cannon torn apart and no questions from TFA are answered. Rather\\, every storyline set up for this episode is callously destroyed and the only reason to have episode IX is to put someone else in charge and attempt to salvage something out of this intellectual desert. It's not worth it. Stay home.","true":true}
