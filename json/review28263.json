Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor nonsensical plot\\, bizzare elements that defy (even Star Wars) reality and so much cheese and comic relief. I think the phantom menace may have been better on account of the Darth Maul scenes. No tension\\, just bad.","true":true}
