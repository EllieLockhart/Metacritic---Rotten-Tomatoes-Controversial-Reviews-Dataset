Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed\\, underwhelmed. Never in a million years would I have believed anyone who told me I would not cry buckets at Luke Skywalker becoming one with the force. Yet it happened in this travesty of a Star Wars film\\, and I didn't shed a tear. Not because of Mark Hamill's performance - he was superb. Not even because they killed off Luke - I was prepared for that\\, and somewhat reconciled with the fact they were gonna do it\\, because no one involved in the sorry mess that is Disney-Lucasfilm has a clue what to do with such a quality character apparently.\\nAnyways\\, long story short. I liked -\\nThe \\\"performances\\\" of Mark Hamill\\,  Adam Driver\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Laura Dern. Everyone else ranged from mediocre to rubbish.\\nI disliked -\\nThe whole Canto Bight plot\\nThe juvenile\\, forced humour\\nAwful CGI\\nThe fight sequences - all of them\\nToo many new characters I really could not care less about.\\nI reeeally disliked -\\nSuperman Leia\\nMoof-milking Luke\\n........oh Lord\\, you know what? forget it. I could go on all day and it's like reliving a bad dream just thinking about it.\\nI'll just say this film felt like a Harry Pottter meets Marvel (at it's worst) meets Transformers meets Spaceballs meets West Side Story (those light sabre \\\"fights\\\" geez!!!) -meets Battlestar Galactica. In fact\\, it felt like anything BUT a Star Wars film. Thank you Rian Johnson\\, Disney and Lucasfilm for making this the first Star Wars film I will only ever see once. You are not getting one more penny out of me for this rubbish.","true":true}
