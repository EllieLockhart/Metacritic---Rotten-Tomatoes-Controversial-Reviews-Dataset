Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many plot holes\\nCringy dialogue\\nBad continuity\\nPoorly written characters\\nPoorly mastered voiceovers\\nA few badly edited shots\\nAn entirely irrelevant 30-minute subplot\\nSO many wtf\/eye rolling moments\\n\\n\\nBlame whoever you want for the poor reviews on here. It's not a good movie.","true":true}
