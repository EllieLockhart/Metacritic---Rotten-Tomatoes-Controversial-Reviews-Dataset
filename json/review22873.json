Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long version:\\nTo compare\\, the prequel trilogy was annoying because even though it had great visuals and a compelling story\\, there were too many charactersd that were shallow and annoying. In the sequel trilogy\\, everything that was wrong about the prequels has been multiplied by ten. The visuals are still great\\, but now there is no story and almost every character is shallow and annoying. Why Disney didn't get some proven saga writers like Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole to create a plot eludes me\\, but they didn't and the franchise suffers for it. \\n\\nShort version: Visuals alone do not a movie make.","true":true}
