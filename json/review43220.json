Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie was the worst star wars movie I\u2019ve ever seen. The plot is so lame\\, and the bad guys always want revenge. This movie was useless\\, and was too much for a movie. I hope this was the last star wars movie ever invented.","true":true}
