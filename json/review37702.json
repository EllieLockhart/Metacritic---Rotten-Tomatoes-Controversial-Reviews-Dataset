Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"There's something rotten in Rotten Tomatoes\\\"\\n\\nPlease someone explain me (also mansplaining if you like\\, I don't take it personally) how the hell The Last Jedi with its miser $6M box office and its incredible 91% score lays\\, in the Top Office Box list\\, between two movies with similar $6M box office but a much more credible 57% (The commuter) and 30% (Insidious: The last key)?\\nIf the movie is THAT good\\, why did so many people not want to watch it?","true":true}
