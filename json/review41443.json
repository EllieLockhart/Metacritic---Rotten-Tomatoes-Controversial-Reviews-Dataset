Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is as bad as the force awakens. There's only 3 plot lines\\, and the only plot line that is worth while is Rey & Kylo. The humor is misfired and sucks. The script and dialogue blow. And I got tired of hearing how trigger happy of a pilot Po is. I cant get the 2.5 hours of my life back and have lost any excitement for Disney's Star Wars movies.","true":true}
