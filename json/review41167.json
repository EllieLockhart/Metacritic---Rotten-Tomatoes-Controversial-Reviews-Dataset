Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has great scenes and has some exciting action. But this movie relies on plots that were never mention in either the original or the prequel trilogy. Don't believe all the subverting expectations garbage\\, because the movie still sucks. Ryan Johnson decidedly threw all the questions introduced in Episode 7 in the garbage. The movie is mostly spent on a tiny ship with hardly any conflict or lack of tension we see in other Star Wars Films. Go watch The Phantom Menace its better than this","true":true}
