Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic addition to the saga. This movie is EXACTLY what the series needed. Enough of the cliches we have come to expect. As said in the trailer; \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\" Is precisely what I would say to anyone going to see this film.","true":true}
