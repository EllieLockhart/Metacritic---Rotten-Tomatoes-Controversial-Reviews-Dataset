But everything you do has a consequence.\rWhat if there was something deeper underneeth the story?\rEverything is not all Black or White. Always check the two sides of a coin to evaluate the situation. What would you do in these or that position? THIS IS LIFE...\rSure it can be cruel sometimes but it is what it is.

I felt\\, joy\\, saddness\\, fear\\, anger\\, compation\\, all of this...\r\rFor all the haters out there\\, please\\, grow up. This is not a teddy bear and candy world. And also\\, just because a story doesn't fit your vision doesn't mean that it was bad.\r\rAnyway\\, i had much pleasure playing The Last Of Us Part 2.\rThe graphics are great and pushing the PS4 to the limits at the end of her life.\rThe acting is awesome\\, nothing more to say about it.\rMusic is a bit less present but the tone is more dark and i think this is the reason.\rGameplay is basically TLOU 1 with better gestion and mastery.\rOnly a few characters are less attractive because they are less developed.\rI personally loved the story\\, the way it is telled\\, trough cutscenes\\, gameplay\\, flash backs. and NO\\, the thread is not incorrect.\rIt has been done on purpose. You have to hate first\\, then see why\\, and then understand.\rI hope to see a DLC one day\\, and who knows\\, maybe a part 3.\r\rSo.\rAll i have to say is thank you Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dog for the amazing time i spent playing The Last Of Us Part 2\u2026 Expand","true":true}
