Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has (as of right now) a 56% audience approval. Attack of the Clones has a 57%. Let that sink in. That's all you need to know. This movie is garbage. I walked out feeling like my questions weren't answered. Snoke? Naahh he doesn't matter just kill him. Rey's parents? Nope just drunks who sold her for drinking money. What's Luke been doing this whole time on Ahch-To? Nothing super powerful or amazing at all. Just waiting to die. Oh and Leia is suddenly Superman. That one scene ruined this movie. ","true":true}
