Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a good watch but failed to address a lot of questions as well as give the fans what they want. The movie is plagued with a main story and a sub plot with Poe and Finn which just about mesh well enough to forgive it. Snoke is wasted; his origins or motivations are not explained at all and is killed in a bizarre in-climactic fashion. The explanation on who's Rey's parents are was a poor excuse and could have been done better if they are saving the revelation of her true parents for episode 9. BB8 who was the hero of episode 7 doesnt do as half a good job in episode 8 and chewy could have sat this one out. The movie feels a bit all over the place. For eg: one moment Rey is fighting along side Rey in Snoke's chambers and then next she's on the Millennium Falcon on the turret. Although a lot of us expected Luke to be fight; they poorly used him and he felt like a Yoda training young Luke but didn't do a good job. Captain Phasma who was said to be the next Boba Fett has practically 4 lines in episode 7-8 combined and again dies a premature death which is preceded with a fight that does not gratify. The humour fails in the movie many times and the whole movie is just missing that star wars feel even if they are trying to do something different. Before i forget... the Leia surviving and doing the superman thing; that was a joke. Just give her a good send off will ya.","true":true}
