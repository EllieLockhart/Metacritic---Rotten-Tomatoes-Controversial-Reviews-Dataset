Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney should stop doing Star Wars movies\\, they don't respect the lore or the characters\\, the cinematography\\, effects\\, script and characters are terrible\\, the movie is a convoluted mess\\, a copy of things from ESB and RotJ but without consistency and full of stupid twists that ruin the franchise forever.","true":true}
