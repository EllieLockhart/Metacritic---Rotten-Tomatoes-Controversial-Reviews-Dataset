Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi left both feelings of nostalgia and refreshment as one era ends and another begins in the anthology series. Mark Hamill's Luke is a very different Luke than we have seen before and the addition of characters brings new life to the series. Carrie Fischer gave one last incredible performance as Princess Leia.","true":true}
