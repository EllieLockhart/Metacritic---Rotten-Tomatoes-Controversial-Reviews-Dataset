Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILER ALERT* This movie had some truly brilliant moments. Every exchange between Kylo Ren and Rey had me totally engrossed. Mortal enemies with undeniable sexual tension? Hell yeah\\, I'm all over it. The revelation of Luke's disillusionment with the Jedi Order was sad\\, but it made sense. The cinematography was probably the best out of any Star Wars movie. I so enjoyed that they made great use of CGI but didn't overly rely on it. The ForceTime conversations had literally no special effects going on\\, and that made them feel far more rich and intriguing. And freaking Yoda shows up as a puppet? Yes! It felt like a truly respectful way to bring him back. I didn't particularly enjoy Finn and Rose's arc\\, though. I just kept wanting them to hurry up and get back to whatever was going on with the rest of the characters.","true":true}
