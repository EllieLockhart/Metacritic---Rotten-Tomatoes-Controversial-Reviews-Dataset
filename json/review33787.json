Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. What was the whole point of the trip to the Casino?! Added nothing to the plot. Marry Poppins the Space Witch?! What was that? Leia flying through space?! You know how Snoke came into power and control the force in such a way that it could traverse space and join Rey and Kylo's mind\\, no? We'll F U because we killed the guy like nothing. We had an epic moment when Finn was going to die snuffed by an unnecessary rescue. Why was the laser so far anyways?! My God so many errors I can't even think straight. Never see this movie.","true":true}
