Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man\\, I actually signed up for this site\\, just so I could leave this review. I usually share my opinions with friends and family\\, not the internet\\, but this movie is bad\\, just bad. \\nWhere to start\\, ah yes\\, that terrible opening scene with the phone call joke. That is some Scary Movie parody stuff\\, and makes the evil guys in the galaxy incompetent\\, after that I no longer cared what any of the rank and file bad guy said or did. They're obviously morons\\, and therefore not a threat.\\nContinuing down that path\\, all the terrible \\\"jokes\\\"\\, and \\\"funny\\\" moments were actually not funny\\, at all. Cringe worthy\\, yes\\, terribly timed\\, yes\\, poorly placed and executed\\, yes\\, but not funny.\\nTo save time\\, and space\\, I'm not going to list all the other things that I found horrible\\, as other reviewers have listed them over and over again\\, Luke\\, Rey's parentage\\, Leia Poppins\\, etc.\\nThis movie was a murder spree of the original characters. This was not a handoff\\, where the new generation takes over\\, and over time the old generation fades away. This was a murder spree.\\nI'm just going to state that this movie is a great disservice to the entire Star Wars franchise.\\nI do have one question\\, why are all the critics and media defending the movie so fiercely? I've yet to read an article or a critic review that acknowledges any of the negatives\\, all they try to do is \\\"explain\\\" all the grievances away.\\n\\n1 star for Mark  Hamill's performance.","true":true}
