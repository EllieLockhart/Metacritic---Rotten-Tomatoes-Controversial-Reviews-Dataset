Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While some storylines take away from the grandiose action\\, The Last Jedi is a stunning addition to not just the Star Wars Saga\\, but the Sci-Fi genre. Beautifully shot\\, incredibly acted\\, and just enough twists to keep you guessing\\, The Last Jedi is without a doubt another masterpiece in the Star Wars collection.","true":true}
