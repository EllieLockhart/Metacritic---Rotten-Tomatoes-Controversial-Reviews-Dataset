Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This looked and sounded like a Star Wars film. But it didn't feel like one. It was marginally entertaining in a very basic way\\, but when you consider the classic characters involved\\, they failed to register as genuine. The villain is compelling but the other characters seemed to be stifled a bit from their momentum of the previous film. None of my household enjoyed it and we are huge SW fans of all ages. No second viewing or DVD etc. kinda sad in a way....","true":true}
