Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hate used to be the way you get seduced to the dark side now its kylo ren taking his shirt off! Rian Johnson really did a wonderful job at expanding on the mythology\\, true seduction with pecs and a six pack rather than implied paths that emotions take you. The next trilogy is in no better hands than the king of twists and turns. I can only anticipate Rey's force healing factor and force retractable claws in the next one\\, anything less will be a disappointment. Force projection Kylo Ren in a thong is the next logical step in making the dark side more seductive. Snoke's death can only mean one thing\\, Rose and Paige's sith sister Darth Martha! \\nDid I mention the appropriate comedy? Hux\/Poe's verizon 'do you hear me now' surpasses even Jarjar Binks' Michelle Tanner 'how rude'","true":true}
