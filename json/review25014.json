{"101487":155550,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My review of Star Wars The Last Jedi.\\n\\n*Spoilers*.  I'll fill in some space so people who don't want spoilers don't read anything incredibly spoiling and that they're now reading at their own peril. \\n\\n It's a good Disney movie but a horrible Star Wars movie. The director did a good job trying to please the general audience but his decisions and direction did not make a good story.\\n\\nFirst and foremost\\, 90% of all the things that went wrong in this movie was Poe's fault.  Poe is an incompetent commander who should have received a far worse punishment than a demotion. He lost the entire bombing squadron\\, sending Finn and Rose on a useless mission that lead the First Order to discovering the escaping\\, cloaked fleet and the destruction of most of the fleet.  Jar Jar was an idiot but at least he didn't cause almost every problem.  \\n\\nNext there was the untimely deaths of Phasma and Snoke.  Phasma's book made her out to be the strongest warrior in the First Order who couldn't even be bested by the man who trained every single stormtrooper but yet she gets killed by the worst stormtrooper in history?  Snoke...the ridiculously bold statement that he was stronger than Palpatine and Vader but died to a hat trick from a cry baby with daddy\/uncle issues.  Kylo may be powerful but to say that he's now stronger than Palpatine\\, Vader\\, and Snoke? Get out of here with that. Kylo Ren is not a respectable character just like Anakin in Attack of the Clones.  \\n\\nGoing on to Admiral Holdo\\, she could have avoided Poe's biggest mistake of sending Finn and Rose if she had just had some ounce of leadership and informing her crew of her intentions. She caused the mutiny.\\n\\nThere was the timeline error:  the movie starts exactly where TFA left:  The fleet prepping to leave and Rey with Luke\\, this is where the timeline error begins. The fleet only had 16 hours of fuel while Rey spent 3 days with Luke but somehow ends up having enough time to make it to Snoke's ship before everyone dies.  \\n\\nLastly\\, the cheap and forced jokes and humor that were crap. Poe's phone call to the First Order to buy time\\, Luke chucking the most sentimental lightsaber to the entire series\\, and everything Porgs.  The phone call was completely cringeworthy and ridiculous; to see a vicious force like the First Order fall for such a stupid trick\\, they should have just killed Poe and saved the audience half the trouble of this movie.  Now for Luke...I would have expected a bit more surprise from Luke seeing his first lightsaber\\, especially being the lightsaber Obi-Wan had gave him that Luke's father\\, Anakin\\, had built.  The same lightsaber that Kylo Ren forgot was destroyed with his encounter with Rey but clearly sees with Luke just a few minutes later.  This should have told him that something wasn't right with Luke and after the hell of blaster fire that he survived.  With Luke being an apparition it was just total coincidence that there was a back door that Poe thought he entered.  The Porgs...the only worse thing to Star Wars than Jar Jar. Their only point to existence is to be an annoying and attempting to be cute creature for marketing.  Every scene with them was a forced plot relief\\, them doing something or something happening to them to distract the fans from the should be intense dramatic story line\\, not all that dramatic of a storyline to begin with.  The only scene I enjoyed with the Porg was Chewbacca eating them.  If the director needed to make the movie shorter\\, he could have removed the Porgs and saved a lot of time to make room for a real plot. \\n\\nI had almost forgotten the most ridiculous part of the movie; Rose falling in love with Finn after only spending a couple hours with him.  This is a completely idiotic forced storyline romance that just doesn't fit in at all.  This list should not have been this long and this movie should have been better. \\n\\nThe movie was a total cop out.  Killing Snoke and Phasma to avoid character development after unnecessary hype up and fans wanting to see more of them. Rey's parents being absolute nobodies because the director couldn't figure out who they could have been and just took an easy way out. \\n\\nAll in all\\, it was\\, actually\\, a good movie to watch but if you know anything about Star Wars then you know this movie took a crap on the rest of the series.  I'm really curious to see how people who's first experience with Star Wars was this movie will feel about the rest of the series when they see it\\, to include the other movies\\, tv series\\, and the books.\\n\\nI feel like I'm leaving something out but I covered just about everything that nearly killed my love of Star Wars. \\\"Let the past die\\\" is the only quote from the movie that is branded to my love of the series.","true":true}
