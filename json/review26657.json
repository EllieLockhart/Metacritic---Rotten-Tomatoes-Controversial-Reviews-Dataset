Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, I get it. You're pissed that this movie didn't fill all your fan theories. It left you with more questions then answers. Will we ever really find out about Rey's Parents? What's Snoke's Origin? Is it really time for the light and dark to end? But my question to all the theories is\\, Does it really matter? I know that some people need to have all the answers but for more going to the movies isn't about that. Its accepting an offering of a story that can take me to places I could never dream of and understanding that being entertained is something magical. Was the movies perfect? no\\, but most aren't. Did it capture my imagination and take me for the exact ride I was hoping for? Yes! The excitement of what could be next has\\, to me\\, always been the hallmark of his franchise. This was a fun story to experience and I hope others can understand what I mean.","true":true}
