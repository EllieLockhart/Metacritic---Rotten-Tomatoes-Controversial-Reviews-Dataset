Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last jedi has to be the biggest dissapointment in Star Wars history. Having grown up with the original trilogy I was not the biggest fan of Ep 1-3 which were a testament to the hubris of George Lucas. But this mess takes Hollywood's ability to screw up a franchise\\, for the sake of so called originality\\, to a whole new level. Taking already established characters and turning them into nothing more than a glorified cameo\\, while not bothering to actually flesh out characters like Snoke and Finn\\, was bad enough but the way in which they wasted those characters and their 30 year arcs was nothing short of Star Wars heresy! Luke specifically was relegated to nothing more than a winy hermit apparently never learning or growing as a person in his 30 plus years as a Jedi. While Rey\\, the great mystery\\, turns out to be\\, and I quote\\, \\\"Nobody\\\". Which is certainly where her character will remain in the hearts of true Star Wars fans\\, a nobody.  I can not express my disappointment with Disney right now. I'm certainly not excited for\\, or at all interested in\\, Episode 9. What a tremendous waste! Hope you're happy Rian Johnson you've completely destroyed  Star Wars!","true":true}
