Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like a kid who waited 2 years for Christmas and just found a lump of coal in my stocking. I walked out of the Force Awakens feeling positively giddy\\, and left the Last Jedi feeling disappointed and a little depressed. The sub-plots were ridiculous and added nothing to the story\\, especially the casino scenes. I found myself rolling my eyes and had flashbacks to watching the prequels in certain spots. It was great to see Luke\\, and I loved Mark's performance\\, but I cant understand why\\, if they wanted to sacrifice another hero\\, they didn't write Leah's death into the script instead of Lukes. With all 3 original stars gone\\, I fear for the next installment. There were some nice scenes with Kilo and Rey\\, but all in all\\, too many plot holes\\, un-answered questions\\, unnecessary characters and just bad storytelling. So disappointing after the Force Awakens terrific start to the series.","true":true}
