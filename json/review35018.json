Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The final half is entertaining. The first half has horrible pacing . Luke's storyline is a disappointment for anyone who hoped for an epic return and\/or send-off (some may disagree). Snoke is an underutilized character. The movie lacks heart. Left a bad taste in my mouth  and I'm not excited for what is to come. Very\\, very disappointed with the direction the took.","true":true}
