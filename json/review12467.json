Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot express into words how disappointed I am In Rian Johnson's choices for The Last Jedi. I am a Star Wars fan who actually values certain aspects of the prequels and really enjoyed The Force Awakens as well as Rouge One. \\n\\nSupreme Leader Snoke was probably the most intriguing character going into this movie. EVERYONE was infatuated with his backstory and what exactly his origins were I even expected him like many others to actually fight. Nope they east Snoke completely. \\n\\nLuke Skywalker I guess can't use his green lightsaber or leave the island. Way too difficult. We actually don't get a even get a lightsaber battle...instead we get 30 minutes at a casino where Fin and this irrelevant Asian chick free horses and get THE WRONG GUY and are shocked when he is a traitor. Complete joke. Might be the most disappointing movie of my life. I'm not mad...im disappointed","true":true}
