Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of flash but not enough substance. Too many loose ends and pointless plot rabbit-holes. Many moments will leave you scratching your head and a handful will make this film one of the best movie theater experiences of the year. It is an emotional roller coaster of let downs and high peaks. Regardless though\\, it is undoubtedly a very entertaining and exciting movie\\, just don't bring too much of your brain to watch the movie.","true":true}
