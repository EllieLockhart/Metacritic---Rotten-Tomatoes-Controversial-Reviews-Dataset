Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to see Luke Skywalker return as a Jedi Master and eventually restoring Coruscant back to its former glory with the Jedi Council.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, SPOILER\\, they killed him off \\\"to make room for the new characters\\\".

Well\\, it doesn't make sense to me.\\n\\nI am extremely disappointed.\\n\\nOh\\, and I also don't understand why we have to forget the old? Why do this? Is it because that Johnson writer may be a control freak and wants to impose his ideals on the audience? Does he want full freedom on just walking all over the \\\"franchise\\\"?","true":true}
