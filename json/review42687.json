Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was fantastic!  I totally felt my eyes misting up at all the best parts\\, while it had just the right amount of humor and great throwbacks to the original trilogy!","true":true}
