Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this movie in BKK in December. Since then I tried to cool down and actually even forgot about this whole mess. However\\, scenes of the movie came back to me and made me really sad that I broke with my promise not to watch the SJW-edition of Star Wars anymore\\, after TFA was such a pc-nightmare and Rogue One seemed to get the franchise back on track again.\\nThe story has so many plot holes and is illogical even to SF-standards (bomb drops in space\\, empire can't overhaul rebel ships etc.). At times it seemed as Disney just wanted to market toys (crystal foxes anyone?)\\nWhat really upset me\\, was how male characters were portrayed. Even a legend such as Luke was depicted as a petulant old geezer. New male cast was stupid and reckless - always in need of a female counterpart to be \\\"put back in place\\\". Male heroism and sacrifice was presented as irresponsible\\, whereas being a hero was only granted to female actors\\, who- of course - were almost always superior in command. This is not equality! This is misandry put into a well-loved franchise for \\\"educational\\\" purposes.\\nThis time\\, I swear that SW is dead to me. I will not even watch the next movie on a long flight. You won SJW\\, but I will always have my memories.","true":true}
