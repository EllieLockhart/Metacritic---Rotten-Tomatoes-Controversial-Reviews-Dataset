Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously\\, where are the plot holes these hater drones keep talking about? I'll save you the time. There's are not plot inconsistencies in The Last Jedi. This is one of the better Star Wars films\\, but let's not pretend than any of them are Citizen Kane. For a Star Wars film though this is easily the best written one I can remember. Perhaps that's why some people are still screaming about it six months later.","true":true}
