Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this film\\, it had so much promise in the first 10 minutes. doesn't even drive the story forward manages to undo the entire series with piss poor decisions. The director is not a fan of Star Wars\\, no true fan would ever allow that kind of film to be made. Luke deserved better\\, admiral Akbar deserved better\\, Poe Dameran is not a member of guardians of the galaxy. Rey is a pushover that is manipulated\\, all out of character from what we 've come to know of this franchise. The jokes don't work and  45 minutes nothing eventful happens\\, seriously this is a bad movie\\, not just a bad Star Wars movie\\, anything good about it is plagued by so much bad that to me it's killed a franchise I e loved since I was a boy.","true":true}
