I\u2019ve never played a game that makes me feel this involved and part of the story.\r\rThis game is a sequel\\, the story had to do something drastic to not be too repetitive with the first game.  I initially was not thrilled when I reached the \u201cmoment\u201d in the game which I think the negative reviews are focused on\\, but as the game went on the more I enjoyed the story and the creative direction that the developer and game designers took.  The game is definitely worth the purchase and play through.  I intend to play through it again to find anything I missed the first time.\r\rIf there was one thing that could have been better is the gameplay controls\\, reloading with R2 is unusual.  I usually reload guns with square.  I also got tired of the infected encounters and the AI was not very smart.  You could hide in stealth mode and 6 NPC\u2019s would see dead bodies and walk right up to the same spot for an easy kill.
