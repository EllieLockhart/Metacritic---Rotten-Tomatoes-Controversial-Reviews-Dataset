Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the fun and wonderfully nostalgic\\, yet rather disappointing Star Wars installment \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" we finally get a sequel worthy to of the Star Wars name. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a fast paced\\, non-stop\\, crush all your expectations roller coaster ride that\\, like every good second movie in a trilogy\\, drives the story further. If for no other reasons this movie is worth a watch to see one more go around for Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia and the epic return of Luke Skywalker. Luckily\\, this was just the frosting on a deliciously moist cake that Rian Johnson made for all true Star Wars fans who are willing to step outside their box and explore just what was next. Never before have we had the pleasure of seeing the force be wielded in such amazing ways and our characters be brought to life in such a human way. Johnson took the legend that we call Star Wars and made it into something real and human. We see this mostly through the character of Luke and his failures\\, which is hard to initially swallow\\, but done beautifully when brought to fruition in one of the films final sequences. While I loved the development of Rey\\, who I admitally did not like before this film\\, and Ben Solo and how their stories so wonderfully intertwined ( a true display of the dark and the light) I did find much of the rebel story line to be lacking and overemphasized. I mean how many rebel fights can we watch before it is the same thing? The comedy while great the first time may be old the more times you watch it. A couple far reaches for events that took place\\, specifically pertaining to Leia and surviving space exposure. What?!? To quote Han from episode ViI\\, \\\"That's not how the force works!\\\" Overall\\, I loved the willingness to embrace a darker tone (something missing since episode III)\\, take risks and in my opinion give us one of the best Star Wars Films made in this century! My biggest concern\\, can we trust J.J. Abrams to leave behind Force Awakens and follow up Johnson's Last Jedi with an even better conclusion? Only time will tell","true":true}
