{"101487":134510,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the movie completely speechless. I didn't know at the time if I liked the movie or hated it. The visuals were great\\, perhaps the best of any Star Wars movie\\, but after taking time to think about it\\, I realized just how bad this movie was. Here are some problems I had with the movie (SPOILERS):\\n\\n-Luke's character. At the beginning of the movie when Rey hands his light saber over to Luke\\, he throws it off the edge of the cliff. It's like a big FU to fans who have waited 2 years for this moment. It's his blue light saber\\, originally Vaders\\, that he lost in Empire when he was facing Vader. I don't think he should have this kind of reaction. And he hardly teaches Rey. He says he will teach her 3 lessons but only teaches her 1. Also\\, the worse thing about it all\\, it turns out the reason Kylo Ren turned to the darkside was because Luke sensed darkness in him and tried to kill him (he hadn't even turned to the darkside yet). This is completely against Luke's character who in Return of the Jedi refused to kill Vader just because he sensed a small amount of goodness in Vader. So\\, why would Luke want to kill his own nephew who hadn't even turned to the dark side yet? Completely against his character. Also\\, at the end of the movie\\, we see Luke coming to the planet Crait to confront Kylo Ren. It turns out that he wasn't even there in person\\, he was there as a force projection to distract Kylo Ren. He then ends up dying from exhaustion from using the force. They made Luke into a coward because he never wanted to leave the planet to confront his fears with Kylo. The real Luke wouldn't do that\\, he faced Vader in Empire and Return of the Jedi who was much more intimidating than Kylo Ren.\\n\\n-Snoke. In Force Awakens and Last Jedi\\, Snoke is portrayed as this all-powerful sith. He can use force lightning\\, read minds\\, and toss people around like rag dolls using the force. He then gets killed off within the first half of the film .We have no explanation of who he is\\, where he came from\\, how he established the First Order\\, nothing. What a waste of an interesting character.\\n\\n-Rey is a nobody and her parents are nobodies. I understand they want to create a theme that anyone can use the force\\, you don't need to have special parents. But the way they created Force Awakens with all her visions and flash backs and the way Han and Lea treated her made her seem like she was someone significant. Also\\, she has no character arc because in the Force Awakens\\, she is already good at everything and she never faces challenges or adversity. In this movie\\, there isn't much growth for Rey other than learning her parents were drunkards.\\n\\n-All the feminism. No good male characters. Luke is a failure. Poe is a crazy fly boy who needs to be put in place by dominant women. Finn is just there for comedic relief\\, his character serves no purpose. While all the female characters\\, like Rey\\, Lea\\, and Holdo have it all together and are heroic with no weaknesses. The feminist agenda is too obvious.\\n\\n-The subplot to the casino planet with wealthy people and horse racing. Finn and Rose go to a casino planet to find a hacker so they can go into the Star Destroyer and turn off the tracking system. They never found the hacker they wanted\\, and the hacker they did find was a traitor. So it was all meaningless. They just put this plot in the movie to have a political theme for animal rights and wealth inequality.\\n\\n-Lea flying through space. The First Order destroys the bridge and Lea floats out into space. She has a force moment and is still alive and she flies back to the ship like Mary Poppins. Probably one of the worse things I ever saw in Star Wars.\\n\\n-Bombers dropping bombs in space. No gravity in space\\, so this defiles the laws of physics\\, the bombs would just float\\, not drop.\\n\\n-Luke drinking milk from an aliens nipples. Again one of the worse scenes ever in Star Wars.\\n\\n-All the unanswered questions that Force Awakens left us with.\\n\\n-All the fake-outs. Looks like Luke is confronting Kylo Ren. Nope turns out he is just a force projection. Looks like Finn is going to sacrifice himself to destroy the cannon. Nope Rose stops him. They show Luke's X-Wing in the water making you think he will force lift it and fly off the planet. Nope he ends up dying on the planet. Luke will give Rey 3 lessons. Nope only 1. Looks like Rey and Kylo are going to join sides. Nope doesn't happen. It left me completely disappointed.\\n\\n-Ill-timed humor. Too many examples I don't want to list them all.\\n\\nI could go on and on listing all the problems with this movie. It is honestly the most disappointing thing I have experienced in my life. Definitely the worse Star Wars movie ever.","true":true}
