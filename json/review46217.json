Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning: Possible Spoilers\\n\\nLet's start out with the aspects of this film I liked.  The impeccably executed action sequences and overall effects lend verisimilitude to the Star Wars universe.  There are some new characters (Rose & Laura Dern's character) that are useful additions to the story.  \\n\\nThe buzz about this film before its release was that \\\"chances were taken\\\".  Chances are taken on what exactly? The lunch menu during filming perhaps?  I point this out because my single biggest disappointment with this film is that the main protagonist and antagonist both stay in their lanes so to speak.  If you take the main villain down so easily\\, it's not edgy or taking a chance.  It projects the image that this villain was just a plot device easily discarded.  It feels as though any investment in this character was a complete waste of time.  There was no threat from him from the beginning.  What we're left with in the end is an untrained \\\"Jedi\\\" and a baddie that is lacking any threat.  The former being so colorless we're forced to wonder why we're supposed to be inclined to like them.  Pertaining to the latter\\, we're more likely to die of annoyance from their whiny dialogue than to be remotely intimidated by this character.  Wait\\, they have a connection!  What a waste of an opportunity to truly take this franchise in an unexpected direction.  It failed to explore the real reasons our hero would have had to take the hand offered.  In my opinion\\, this miss-step deadens the emotional impact of key scenes. \\n\\nThe beautiful thing about Star Wars is that it will be generational.  It's 35 years after the first trilogy ended and a new trilogy has come out to ensnare a new generation of young fans spurred on by the enthusiasm of earlier generations.  For this reason\\, it was very wise of Disney to purchase this property from Lucasfilm.  30 years from now\\, one or two more trilogies (beyond the current one) will exist in the Star Wars universe.  Perhaps the present actors will come back for cameos.  There will be endless toys\\, books and graphic novels over the decades.  This franchise will be an exceptional source of income for Disney.  A verifiable tent pole in the grandest sense of the word.  Unlike any\\, the world has ever seen\\, or probably ever will see.  Sorry Avatar.\\n\\nWhich\\, much to my regret\\, brings me to my final point.  I am someone who remembers the release of \\\"Star Wars\\\" in 1977.  Although very young\\, the movie captured my imagination and sucked me into its world.  Mind\\, heart\\, and soul.  Quite simply\\, it's the epicenter of all interest and passion for the Star Wars franchise.  However\\, time waits for no one.  And as the old Persian adage reads\\, \\\"This too shall pass\\\".  As we all know\\, Hans Solo is dead.  As Luke and Leia soon bow out\\, the original reasons someone like me is anchored to this franchise get slowly chipped away.  My most significant regret is the treatment of the original characters.  Han Solo shows up\\, to put it plainly\\, to die. In regards to Leia\\, \\\"just use the f'n force already!\\\"  (Sigh!) - Luke.  Reports before the movie came out were stating that Rian Johnson's take on Luke's story was creative and original.  Bullshit.  Luke is in a convalescence home.  Waiting to die.  He gets visitors but is ultra grumpy.  Looking back into the history of the Star Wars trilogies\\, I can't help but feel this end for our intrepid adventurers is not only disappointing but has the cold\\, merciless guidance of the Disney corporate hand acting upon it.\\n\\nYes\\, you have to move the audience along to your new characters.  Disney must prepare moviegoers for the new and improved Star Wars model.  The model will consist of another original trilogy every ten years with countless other movies and novels over a decade.  I feel this is a rare miss-step for Disney.  At the core of it\\, Star Wars (the original trilogy) intrigued us.  The story enraptured a generation.  Not the special effects.  Not the toys.  Not the world building.  Star Wars was a story of trusting yourself\\, striving to improve\\, facing your greatest fears\\, and the power of redemption and family.  Disney probably felt that after the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" was successful\\, they could plan out their roadmap of merchandising and product creation.   \\nBut this just in\\, it's the Trilogy that needs to be successful.  The hand-off between the original cast and the new needed to be seamless.  The best way to ensure that was to incorporate the original characters into the current trilogy successfully.  \\n\\nRegardless of the press put out\\, there is no vision.  No master plan for this trilogy.  This should come as no surprise as Disney has had to turn to recently acquired content (Marvel\\, Lucasfilm\\, and most recent\\, Fox) to create its tentpole opportunities.  So this is what we can look forward to\\, more formulaic mega-films that are nothing more than a big name.\\n\\nOverall\\, it's an enjoyable movie.  Parts will be hard to accept for the OT fans.  However\\, this movie positions the Star Wars franchise perfectly for the coming blitzkrieg that is sure to take place over the next decade.","true":true}
