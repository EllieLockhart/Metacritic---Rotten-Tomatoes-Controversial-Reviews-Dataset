Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well well well\\, Star Wars: The second Failure they should call it.\\nI went to the cinema with so much anticipation for this movie. JJ Abrams set up some amazing plot points to be worked on like he always does. He built up some brilliant characters (Even though the lead wasn't believable or relatable in the slightest) only for Ruin Johnson to chew them up and shit them down the toilet.\\nSo\\, I'm sitting there expecting something amazing\\, I mean\\, Ruin Johnson has been awarded a whole new trilogy of his own so this must be something special right?\\nThe content of the movie has been discussed enough here\\, but I will say this\\, I checked the time on my phone about four times. The only other time I've done that is when I was forced to go to the cinema to watch Hairspray with my girlfriend because she'd watched some action movie with me.\\n\\nThe last Jedi gets 1* because I can't give it half.
