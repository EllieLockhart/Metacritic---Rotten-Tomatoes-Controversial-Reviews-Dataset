This game breaks storytelling boundaries as the first one did\\, although it forgoes the simplicity of the first game. The story feels like a eloquently written T.V Show\\, with an episodic structure. Moreover\\, The Last of Us Part II is by far Naughty Dog\u2019s largest game\\, in length and scope\\, spanning over 30 hours for my first play through. The game feels very well paced\\, albeit for the slightly prolonged ending\\, however\\, this does not detract from the true experience of the game. Additionally the gameplay system is very well done\\, with great feeling weapons\\, survival-horror like set pieces\\, that match the likes of the resident evil series\\, and calm\\, drawn out sequences that usher in a calm yet terrified feeling for the games many twists and turns are very tough to detect. Naughty Dog\\, has also gone absolutely above and beyond in their graphical fidelity of the game as well as animations. This game is by far the best looking game of the generation\\, with absolutely crisp visuals on both the standard PS4 and PS4 Pro\\, from the way water slowly darkens and muddles Ellies bags and clothes\\, to how naturally Ellie would react to her environment by sliding when she goes prone on a smooth surface\\, or put her hand against a shelf as she walks past it. Least but not least in the gameplay\\, is the gruesome melee combat\\, and although the dodge button adds quite a bit of variety to the melee systems\\, the melee combat system is very reminiscent of the first game\\, although in a good way. Each strike upon you or your enemies feels impactful\\, and heavy\\, from Ellies slashes of her switchblade\\, to the thundering thump of a pickaxe\\, melee combat never gets old with immense graphical detail from how blood splatters depending on where Ellie hits\\, to how dynamic your dodging feels. Overall this game stands up tall near the first game\\, for it offers a completely different story\\, that is much more haunting and revenge focused than the first one\\, however was a necessary evolution in Ellie and Joels relationship. I would also like to add that from viewing the leaks after completing the game\\, it seems possible as to why people were mad at the game\\, however the way Naughty Dog is able to piece the moments together turn out to be far greater than how the leaks portrayed the game. I would definitively  recommend this game whether or not you have been previously spoiled.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
