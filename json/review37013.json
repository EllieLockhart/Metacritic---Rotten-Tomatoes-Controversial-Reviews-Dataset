Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was unexpected\\, but amazing. It opens up many options for the story to go.  You don't have to be born special to be a Jedi.  You have to let go of the past.","true":true}
