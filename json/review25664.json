Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a really terrible movie but not a super great one either. Just as Force Awakens was A New Hope\\, The Last Jedi is Empire... or at least tries to be. Some of the humor falls flat. Some of the plots do too. I have to say I enjoyed Luke and Rey's plot the most. I personally didn't mind how they developed Luke for this story--quasi old gunslinger tried of\\, well\\, everything.","true":true}
