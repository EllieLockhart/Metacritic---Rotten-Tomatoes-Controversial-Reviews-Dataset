Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story and Plot - F\\nNo main plot but several sub-plots we don't need to know or care about. Story is very boring\\, confusing and hard to understand.\\n\\nDirecting - F.\\nFelt like the movie was directed by a 10 year old kid who has ADD.\\n\\nActing - C.\\nSome characters are new and don't do anything and\/or what is there purpose. Acting is nothing good - nothing bad just average.\\n\\nEditing - F.\\nThe movie should have ended at least 15-20 minutes earlier if not more. The pace of this movie is terrible.\\n\\nMusical Score - B.\\nKeeps with the tradition of previous Star Wars films.\\n\\nSpecial Effects - A.\\nGreat blend of CGI with practical effects.  Some of the best in a movie. Along with costume design and make-up.\\n\\nCinematography\/Production Design - A.\\nWell done. Looks clean and a well made film.\\n\\nOverall Score - 4.3\/10\\nToo bad the production\\, Special Effects\\, Musical Score\\, Costume Design and Make-up are not the heart and soul of a movie. In those categories; some of the best ever for a movie. However\\, it lacks a comprehensive and organize story\\, new characters one may not care about; along with no character development\\, poor directing and bad editing; that in the end makes this the worst Star Wars film to date.","true":true}
