I wish I had played a different story but that doesn't change that this revenge story was bad\\, it was really great in my opinion.\r\rThings that would have made it a 10 for me.\r\rMaybe changing the pacing. I was too impatient to get to the theatre when I was playing as Abby\\, which made me enjoying Abbys part a bit less\\, or not pay so much attention to her point of view because I was more interested in what would happen after.\r\rThe combat system became a bit tedious before the end\\, I would have been happy with a slightly shorter game.\r\rI have read some reviews and realized that people are really angry at the misleading trailers of the game. I totally sympathize with those people. I believe is not ethically right to mislead the audience\\, you either don't present any trailer or present a faithful one. I always stay away from trailers as much as possible\\, so I cant get angry for that\\, but please stop this kind of behaviour in the media industry\\, misleading is not an honest way to subvert expectations.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
