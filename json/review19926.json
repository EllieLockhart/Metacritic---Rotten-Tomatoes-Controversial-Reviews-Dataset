Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was every childish\\, definitely ruined ep 7 all that build up for nothing and I mean the part where they go find a hacker that part was 17 hours long in the movie and the first order couldn't destroy the ship that was moving really slow like hello!!? This makes me sad and don't even get me started about superman being In the movie\\, then what happens to snoke and luke its really dumb","true":true}
