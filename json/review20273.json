Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"IT WAS SO FRESH AND WONDERFUL! \\nSomethings were less powerful than other. BUT I really enjoyed it. We can't review badly a movie just because it didn't match our own expectation. They needed to take HUGE risk in other to move the world of Star War foward and they did it! This movie is meanly for kids and the messages that this movie helds are sooooo important for the next generation. To believe in themself\\, we are not defined by names or race or whatever but by the choice we make it\\, we can fall and experience failure but there is hope for everyone. This is a movie about the weight of failure and how we can make up the mistake we have done. This is\\, Beyond everything\\, the most refreshing start they could have made. The global critics are good so get over it people!!!!","true":true}
