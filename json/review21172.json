Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very excited for this movie after the Force Awakens. I even enjoyed Rogue One a lot. But after watching the Last Jedi. It left me with nothing. It was ok. But nothing. It didn't even give me enough to care that Luke Skywalker died. He probably didn't even know himself that he would die in the movie. But  well\\, yeah.. on to the next one and hope it will be as good as Force Awakens. Last Jedi? I'll just pretend it didn't happen.","true":true}
