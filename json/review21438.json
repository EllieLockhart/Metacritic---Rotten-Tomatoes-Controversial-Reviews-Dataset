Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't give any spoilers other than this movie was a hot mess that is probably the furthest thing I wanted to see as a sequel to the force awakens. This one was my least favorite star wars movie by a wide margin. Made Jar Jar seem like a breath of fresh air to me.","true":true}
