Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once we saw J.J.Abrams wasn't interested in directing future films we should of seen this bomb coming. He tried to give them a push in the right direction but it didn't work...In The Last Jedi nothing felt authentic or real. The whole movie felt like a cartoon.. Normal characters were all of a sudden able to do the impossible. Any connection to realism is thrown out the window\\, ei: Leia getting blown up\\, then sucked out into space and force flying back to safety!?  Waat?!) unneeded. Rushed character development\\, goofy looking CGI where a costumed actor should of been. Some camera angles made the actors uncomfortable to look at. \\nThe comedy relief; Holy crap was it terrible... writers didn't give a F*ck. The makers of this film settled with ideas\\, Costumes looked like they were leftover from Halloween\\, This is what happens when you make the big bucks now... RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
