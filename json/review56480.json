Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The filmmakers were trying to do too much and ended up accomplishing nothing. The film wasn't bad\\, it just wasn't good either. Some things were great\\, like the acting for instance\\, or the scenery\\, or the score. Others however weren't. Snoke was the biggest disappointment I've felt in a very long time. The way his character was handled is just tragic and self-contradictory. Also some genius came up with the great idea of introducing an underwhelming new character (Rose) and if that weren't enough\\, to devote around half an hour of the movie to following her and Finn around! And to add insult to injury\\, that arc ended up fizzling out\\, contributing nothing to the film as a whole save the admittedly brilliant Benicio del Toro. The pacing of the film also had a lot of issues.\\nThe film suffered from too high expectations following the developments teased by The Force Awakens and it just couldn't live up to them.\\nI can't honestly say that the film was bad\\, but it was definitely underwhelming and disappointing.","true":true}
