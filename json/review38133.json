Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The subplots of this movie were stupid and there were one too many bad decisions going on in it. The humor wasn't that great and I didn't care for the Finn\/Rose plot in it. This was the first Star Wars movie I rolled my eyes at a lot.","true":true}
