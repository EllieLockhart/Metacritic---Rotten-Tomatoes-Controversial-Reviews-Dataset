Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mystique is gone\\, Luke like the worst master Jedi ever\\, Ren without any training\\, Kaylo Ren hate his mask\\, cero respect with the origins\\, Luke dies?  Just for the effort..?.   Wtf.   Another legend destroy like the terrible Alien covenant.. The real empire is Disney...","true":true}
