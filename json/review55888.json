Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really great movie. Don't go in with what you want to happen\\, like all the bad reviews here seemed to. It is a really well done movie with many great twists and turns\\, and really revitalizes Star Wars\\, it isn't a repeat of what you have seen before like what some people wanted.","true":true}
