Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is certainly a film that has the highest of highs for Star Wars\\, but also some lowest of lows (well really just that Superman Leia moment). But despite being inconsistent in quality at times\\, this is a Star Wars film at the end of the day\\, and pretty damn solid one. This alone elevates it to be one of the most entertaining films of the year.","true":true}
