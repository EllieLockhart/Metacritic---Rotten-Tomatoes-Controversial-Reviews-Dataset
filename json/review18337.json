Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this new installment was puerile and pathetic.  The plot was nonsensical\\,  the acting worse than a middle school production and the big spoilers in terms of who dies and how was not just implausible but ridiculous...  if you thought in the first movie Rae being able to beat a Sith Lord was ridiculous then the big death scene in this one will be even a bigger let down.     There is no pathos in this movie\\, no plot and no purpose.     The 'professional critics' praising this movie are fake news!","true":true}
