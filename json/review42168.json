Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruins the characters of Star Wars that have been established for 40 years thru movies and countless books\/novels. This movie has some of the worse dialogue I have heard. Too many forced jokes that were lame and brought down the scene. It felt like I was watching a MCU movie with SW characters. No real character development from TFA to this movie. No real space battle nor epic light saber battle either. No questions answered that were posed from TFA. Story mission that was way too long to serve 0 purpose other than to introduce a Han Solo wannabe. Never thought I would see the day when I did not like a Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
