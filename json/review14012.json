Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you know nothing about Star Wars and lack a rudimentary understanding of physics  it is ok. Can't help but feel if this was not a Star Wars movie it would have done better.","true":true}
