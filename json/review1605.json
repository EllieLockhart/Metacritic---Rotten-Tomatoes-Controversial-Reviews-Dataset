{"101487":105205,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-08","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a longtime fan of the Star Wars Saga\\, I will say this much: I do see where other fans are coming from with their gripes with this film. However\\, I will also say this: YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THESE PROBLEMS GET TO YOUR HEAD WAY TOO MUCH. Yes\\, the film has sequences (*cough* *cough* Canto Bight) that it can do without and yes the humor does feel somewhat forced. However the rest of the film contains sequences that were not only important to move the story along\\, but necessary for the EIGHTH FILM IN THE SAGA of films in a universe that has existed for more than 40 years. Leia was using the Force to pull herself back onboard the ship\\, which is an ability that makes sense\\, given the ability to control matter that others have demonstrated with the Force. She did not freeze to death and come back to life like some are saying. She was starting to and was in critical condition when she got back to the ship. And Luke did not just disappear because he was tired like some who have watched it are saying. He had cut himself off from the Force and to create a Force projection of himself and use it the way he did would be so difficult after being closed off that it nearly killed him. After he is finally at peace with his past doings and realizing that it is his time to really move on from his past\\, he gives himself up to the Force and they become one\\, just like the way that Obi-Wan did. He went out on his own terms and the saga officially shifted from the old generation into the hands of those among the new one\\, concluding the arc of Luke Skywalker. Snoke was a red herring\\, yes\\, but his character was pivotal in setting up Kylo Ren's arc as the true big bad of this trilogy\\, using somewhat miniscule allusions to Hayden Christensen's Anakin and moments that set him up as Darth Vader in the Prequel Trilogy. Smoke was just a placeholder for Kylo Ren to take over. Rey's quest to search for answers about her parents will come to an end\\, but not here\\, because ultimately\\, that is what drives her\\, and it will need to drive her until this war has concluded. The lightsaber battles were beautifully choreographed and executed with precision. Poe's arc gladdened me as it gave him an opportunity to mature and to let others take charge once in a while. Rose and Finn's arc was odd\\, yes\\, but Rose is given a background story on Canto Bight\\, and her character is deepened just as much and far quicker as Rey and Finn. The kiss might've been unneeded\\, but this could set up a confliction arc for Finn in Episode IX. I guess we'll find out soon enough. And I'm interested in seeing how the story progresses with the Force Broom boy. All in all\\, I really enjoyed this film and I'd rank it among the top three in the saga as it was mostly unexpected\\, yet exactly what was needed to set up the final  film in the trilogy. Rian Johnson truly made this film his own installment while still honoring the legacy left behind by the previous seven episodes. I give this film 4 and a half stars.","true":true}
