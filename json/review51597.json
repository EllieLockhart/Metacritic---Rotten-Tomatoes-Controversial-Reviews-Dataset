Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actually a terrible movie. The humor was bad\\, choices people made to further the plot made no sense\\, possibly the worst plot in the history of movie making. the interaction between kylo and rey was pretty sketchy too. IMO\\, the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.","true":true}
