Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The death of Joel its ok\\, I can handle that and I were thinking he would die\\, but the form he died was terrible\\, he died with no reason and they throw him to the trash because yes\\, he deserve a better end.And other point\\, do NOT put politics in videogames and you could be thinking \u201comg he is an absolute homophobic guy and thats why he hates the game\u201d but no\\, avery single character in the game could be heterosexual and the game will be worse\\, because everyone has a determinated personality\\, since the first game Ellie has been lesbian and we Love that because its part of her personality\\, but everything you do in this game is just throw it all to the trash like Joel  and I think the developers of the game just wanted to make every one politically \u201chappy\u201d and just absolutely ignore all the fandom they had.In conclusion this game tried to be politically correct\\, but they failed to everyone specially to their fans\u2026 Expand","true":true}
