Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely epic. This film had twists and turns beyond the twists and turns. Some I knew were going to hit hard no matter what\\, others not even the craziest fan theories had envisioned. That's life. It makes for a great story and an even better film.","true":true}
