Its basically point a to b fetch quests. It brings zero innovation to the table and you have literally have done everything in this game in other games.What is absolutely terrible is the company lied to us and if you play as a certain character you are forced to kill dogs. There is another scene where the director of the game inserts himself in the game for a very lewd sex scene which is very disturbing.You really are not missing much and I recommend skipping this game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
