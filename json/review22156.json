Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Knowing well that there will always be unanswered questions\\, challenging points and questionable decisions.. I absolutely loved this movie. There is no true definition to the Force. No director will ever fit in all the scenes that audiences demand. Especially in a world where a fandom will never be satisfied. Side by side\\, this movie topped all previous Star Wars films. Acting\\, direction\\, story and more. I get to live in a world Star Wars is on big screens and this movie will help to drive the continuation of that. Truly Magical.","true":true}
