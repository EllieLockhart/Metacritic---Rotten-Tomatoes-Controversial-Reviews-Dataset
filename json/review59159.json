If you were fans of the first gameThe world of The Last of Us is a cruel\\, dangerous\\, and often exhilarating experience. Unfortunately the game is review bombed for its story. While there are several points throughout the story that the player may find disappointing\\, nothing seems forced or unreasonable. By no means does this game deserve any score lower than a 7\/10 by an average player. If you were fans of the first game please don\u2019t hesitate to give this game a try. The sense of scope and exploration has increased tenfold and the result is a beautiful and intriguing environment. However\\, if you did not enjoy the first The Last of Us\\, it\u2019s unlikely you will enjoy this sequel. That being said\\, story sequels like this generally improve upon the first game\u2019s vision rather than completely altering the formula. In that sense this game has succeeded spectacularly. While there are some issues with game mechanics that I wish could be altered it does not detract majorly from the game experience. The game is not perfect\\, but it is not only playable but enjoyable. Anyone who gives this game a 0-5\/10 is not doing an accurate job at a critical review. If you feel like you want to pick this game up\\, then you should.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
