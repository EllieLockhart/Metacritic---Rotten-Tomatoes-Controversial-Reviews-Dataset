Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Cinematography and Acting. If you like plot twists and things that contradicts the Previous Star Wars Movies. \\nThen you'll love this","true":true}
