Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked that Last Jedi subverted expectations the way it did; in that it was unlike any previous Star Wars movie (excepting possibly Empire). All the hate being spewed and manipulating to bring down the fan rating is frankly silly and ridiculous. My main issue was that the movie was indeed way too long; it would have been tighter cut down to two hours or less. I may return to update this review after I've seen it a second time\\, but it was a really good movie. Now let the hate spew forth at me for liking it\\, lol.","true":true}
