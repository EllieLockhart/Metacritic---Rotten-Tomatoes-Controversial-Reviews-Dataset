Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie and think it might be the strongest film in the Star Wars saga\\, even though my feels tell me it can't be #1 because I still remember watching the twin suns of Tatooine rise as a child. \\n\\nFor my money\\, this might be the best made movie of the series because it introduced an expansive new cast\\, dug deep into the real conflict of Rey and Kylo Ren\\, answered questions\\, left mysteries\\, and made the most mature attempt to deal with themes of light and dark of any movie in the franchise. \\n\\nLoved it. Seeing it again.","true":true}
