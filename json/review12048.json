Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually feel kind of sorry for people who don't enjoy this movie. Guess they just need to let the past die (kill it\\, if you have to).\\n\\nJoking aside\\, this is easily the best Star Wars film since Empire. Every other Star Wars film post Empire tries too hard to please its rabid fans\\, and instead of leaning into that like past creators\\, Rian Johnson actually sets out to tell a cohesive and nuanced character-driven story. Of course\\, this franchise is meant for children\\, so there's a fair bit of slapstick humor and product placement for Disney to make money--but the story itself is excellent. I'm excited to see what Johnson will do with his future Star Wars trilogy\\, where his vision will be less hampered by the the chapter(s) preceding and following it (looking at you\\, TFA and TROS... yikes).","true":true}
