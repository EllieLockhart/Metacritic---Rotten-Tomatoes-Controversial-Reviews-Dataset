Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solid movie after seeing it a second time.  My initial impression was one of disappointment.  However\\, after seeing it again\\, I'm more inclined to understand what RJ had intended.  Obviously there are some plot holes\\, but overall I found it to be quite entertaining.  I actually enjoyed the methodical approach in trying to lure Luke into the conflict.  Overall\\, I give it a solid B.","true":true}
