Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will start out\\, like others have\\, by reminding everyone that 1\/2 stars don't count.\\n\\nThis movie is nothing less than a cataclysmic monstrosity. Rian Johnson\\, do you think that putting a twist at literally every turn in a movie is good film making? NO! The inebriated slicer guy for example: \\\"I'm a jerk who's going to help you if you give me your family necklace. JK!! I'm actually a good guy because I just needed for a second to slice stuff. JK!! I'm a bad guy cause I sold you out. Woopsie daisy guess I blew up and that whole side story literally did NOTHING to move the world's longest and slowest space chase along in an already cringe worthy film. You lack every sense of good storytelling.  You have as much cohesiveness as dry rice\\, and you insult the actors\\, the fans\\, and a true legacy with this piece of garbage. When literal BILLIONS of dollars go into a MOVIE\\, there is no excuse for lacking basic elements. And disney\\, if yo want us to purchase your stupid visual dictionaries to fill in plot holes and unanswered questions that were supposed to be answered after 2 years of waiting and speculating\\, you're out of your egotistically inflated minds. To those who rate the movie highly\\, give me actual reasons to believe you instead of the repetative \\\"Ohhh RJ took risks and it's soooo bold and refreshing\\,\\\" or \\\"Ohhhh hyper space tracking was planned all along so 5\/5.\\\" Everybody along with myself who hated this have reasoning behind them\\, if you write a review\\, you are trying clearly trying to persuade people\\, so do yourself a favor and actually make some points. I could go on and on regarding the specifics\\, but my fellow reviewers (good on them) have covered this multiple times on almost every page of reviews.\\n\\nIn regards to the social PSAs? This movie I feel became sexist by trying so soooo hard not to be sexist.  Rey should have to undergo painful trials\\, and know the blood sweat and tears it takes to reach inner peace or be able to wield power.  Instead you insult the female protagonist by making everything easy on her from birth given perfection in the force\\, birth given righteousness\\, and sad excuses for enemies. \\n\\nFrom the bottom of my aching heart\\, Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Disney\\, you disgust me. Next time you are given billions of dollars for a movie (hopefully never again)\\, go donate it to the hungry and in need.\\n\\nAnd seriously\\, 91% with the CRITICS?? I don't buy it. If you are trying to manipulate people into thinking this movie is somehow profound or good in any way\\, you're more pathetic than","true":true}
