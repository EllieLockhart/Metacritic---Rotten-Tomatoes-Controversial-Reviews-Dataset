Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think anything could be worse than the force awakens but of boy was i wrong. The plot is so shallow and boring apparently the first order magically rules the galaxy now. The amount of unfunny childish humor is dreadful. every character is shallow and uninteresting with no story\\, the whole finn and rose subplot was terrible and dragged the movie down\\, also they added unnecessary politics into the movie about how capitalism is bad and the rich are bad and animal abuse\\,\\, etc.  They completely ignore all the star wars lore and just break common logic. Rey is still a magical disney mary sue princess who can do anything without any training or any knowledge of the force. like she lifts like 3 tons of rocks at the end of the movie..... i could go on for paragraphs explaining all the plot holes and flaws but i would be writing paragraphs and i don't think this movie deserves this time and effort. what a joke avoid this movie at all costs.","true":true}
