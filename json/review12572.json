Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't easily express how disappointing a film this actually is\\, I never thought that I would watch a Star Wars film worse than the fantom menace. This film is generally visually pretty (as long as you don't include the aweful looking side quest to the casino planet) which is 1 star. The other star is for an ok musical score. The acting is generally mediocre but this may not be a reflection on the actors just the lackluster writing. The plot is seriously poor and I did laugh out loud in a couple of places (mainly at the Mary Poppins princess Leia scene). I unfortunately paid to watch this after missing most of the criticism \/reviews and now rather regret having funded this poor excuse of a Star Wars film. It should be very easy to make a great Star Wars film  with the vast resources at Disney and the huge wealth of great stories already out there.","true":true}
