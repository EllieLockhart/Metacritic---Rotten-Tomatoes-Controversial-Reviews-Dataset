Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie overall was good. I liked the characters Finn and Rose but their subplot was the weakest part of the movie. I also didn't like Leia using the force and surviving in space. I know Carrie Fisher is now dead and the movie tried to be a tribute to her but her character should have died right there. Kylo Ren and Rey were very good characters and I loved Snoke's demise. I didn't think Luke's portrayal was too unfaithful\\, I would have changed some things but overall I thought it was good. I enjoyed the movie and I'm excited to see what the next one holds.","true":true}
