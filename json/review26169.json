Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not since Phantom Menace has a Star Wars movie been so dissapointing. They offer fans beauty and amazing reunions\\, but they offer movie goers tropes\\, deus ex machinas and plot-holes. From Princess Lea's unexplained space flights to every character being saved inexplicably (Finn on some rising something after being thrown off a ledge)\\, the movie thinks it's audience is stupid and will look past the faults just to see a Luke and Lea reunion. I don't recall disagreeing with critics so much!","true":true}
