Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin. The first half was filled with messy poor transitioned jump cuts. Incredibly forgettable characters\\, poorly written stories undercut by half baked comedy\\, introducing aspects for convenience sake without any thought to it. I'll at least say the fight choreography was great ad stunning visuals but every amount of actual movie creation besides that was drivel. I would have given this 1 star\\, but the end scene on the salt planet was actually well done. everything else was just bad. So much of these reviews are people looking at this movie through rose-colored lenses and nostalgia because\\, just like the force awakens\\, it's mostly poorly hashed together aspects of previous films. Disney's cash cow is getting even worse somehow. I went in with low expectations and they somehow made an even worse movie","true":true}
