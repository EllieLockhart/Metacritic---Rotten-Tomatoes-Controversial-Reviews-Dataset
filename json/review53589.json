Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Star Wars film.\\n\\nThe evolving relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is taken in a bold and unexpected direction\\, really fascinating and very well done\\, these two characters are the beating heart of the film. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley hit their performances out of the park.\\n\\nNew character Rose and Finn have an interesting journey of their own\\, which includes a poignant commentary on the nature of war.\\n\\nLuke's journey is unorthodox but ultimately satisfying\\, Leia is amazing in this film and she finally displays force powers which is long overdue for that character. \\n\\nPoe Dameron is portrayed as not just the one dimensional hero and ace pilot from The Force Awakens but an\\, at times\\, reckless warrior and a flawed man.\\n\\nThe space battles are the best of the series\\, each character's journey is balanced\\, trim and the film deftly cuts between them. Snappily paced\\, the film is 2 and a half hours but feels shorter and left me wanting more.\\n\\nThe climax of the film with Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, Snoke and the Praetorian Guard    is absolutely jaw-dropping\\, second best of the Star Wars series I'd say\\, second to only the \\\"I am your father\\\" scene in 'The Empire Strikes Back.'\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a great experience all the way around.","true":true}
