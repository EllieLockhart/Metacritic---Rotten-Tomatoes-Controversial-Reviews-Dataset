Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a great sequel. What people are not understanding is it is time to set a new. bury the past and find out more levels of the force. I love the direction it's going and can't wait to see how the force unfolds to newer heights.","true":true}
