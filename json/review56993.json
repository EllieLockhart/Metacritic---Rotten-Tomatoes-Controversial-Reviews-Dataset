Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They had SO MUCH to work with in this movie\\, and they wasted EVERYTHING\\, even the 3 main characters\\, who were treated badly in this movie.\\n\\nPeople complained that Rey was a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" in TFA but the mistery about her background kept thins in suspension and people guessing\\, and this film only reinforced those claims. It seems that the creators DIDN'T WATCH STAR WARS before joining the production because every knowledge established about the Force was thrown into the fire along with every aspect of Luke's personality.\\n\\nHan Solo was well written in TFA because it was written by someone who knew very well who Han is: the same writer and wrote the character in Empire\\, and we see the full opposite with Luke.\\nLuke was gone even before the movie started\\, and the thing we saw was the desecration of the body. \\nConsidering to kill his own nephew\\, after all that happened in the originals? And the explanation was something that Lucas would never consider doing\\, despite all the horrible things some fans said about him in all these years.\\nLuke\\, after completing his journey and achieving greatness\\, is now a coward and also a failed nephew killer.\\n\\nWe also see Leia being Superman\\, aside from the RIDDICULOUS IDEA EVER that was her survival\\, using the force without any explanation and everyone on the ship treating it so naturally...\\nNo one had questions? did everyone knew what she was capable of? and if they were\\, why don't we??\\n\\nFor Disney\\, everyone who is force-sensitive can use the force without any sort of training or knowledge about its usage or possibilities\\, and we are supposed to accept that without any reaction other than applause: It's like saying that \\\"everyone can play the piano without practice and\/or lessons\\\".\\n\\nMy suspension of disbelief has not withstood these gigantic mistakes\\, and so I believe this is the worst film in the whole franchise.\\n\\nI miss George Lucas' way of making movies\\, despite all of his limitations with dialogue and what a 20-year-time lapse is (you know what I mean)\\, he made the saga with his heart and soul\\, he know how to tell a story in movies\\, and we all love them for what they were and what they are\\, what they mean to him and to us.\\n\\nI love you\\, George Lucas\\, and i'm so sorry for how things turned out.\\nStar Wars died with the sale to Disney.\\n\\n\\nand people and critics: stop lying about the movie quality.\\nI'm not saying that you cannot enjoy it\\, but don't dismiss the problems as if they don't exist: you are doing more harm than good for the industry.","true":true}
