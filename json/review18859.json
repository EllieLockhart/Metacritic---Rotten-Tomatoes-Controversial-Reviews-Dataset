Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as you were as Rey is trying to find Luke to teach her the way of the Jedi. Along the way she reaches out to Kylo Ren to try and get him to come to the light\\, as he tries to lure Rey to the dark side. Some good action scenes\\, although they all seemed a bit repetitive. A few extra jokes added into the usual mix\\, a nod to Marvel maybe? Overall enjoyable\\, not the best but probably not the worse. Expected more but still worth a watch 7\/10","true":true}
