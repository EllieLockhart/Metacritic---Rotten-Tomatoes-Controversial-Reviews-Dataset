Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie.  I came in with an open mind and was overall disappointed.  The visual effects were good but the story was lacking and the characters lacked development.  Rey is an unstoppable force (no training)\\, Luke and Leia are just there for nostalgia.  Snope is a by-line\\, Kylo is kid trying to fill Vader's shoes but is really bad at it.   The chase scene was so dumb\\, why not just hyperspace part of your fleet ahead of them?  Oh and if you could destroy their biggest ship by just hyperspacing a ship into it why not do it earlier (what no one thought of that before?)  Hell why didn't someone just hyperspace through the deathstar if that's all it takes.   I hated the rebel admirals.  What the hell were they thinking having Leia fly through space like a witch???  Captain Phasma huge disappointment.    Also\\, how was the rebellion so small???   What happened between ROTJ and the force awakens that caused every planet to say we're just going to let the Empire take us over again.  Some of the lines and scenes were funny but there were too many that seemed forced.  I honestly would have preferred that everyone die at the end of the movie except for Poe\\, I kind of liked Poe.","true":true}
