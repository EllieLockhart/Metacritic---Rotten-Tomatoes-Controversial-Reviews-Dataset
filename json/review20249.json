Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was quite entertaining. Yet\\, the movies contain many plot holes and nonsense\\, like how come an unconcious Leia floating in space managed to use the FORCE to get back to the ship\\, how Rose and when Rose fall in love with a coward Finnn\\, and many disney type jokes which I find unnecessary.  Overally\\, a dissapointed waiting","true":true}
