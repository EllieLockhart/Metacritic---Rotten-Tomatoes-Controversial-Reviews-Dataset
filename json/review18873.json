Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's appropriate that most of the action takes place on the bridge of two spaceships and the plot is centered around the bridge between Kylo and Rey\\, because the entirety of this film serves as a mere bridge to the next installment in the franchise. But\\, this bridge is a beautiful\\, well-constructed one. You can perhaps find fault that the bridge is slightly too long and has too much congestion on the front end\\, but by the home stretch\\, it's a free-flowing highway that you can't help but want to speed towards the exit just to see how it ends.","true":true}
