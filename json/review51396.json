Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolute trash\\, \\ncan't be bothered to re-write all the appaling writing in this film so to listen to everything that winds me up about this film\\, watch '10 things I hate about the Last Jedi' by Angry Joe on youtube\\, a bunch of die hard star wars fans absolutely gutted with this film who spend an hour explaining why it was so disappointing","true":true}
