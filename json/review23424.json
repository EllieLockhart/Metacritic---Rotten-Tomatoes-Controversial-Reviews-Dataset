Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved\\, loved loved Star Wars The Last Jedi. Fun\\, funny\\, and exciting! One thing I noticed was the Phasma's armor actually protected her from a laser blast ... whereas the regular Stormtroopers armor provides absolutely Zero protection. Sounds like the empire and first order were diverting funds to their planet killing devices and reducing the money spent on protecting their soldiers. Already bought tickets to go see it again tomorrow morning at 7am with the family! Galactic good times!","true":true}
