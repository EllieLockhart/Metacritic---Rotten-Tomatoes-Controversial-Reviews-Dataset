Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker was my hero growing up.  I am a huge Star Wars fan for 40+ years.  I did not like this movie.  I agree with Mark Hamill: \\\"This is not my Luke Skywalker.\\\"  Disney made an ugly Star Wars movie\\, and I've lost faith in them as stewards of the franchise.  I was excited for Rian Johnson's trilogy.  Now I'm not.  Ditto for Episode 9. I had quibbles with Force Awakens\\, but it seems like JJ understood Star Wars.  What a disappointment.  I am still upset a week after seeing it.","true":true}
