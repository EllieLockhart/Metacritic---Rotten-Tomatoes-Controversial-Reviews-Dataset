Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pure piece of crap. They were trying to literally anger the fanbase. The Force Awakens was much better\\, and the prequel and OT are millions of times better. I don't mind Rey being a girl. I don't mind diverse characters. But I do mind them trashing Luke\\, killing Snoke with no explanation\\, and just generally taking a steaming dump on the fans. ","true":true}
