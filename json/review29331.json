Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and the Disney mafia have achieved their goal. They are absolutely right; this is not my Star Wars. I was there for the original in 1977 and was a fan ever since. George Lucas always aimed to make movies that were inspired by heroic myths and movie serials that could be enjoyed by all. While the results were sometimes mixed (Prequels anyone?)\\, his films always had a sense of wonder and awe as well as a true spirit of heroism. Toss all of that out for prank phone calls\\, established heroes betraying their core values\\, and whole lot of not really accomplishing anything and you have the Last Jedi.        \\n\\nEven worse\\, is that the plot in this movie is embarrassingly stupid. While Star Wars has never been Godfather level storytelling\\, it has never been so lazy\\, illogical\\, internally inconsistent or downright insulting before. Congrats again Johnson and company - you have made the prequels look brilliant in comparison!     \\n\\nSo much to say\\, but it all boils down to just a terrible movie by any measure.","true":true}
