Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is fantastic. I love every moment with the new character Rose. The fights are amazing\\, and the expansion into the force lore is wonderful. I really enjoyed how these characters interacted with eachother. Balance is the key.","true":true}
