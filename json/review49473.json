Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Would have been fine as a non Star Wars movie but displays an antipathy for the morality and characters of the original trilogy that makes it terrible to watch.  If you never loved the originals then fine\\, maybe you can like this for the explosions.  But it makes no sense in the galaxy it pretends to inhabit.  Maybe they can do a fast and furious 12 with a star wars crossover to let the jedi ghosts deathrace each other.","true":true}
