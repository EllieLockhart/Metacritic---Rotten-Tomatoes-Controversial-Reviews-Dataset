Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was just a complete mash of grandiose Star Wars plotlines all thrown together. The unsuccessful search for ones parents\\, the internal struggle of identity\\, the balance of good and evil\\, the return of dead or previous characters\\, every character is either pure and good that they are self sacrificial while the enemies are dumb lug nuts and incredibly predictable. I mean I remember in the original trilogy when ONE plot line or cliff hanger was enough to suspend and hold our interest til the next movie. Like when Luke does battle with Vader in ESB and finds out his identity. One of cinemas most climatic scenes ever!!! I guess with Disney at the helm every thing has to end in a parade. Other issues such as undeveloped characters you don't care about having to much screentime\\, unexplained history of main characters (Snoke)\\, lasers galore and cheesy one liners\\, not to mention the complete relegation of prestige Luke Skywalker was gives(seriously one of the most iconic characters in scifi and thats hows you do him...) I really wanted to enjoy the film but Disney and the writers have truly transformed our beloved adult science-fiction to childish fairytales..","true":true}
