Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was not the film I expected\\, but I was very surprised and pleased with what I got. One of my big fears with this new trilogy was that the Lucasfilm story group would repeat the mistakes of the old Extended universe and refuse to pass the torch to the new generation. As fun as it is to watch the old characters run around\\, the reality is that it has been 40 years since A New Hope\\, and the next generation needs to take center stage. I was delighted to see that this film does just that\\, allowing the new characters to get the character development they needed to become the new leaders\\, as well as allowing the old characters to pass on what they have learned.\\n\\nThe plot takes a little while to settle into place\\, and there is a sub-plot that goes on for a tad to long\\, but those are highly forgivable flaws\\, especially in a franchise that has a history of poor screen time management. \\n\\nVery excited to see where the story goes next.","true":true}
