Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sucks!\\, I want my money back!\\, I was so upset and angry after seeing this movie!. I can clearly see they are passing stars wars on to a new cast\\, unfortunately the new cast is not good enough I don't see any chemistry or movie  magic from any of the new characters. I am extremely disappointed of how they have destroyed our beloved Luke Skywalker\\, he deserves much more. I should of have stopped watching when Han Solo died!\\, I will no longer be watching another Star Wars movie as this one has completely taken my heart out and stepped on it. Good Bye star wars may you rest in peace.","true":true}
