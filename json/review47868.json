Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where was the epic fight scene that Luke Skywalker deserved? The movie dragged in parts but failed to give the backstory to some of the characters. At the end of the day it's a Star Wars movie worth seeing","true":true}
