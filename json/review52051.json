Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After much digestion time I have decided I hate this movie and wanted to add my list to the growing numbers here on rottentomatoes.  No way this is a 94% fresh movie\\, it was a mess.  If you were disgusted like me add your voice so Disney won't repeat the mistakes made in TLJ","true":true}
