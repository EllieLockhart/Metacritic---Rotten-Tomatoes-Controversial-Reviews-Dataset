Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the perfect movie for a parent to take a child to\\, creating a new generation of fans. Older nerds like me wont care for it. The family friendly humor seemed forced throughout the movie\\, it's like they ignored all character development from 4 5 6 and I found myself not giving a crap about all the characters save one (the chick) and that was only so... it would have been better if they made a whole new story that was based on the history of the old ones\\, that way I probably won't be as critical. I love Star Wars and was disappointed.","true":true}
