Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much unfair\\, angry criticism. So much good stuff in this film\\, and the subplots were NOT inconsequential! If Poe had not gone on that mission it would have HELPED the rebellion\\, and the character work was so important as it made the action scenes worth so much more ultimately.","true":true}
