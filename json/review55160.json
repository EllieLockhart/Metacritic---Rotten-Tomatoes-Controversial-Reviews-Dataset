Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie convinced it was going to be one of my favorite Star Wars movies ever\\, honestly. \\nTo me\\, this movie felt like Rian Johnson didn't know what to do with what was put in place in VII\\, and therefore took brutal decisions. \\nSnoke? I don't want to work on his story\\, let's kill him\\, screw your hopes for a more fleshed out\\, powerful Palpatine. \\nPhasma? That's not going anywhere\\, let's give her 3 more minutes of screen time and kill her (I didn't care at all but I know a lot of people wanted more from the character). \\nKnights of Ren? Meh\\, look at my cool red guards\\, that will still be all killed in this movie. \\nExplain Rey's abilities in TFA? Nah\\, that's just how the Force works now\\, she actually never had any training as a child and you need to accept it. \\nOh and you have been waiting decades to see Luke ignite his \\\"actual\\\" lightsaber again? I'll just give it to you in a weird flashback where he doesn't fight. Not even his illusion will wield his green lightsaber (which could have been white to make it extra awesome). Plus now he is dead so forget any hope you had. \\nOh and btw now Force ghosts can have actual physical interactions with their surroundings\\, as in make lightning happen and hit Luke on the head with a (ghost) cane. \\nThe Rose and Finn story arc was awful and useless\\, and kept the audience from spending more time learning about the Kylo\/Snoke dynamic\\, or seeing Rey actually train to give some weight and justification to her abilities\\nEverything was about subverting expectations and spread out of place messages instead of actually giving fans the movie they deserved\\, after all this wait\\, all the money spent.\\nThis was an OK movie\\, but a really\\, really weird and bad Star Wars movie with decisions that were way too extreme. I get that they wanted \\\"different\\\"\\, this is too different though\\, they missed the sweet spot.?","true":true}
