Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Me encanto la pelicula\\, tiene muchas referencias a peliculas anteriores\\, personajes mejor desarrollados que en el episodio anterior\\, es preferible ver los episodios anteriores antes de verla para entender bien las referencias sino podrias pensar que hay huecos argumentales.","true":false}
