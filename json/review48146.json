Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the visual effects are amazing and visually stunning\\, the same can not be said for the story. The movie doesn't add anything to the star wars lore\\, in fact does the opposite and destroys several ideas behind the first six movies and series such as the clone wars. The movie plot is lazy and disappointing. They just miss the opportunity to have created a great movie.","true":true}
