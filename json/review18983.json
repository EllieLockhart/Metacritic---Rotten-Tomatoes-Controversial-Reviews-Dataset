Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. All the good things that JJ Abrahams put on Ep 7\\, rian Johnson made all the efforts to delete. The movie itself doesn't respect a lot of 'rules' that the rest of the saga have. All that nonsense '''jokes'''\\, the thing with the Rey parents\\, the knigths of Ren\\, the origin of snoke\\, the entire way the movie treat the character of Luke. Etc etc","true":true}
