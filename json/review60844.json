Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"(I have played and finished this game)First off I want to express that this game is not terrible\\, it\u2019s bad but not terrible. The graphics are great and the visuals are amazing which is why I gave it a four\\, but that\u2019s not all that goes into a game of this caliber. By all means I am not a professional critic and have no experience but excuse my language but a depressed clown with a stick in its ass is more entertaining than most of this game. I say most because the prologue was in my opinion beautiful when Joel sings and give Ellie the guitar\\, I geared up a bit. Then they did a stupid time jump to speed the process of Joel\u2019s idiotic death. This game is so repetitive with the way it\u2019s played and goes way off the rails of the first game which is loved by most people who played it. If the game stuck to the character developing moments like the Future Days cover by Joel to Ellie then I would rate this a 10\/10 and writing this I am hopeful that the retcon this game or makes Joel Edition where he doesn\u2019t die and does work on the relationship of Ellie and Joel. They are making a TV show as well for this game which I am really excited but I just don\u2019t want them to mess this up like TLOU2 and cast the right actors for these roles( I personally would choose Hugh Jackman and Kaitlyn Denver\u2019s) Thank you for reading this if you did:)\u2026 Expand","true":true}
