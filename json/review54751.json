Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I should start out by saying that I have always loved Star Wars\\, despite the prequel trilogy and the last half hour of Force Awakens. While the beginning sequence of the movie was fantastic\\, the film quickly devolved into borderline unwatchable dreck. There would be the occasional entertaining scene along the way\\, but not nearly enough positives to outweigh the glaring negatives. Mark Hamill acted the hell out of the PTSD Luke Sykwalker\\, but I felt that the story did his character and the Skywalker legacy a serious injustice. Additionally\\, many of the character decisions were head-scratching and seemed to mostly be devices to serve the advancement of the plot more than actually making sense. I was hoping for a return to Star Wars glory\\, but this wasn't even on par with Revenge of the Sith (which somehow pulled down a 79% 'Certified Fresh' on the infamous tomatometer) than even being in the same stratosphere as A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back. I had previously enjoyed Rian Johnson's work on such films as Looper and Brick\\, but now he's going to get an entire Star Wars trilogy of his own? That's unfortunate. This is not a movie that needs to be seen in theaters\\, and to be honest\\, not really seen at all. Just watch Rogue One\\, A New Home\\, Empire Strikes Back\\, Return of the Jedi (which has its own flaws\\, but still works on the most part)\\, and the first 90 minutes of The Force Awakens. I don't think I can stomach viewing this catastrophe ever again.","true":true}
