Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me it is simple\\, it is the movie that I liked the least in the saga. They have a fantastic villain who does not take advantage enough and the plot has a lot of gaps.","true":true}
