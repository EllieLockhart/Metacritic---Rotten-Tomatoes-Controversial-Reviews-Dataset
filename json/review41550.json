Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is everything I wanted from the continuation of this saga it honours the past perfectly and take luke in an unexpected but correct directions that when thought about follows the progression of the saga from episode one of how the force should be interpreted. The performances are brilliant oscar Issac begins to clearly slip into a more of a Han Solo type role but makes clear development as to his view of leadership\\, every memeber of the new cast is fantastic daisy Ridley continues to impress and is IN NO WAY a Mary Sue\\, Adam Driver is brilliant and presets possibly the most realistic grounded and complex villains Star Wars has ever had. But Mark Hamill stand out most giving the performance of his career as a broken tired and hopeless man who through Rey rediscovers his hope for the galaxy.\\nFor those who say TLJ is too Disney and not a real Star Wars film....I don't know what to say\\, no it is not the original trilogy\\, it New and different but retains a familiar feel of the originals\\nPeople need to listen to message of the film\\, it's a film about \\\"letting the past die\\\" while honouring the transition but also embracing the new\\, and as far as I'm concerned 'the new' is exciting and full of potential and I can't wait for episode IX.\\nIf you love Star Wars and are open to something a little different you will love this film","true":true}
