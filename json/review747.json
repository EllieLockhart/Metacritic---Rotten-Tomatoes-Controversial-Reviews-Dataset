Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"And this is how I know critics aren't worth listening to. Just what is there to like in this movie? The new characters are unlikable\\, the story is extremely inconsistent and old favorites no longer represent what they used to. Plus\\, Rey hasn't really improved as a character and other characters like Finn and Poe seem to have gotten worse over the course of this movie. And Rose? Holdo?? What was Rian Johnson thinking when he wrote this pile of feces?! This was just incredibly bad\\, and I personally recommend avoiding anything touched by LucasFilms and Rian Johnson in the future if you have anything that resembles 'taste'.\\n\\n Also\\, for some reason EVERYTHING I type in the text editor is in all caps. Unless my computer's Caps Lock is broken\\, RT might want to check their site.","true":true}
