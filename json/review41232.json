Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a huge disappointment.  The main storyline makes no sense\\, there is little or no character development and the biggest thing that happens in the movie is poorly handled.  Force Awakens left you wanting more\\, at this more\\, I say no mas.","true":true}
