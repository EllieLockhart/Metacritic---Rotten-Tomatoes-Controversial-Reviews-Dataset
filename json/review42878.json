Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was.....really not quite as good as 7 :\/ The setup and personalities in previous film was mostly discarded. Then there was a really large romance adventure segment that developed a character with literally nothing that comes out of it. It was SO jarring in middle of everything\\, reminds me of Lucas's special cuts in original trilogy.\\nThe philosophy of light and dark was done really well though\\, about the only good part in the film :\/","true":true}
