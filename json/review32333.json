Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars has taken the The Lord of the Rings route\\, and it was a great decision. Always grandiose\\, always epic and\\, admittedly\\, always too long. Still\\, Star Wars is today the most magnificient franchise to ever exist. Audiences are divided\\, but it is time to take a look at the bigger picture.  I know what they say\\, \\\"if it ain't broke\\, don't fix it!\\\" But for how long can we enjoy a franchise that feels exactly like the same movie over and over? The Last Jedi was a bold choice\\, but not a step in the opposite direction; and Rian Johnson did not throw the classic formula out the x-wing's window. He gave it a new life. I stand by The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson's voice\\, the proof is the goosebumps I've still got all over me. What an spectacle.","true":true}
