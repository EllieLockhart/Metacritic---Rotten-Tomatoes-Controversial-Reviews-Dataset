Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A friend told me I need to see it again to fully understand it. However\\, I believe I'm not that stupid yet (that's how you feel when people say you didn't get it). Besides\\, I used to see Star Wars films several times in the movie theater because I LIKED them and ENJOYED watching them over and over again. I never had to return to the cinema to UNDERSTAND the films.\\n\\nI've also read some who enjoyed the film saying \\\"the problem is that you went to the cinema with very high expectations\\\". Well\\, I didn't  want it to be an art film nor was I expecting anything else than having a good time with the saga that used to make me happy. And let's be honest! Isn't it sad and mediocre to ask people to do something they enjoy without expectations.\\n\\nAnd yet\\, the feeling when I left the theater was so bad. I felt so disgusted and disappointed. I won't spoil anything here but I'll just say this so-called genius Rian Johnson\\, destroyed on my childhood heroes and simply says \\\"sorry guys\\, I had to\\\".\\n\\nIf you liked the movie\\, good for you. If like me\\, you didn't. Well\\, I guess it's time to tell Disney we won't be supporting this new view anymore. If you don't even like Star Wars\\, please don't spend your money in Disney.","true":true}
