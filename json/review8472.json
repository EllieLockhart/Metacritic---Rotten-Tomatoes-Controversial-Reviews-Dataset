Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got to see Last Jedi after successfully avoiding spoilers for two weeks and I was rewarded with a great entry into the series! The negative reviews seem to be from people who wanted something they did not get. I let the storyteller tell the story and enjoyed their story. Can't wait for Nine!","true":true}
