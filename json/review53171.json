Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Based on seeing this movie... I don't believe I'll ever go to the cinema to watch another Star Wars ever again. So\\, so\\, SO many plot holes and \\\"I don't understand how\\, or why\\, or what just happened\\, this makes no sense\\\"\\n\\nI've thought long and hard about the 'positive' reviews out there and can't understand how they concluded 5 star reviews. Sure if they ignore 5 to 8 gaping plot holes\\, poor humor almost throughout (about 2 jokes land)\\, 4 or 5 lucky coincidences that help drag the story along (I mean seriously what was the point going to the casino planet just to get imprisoned\\, just to meet a random person that you're not looking for\\, who might help\\, but doesn't)\\, ignore turning BB-8 into a crap clowny character with gold coin machine gun \/ smashing its head into computer to fix it \/ to bumbling into walls whilst undercover...\\n\\nI want to go on but there's just too many moments that make this a terrible movie. Even if it wasn't Star Wars\\, but it is which makes this even worse. Honestly trying to be objective as possible but I can't work out why anyone would think this is worth more than 3 stars... unless they were asleep for 85% of the movie","true":true}
