Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really don\u2019t understand all the hate for this movie. It was excellent! Great action. Fantastic character moments. I never knew what to expect. Luke Skywalker was incredible. Don\u2019t be influenced by the people trying to tear it down. See it for yourself. If you like Star Wars I don\u2019t think you will be disappointed.","true":true}
