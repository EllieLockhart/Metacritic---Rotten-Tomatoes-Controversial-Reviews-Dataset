Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look\\, The Force Awakens wasn't perfect. But where it did succeed was in creating some very good new characters and setting up some intriguing plot threads for its sequels to follow.\\n\\nWhat TLJ does\\, rather flippantly\\, is blow every single one of those plot threads out of the water\\, in a way that almost mocks the viewer for caring about them in the first place. Then\\, it makes a few bold character choices\\, but then bafflingly doubles back on them and erases them like 5 minutes later (the Leia scene\\, the entire Rey\/Kylo thread).\\n\\nWhat we're left with at the end of TLJ is two-thirds of a trilogy that is completely redundant\\, and a playing field that has been totally wiped clean. I don't even understand why they would need to make an Episode 9 at this point. I'm just baffled at the choices that were made here.","true":true}
