{"101487":109920,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than force awakens for sure\\, but still not the star wars ive grown to love\\, I like all the back story\\, but not much fighting.. Snoke killed off too soon and easily\\, could have been an amazing plot twist to find out he was someone from original star wars universe so that was a HUGE WASTE. Luke skywalker was VASTLY MISS WRITTEN. Also why did luke just up and die after tricking kylos mind?? like really..I also understand that the plot of the movies but I really miss all the jedi and sith story lines\\, they were always awesome.Between the movies (other than rogue one) and battlefront game series I feel like im watching a dog be put down slowly.. But as they say I still have a spark of hope for the other three movies to be directed on a completely diffrent storyline.","true":true}
