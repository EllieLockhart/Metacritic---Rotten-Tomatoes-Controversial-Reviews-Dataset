Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a good movie! Every film has it's flaws\\, and this one did as well\\, but it was definitely enjoyable and most of the people mad about it just seem to be upset that their theories weren't true. This had incredible scenes and beautifully cinematic moments that shouldn't be overlooked by angry fanboys. If anything\\, this film got me more excited for Episode 9.","true":true}
