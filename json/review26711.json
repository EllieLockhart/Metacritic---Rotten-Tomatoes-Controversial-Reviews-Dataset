Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok so there were good things and bad things. People are giving this movie crap for its comedy...Why it\u2019s not like Star Wars is a marvel movie\\, I personally thought it was a great Star Wars flick...but there was one thing that made me give it a 4 instead of a 4 1\/2 stars that one thing is (SPOILERS) When princess leiga survives the cockpit blast when she uses the force to survive like seriously come up with something else and when the ship paces by in LIGHT SPEED and the general is like what was that and Poe says just some debrea\\, I don\u2019t think that debrea travels at light speed. Well those are my thoughts just a few things wrong with the film but overall a good star wars ","true":true}
