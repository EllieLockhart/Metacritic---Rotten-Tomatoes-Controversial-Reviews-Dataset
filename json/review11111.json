Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hilarious! Funny! Witty!.... Wait\\, this isn't a spoof?\\n\\nThis movie is predictable\\, stupid\\, and has all intricate plot detail of a James Bond film. Just as 7 was a copy of 4\\, 8 was 5 made stupid. \\n\\nAnd come on\\, supreme leader Smock or whatever\\, that scene with Ray was laughable. \\\"Oh\\, I'll just make you float around for 30 minutes\\, and then get my ready to turn to the light side apprentice kill you while I close my eyes and leave a light saber pointed towards me. AHHH! I Got Back stabbed by Kylo\\, Didn't see that coming!\\\"\\n\\nThis puts shame to the star wars franchise\\, and destroys all my memories of watching the old star wars films and enjoying them. Save yourself the sadness and don't watch it.","true":true}
