The game doesn't have a high skill ceiling or anything (as it shouldnt since its a singleplayer game) but u can easily identify an experienced player from a beginner\\, furthermore the fact it has 3 playstyles (4 if you find the hidden one) that can be switched to at any time adds a lot of depth and stratagy to the combat which wasnt in the series before this game. Grabbing thing from the environment to beat the **** out of people with is really fun and so are heat actions. The combat is so well design that if done right combat encounters can look like well choregraphed fight scenes. This game also has the most memorable and most fun bosses in the series along with Kiwami\\, atleast for me. Even though I personally like kiryus playstyles more than those of Majima\\, majimas playstyles are still great but they take more getting used to than those of kiryu and therefore\\, at first feel less satisfying as a result. As expected in a yakuza game the side stuff here is well made and entertaining. I love the aesthetic and the setting. The story here is great but its a pain to skip on repeat playthroughs due to the fact there is a lot of dialogue\\, this results in a game that isn't as replayable as kiwami and kiwami 2\\, which have stories that are easier to skip\\, but its still very replayable. along with this skipping the story results in bad pacing unlike some other games in the series where it still retains good pacing if the story is skipped. There are also a couple of tedious escort missions that are just not fun and the game is lacking when it comes to beat em up stages when you consider how long it is\\, it has roughly the same amount as kiwami but kiwami is a much shorter game so u would expect 0 to have more. There are also a lot of parts where you're stuck trying to find where you need to go next\\, these parts are really unfun for me. I rate games based on enjoyment and this one gets a solid 9\/10\\, it has its flaws yes\\, but they didn't stop me from enjoying the game during 90% of the time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
