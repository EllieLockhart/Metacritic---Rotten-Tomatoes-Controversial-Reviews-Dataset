Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Star Wars: The Force Awakens left you intrigued over its mysteries and cliffhangers\\, lower your expectations now. Watching The Last Jedi\\, it's unclear whether Rian Johnson has never seen The Force Awakens\\, or was simply uninterested in the foundation it built for the new trilogy. Either way\\, nearly every plot thread and mystery established in TFA is at best ignored\\, and at worst given the most disappointing resolution possible.\\n\\nEven beyond its disregard for its immediate predecessor\\, The Last Jedi is so poorly written it's hard to believe. Plot holes\\, lore inconsistencies\\, and absurd conveniences abound. The entirety of the story hinges on a well-established character acting in complete contrast to his\/her well-established personality\\, with almost no explanation. Future Star Wars films will have to work desperately to patch the holes blown into the fabric of this world and its workings\\, as The Last Jedi irreversibly changes the series' mechanics of space travel and combat. Further\\, the movie's shoehorned morals are at best nonsensical and at worst sociopathic. If you see the movie with a crowd\\, you will likely be able to hear the sound of eyes rolling in tandem at one particularly preachy scene\\, as Star Wars' new worst character delivers Star Wars' new worst line and demonstrates the film's creators' incredible lack of self-awareness.\\n\\nThat said\\, some small amount of credit must be given for the film's striking visuals and a few standout performances. In particular\\, Mark Hamill gives perhaps the best performance yet in any Star Wars film and demonstrates his incredible professionalism in the face of a very poor script. Unfortunately\\, his talent\\, presence\\, and gravitas are dramatically underused.\\n\\nOverall\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a nihilistic\\, depressing\\, and straight-up dumb story that squanders its nearly every opportunity\\, and leaves the Star Wars canon broken likely beyond repair.","true":true}
