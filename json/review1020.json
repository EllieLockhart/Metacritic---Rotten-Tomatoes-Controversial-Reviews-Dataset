Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another great addition to the Star Wars universe. While not without some flaws\\, I found The Last Jedi to be fun\\, interesting\\, and thoughtful. The visuals and cinematography are amazing with some terrific shots\\, especially in the third act. It was awesome to see Mark Hamill back in the saddle as our favorite hero\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and to see the rest of the cast work so well with each other.","true":true}
