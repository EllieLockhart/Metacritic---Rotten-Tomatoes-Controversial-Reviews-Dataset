Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi achieves a great feat\\, it makes Star Wars human again.  It deals with the perils of becoming old\\, how life beats you down over time\\, and how easy it is to become disenfranchised with the optimism of our youth.  It shows the importance of hope and of blind faith but also shows that they do not come without consequence.  It shows leadership without heroism\\, by way of example from Luke Skywalker\\, and by way of hand holding by Leia Organa.  In our protagonist Ray we find a strong woman who is compassionate\\, who wants to understand who you are as much as figure out who she is\\, who wants to see the good in all people and stands up against anything that challenges that good.  In Rose we find a wide eyed youth that is rooted in what is right with a penchant for a brave man that has been mistreated and conflicted\\, but is her equal in what is right.  Kylo is struggling to find himself within the sum of all his parts\\, his mother\\, his grandfather\\, his father\\, his uncle\\, all legends... \\\"but who am I\\\".  With Jedi we finally see a soul inside of our Villain\\, and it makes us feel even more hate for him at times\\, while we still feel his pain.  Just a brilliant brilliant story\\, a brilliant sequel.  Beautifully shot\\, it may be one of the best sci-fi movies ever photographed.  It will make your head spin the first time you see it\\, it will gut your fandom theories to the core\\, it is not for the Star Wars fan that wants the status quo\\, or the Star Wars fan that has nothing going on below the surface of his Luke Skywalker cosplay cloak.  This is a movie for all of us that love the movies\\, that want to be transported to places we could not think of on our own.  This is the movie we have been looking for for the last 37 years.  Bravo.","true":true}
