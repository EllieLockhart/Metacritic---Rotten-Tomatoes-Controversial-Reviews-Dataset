Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Breathtaking. Amazing. Funny. Guy wrenching.\\n\\nI'm a lifelong fan of Star Wars and I have to say that Johnson has produced a masterpiece of the series.  I can't wait to watch this movie again and again\\, as it might just be my favorite of the series.  The film is beautifully set up to give you scenes that are familiar enough you feel they might be predictable\\, but turn quickly toward the unexpected.  I saw it on opening night and the theater laughed together\\, cried together\\, and sat in stunned silence together through this emotional roller coaster.  Powerful movie and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
