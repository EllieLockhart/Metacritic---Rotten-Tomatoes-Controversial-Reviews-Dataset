Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A no plot film.  You can actually got from Force Awakens straight to Rise of Skywalker and not miss any information - at all. Insulting way to handle Luke's moments\\, absolutely slapping the audience with any love for the original trilogy.  Don't ruin Star Wars for yourself and skip this non-logical\\, rule breaking waste of time.","true":true}
