Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as Enjoyable as episode 7\\, due to over inflated running time and forced humorous lines that the  director thought would enhance the movie and it fails for the most part. Beautifully shot and well acted except for weird turns by Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern. Adam Driver plays the villian with great aplomb and the film pays proper tribute to the late Carrie Fisher. I liked it but didn't Love it! 12-21-2017","true":true}
