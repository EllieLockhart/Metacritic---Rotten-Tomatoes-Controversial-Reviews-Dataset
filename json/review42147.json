Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined star wars for me there is no where to take this story in the next episode\\, the trilogy arc has been broken\\, so many good plot lines thrown away. The only way this can be recovered is if Disney suffers a financial blow then maybe they will start listening to the fan base. Reading the professional reviews makes me 100% convinced that they are not biting the hand feeding them and I will never ever trust a professional review again. I wish Rian Johnson is relegated to direct tampon commercials for the rest of his life.","true":true}
