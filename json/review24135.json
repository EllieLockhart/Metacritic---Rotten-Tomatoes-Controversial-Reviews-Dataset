Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe not the story we wanted or expected\\, but most certainly the story (I) needed\\, The Last Jedi manages the near-impossible act of both completely subverting the classic storytelling mechanics of the franchise while affirming\\, (maybe) better than any film since Return of the Jedi\\, the core themes of the series. The movie uses a deft\\, resonant\\, metatextual script to tell a story about the indomitability of hope\u2014of perseverance against both impossible expectations and the oppressive weight of almost certain failure. It's in both acknowledging and surviving failure\\, the movie insists\\, that we can transcend it\\, and it channels these concepts through the character of Luke Skywalker. Unlike Ben\/Kylo\\, who is so deadened by his failings that he has become a sort of ultimate nihilist\\, Luke learns that inaction is just crippling as defeat; in choosing to reconnect with the force\\, Luke regains his sense of purpose and hope. At its heart\\, beneath the unfamiliar tone and uncomfortable character turns (burdened\\, it should be noted\\, by the narrative choices established in The Force Awakens)\\, The Last Jedi is a call to arms\u2014less a soap opera than a story about human frailty and the almost superhuman feat of carrying on. I fully acknowledge the broader criticisms and can see\\, with plenty of sympathy\\, why people are cold on this movie\\, but The Last Jedi felt more complete to me than any Star Wars entry since Empire.
