Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The creativity of different worlds and living beings is still amazing and awesome. There's no way not to feel in love by this transcedental creativity! Disney is doing a great job continuing the Saga without losing its authenticity.","true":true}
