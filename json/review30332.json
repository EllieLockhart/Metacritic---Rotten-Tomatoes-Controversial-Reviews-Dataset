Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Second viewing today despite being highly disappointed in my first viewing. A strange thing happened: I REALLY enjoyed it this time. My rankings of Star Wars films Best To Worst: 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, Rogue One\\, 7\\, 8\\, 3\\, 1\\, 2. Go see it at least twice.","true":true}
