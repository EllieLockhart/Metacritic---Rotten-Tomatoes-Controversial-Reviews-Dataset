Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney messed up Star Wars. Very little Character development and too many questions left unanswered!  This is coming from a die hard \\nfan who has seen a new hope over 200 times... \\n\\nSpoilers... Disney broke all the rules established in previous episodes the Dread Naught was the only Star ship to not have shields?\\nNo answers about Snoke\\, how he was so strong in the force was he Sith or the Darkness something deeper than Sith?\\nRey's parents: that was just total laziness by Rian Johnson we could have done less with the side stories and spent more time with having Rey train with Luke learning about the force and why it needed to end. Really developing the character bond  similar to Luke and Obi-wan or Luke and Yoda.\\nLastly\\, what they did to Luke Skywalker was utter disrespect for not only Mark Hamill but also the core Star Wars fans who saw him grow from a young Farmboy to the strongest Jedi who ever lived Thisbe was the moment everyone had been waiting for since ROTJ to see how powerful he had become and then after astral projecting himself to confront the First Order and his Nephew he just disintegrates.\\n\\nSave your money and don't support this movie\\, then maybe they will make a movie suitable of the Star Wars brand.","true":true}
