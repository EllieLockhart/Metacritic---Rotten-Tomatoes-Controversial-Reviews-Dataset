Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Due to it's high budget The Last Jedi looks and sounds amazing. Clearly none of the budget went into its script unfortunately\\, because the plot is riddled plot holes and is an inconsistent mess along with its characters. The movies tone is all over the place. Characters are cracking jokes during serious scenes where peoples lives are at stake. The action also has enormous problems. There's one scene in which the choreography is flat out embarrassing and they literally edit out one of the enemies knives just so our protagonist doesn't die. Some praise this for being \\\"original\\\" but there were scenes that were clearly ripping off The Empire Stikes back and everything set up from the previous star wars movie The Force Awakens is practically thrown out of the window. The movie damages the star wars franchise in general by breaking basic rules established in the universe. It is baffling that the director was able to get his FIRST DRAFT appoved for a movie in one of cinemas most popular franchises. The movie was so embarrassingly bad that it has practically destroyed any hope for the future of star wars which is ironic since hope is a huge thing in the franchise...","true":true}
