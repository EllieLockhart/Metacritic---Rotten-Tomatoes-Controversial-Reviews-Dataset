Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find that if you haven't been watching the previous films in the Star Wars saga\\, you're going to have a hard time keeping up with the story. This chapter in the sequel trilogy also left me more questions that I'm hoping will be solved in IX.\\nLast Jedi for me is a passable film. I don't find it better than Empire Strikes Back. I did manage to get some enjoyment out of the film\\, and I praise its darker tone by killing off some significant Star Wars characters.","true":true}
