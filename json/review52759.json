Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost every scene has something wrong with it. I really liked force awakens\\, so it's not just the fact that it's a new movie\\, and it's definitely not because I'm afraid of female lead roles. It pretty much scrapped episode 7 right out of the get go. From plot wholes to forced agendas to poorly timed jokes to time filling meaningless shots to killing off built up characters from the last movie\\, this movie sucked.","true":true}
