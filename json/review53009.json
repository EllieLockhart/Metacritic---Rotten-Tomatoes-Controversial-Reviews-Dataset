Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, it pains me to say that this is the worst written\\, worst conceptualized and worst executed film in the franchise. The visuals are outstanding as one might expect\\, but in an age where this kind of experience is commonplace\\, it fails to stand out in that regard. \\nThe plot is filled with holes that the writer clearly never attempted to fix or never noticed due to lack of editorial assistance or carelessness. \\nThere are plenty of breakdowns of this movie on YouTube and other media which can do this movie the justice it requires. I advise checking those out before and\/or after seeing the film\\, especially since the visuals are so dazzling that they might distract you from the poverty of narrative quality.","true":true}
