Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent film\\, but it continues to focus too much on simply remaking the original trilogy. This film at least starts to introduce some new elements\\, unlike Episode 7\\, but the abundance of plot holes and extended cameos of former series stars really drags it down.","true":true}
