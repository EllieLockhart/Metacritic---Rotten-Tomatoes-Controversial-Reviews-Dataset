The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A divisive game for sure\\, but one that possibly deserves every bit emotion it generates. This is a story of vengeance and loss that affects not only the characters but the player themselves.\r\rFrom the beginning we are presented with the hardest truth a fan of the first game must realize: Joel has been tortured and killed\\, viciously and unapologetically\\, in front of Ellie. The trauma from this event scars her\\, but it also scars us. We feel the anger and hatred because Joel was important to us. The first game cemented our connection\\, ND being amazing at what they do\\, and they use that to elicit the kind of emotions they want from you. In this case legitimately feeling revenge and hate was the point. To make you ACTUALLY feel. This game was designed to be terrible and sad and feeling these things proves that the developers succeeded in their goals.\r\rGameplay and mechanics are essentially a given at this point\\, again masters of their craft\\, so the story is the only thing left to even consider. The grief and hurt from these events are channeled into the game\\, pushing you to find Abby and make her pay for what she's done. Make some sense of the callous and quick nature of the murder of a beloved father figure. We want to make the pain go away. We need to deal with the grief.\r\rBut that grief is never resolved. Revenge never truly sated. The reality of the futility of the pursuit of vengeance crystallized in a way I've never seen before. It is an experience you don't often get to have and it's told in a way that respects and reinforces the connections made in the first game.\r\rPlay this yourself. Get angry. FEEL. And take in the beautiful tragedy. One of the most thought-provoking and visceral games I have EVER played. Thank you Naughty Dog\\, you bastards.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
