Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With plenty of twists and turns\\, a cohesive story and a sheer tour-de-force of drama and action\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi blurs the lines between good and evil and instills a sense of hope for its moviegoers and hardcore fanbase. The newest entry provides more than just spark and makes for a unique yet improving installment. 4.7\/5","true":true}
