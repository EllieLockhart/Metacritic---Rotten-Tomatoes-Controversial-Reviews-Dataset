Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a let down it was.  How anticlimactic with Luke Skywalker. All the previous Lucas movies turned him into a Jedi badd@ss and he just becomes irrelevant like a fart in the wind in his last scene. They are trying to insert too much cuteness humor for a lack of humorous dialogue and to sell toys. Stupid bird things.  The plot was just a stitching together of far fetched ideas beyond the normal sci fiction genre. The movie never had that epic feel but an over budgeted cheesy movie on the sci fi channel. This is just above the Phantom Menace triliogies.  You now have two bigger jedi bad@sses than Luke. One of which never had any training  other than a one hour yoga session with Luke. They really rushed this plot and more concerned to play the social justice finger wagger than provife a proper story. Terrible.","true":true}
