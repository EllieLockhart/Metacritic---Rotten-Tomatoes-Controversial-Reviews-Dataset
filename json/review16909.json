Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Inventive\\, funny\\, dramatic\\, nostalgic\\, and a little on the long side--but that isn't stopping me from giving it 5 stars. It opens up a wide array of new possibilities for storytelling in this universe\\, and manages to keep the heart of The Force Awakens while adding battle sequences as dramatic as those in Rogue One.","true":true}
