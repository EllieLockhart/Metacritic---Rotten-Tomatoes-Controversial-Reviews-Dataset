Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was a massive let-down in my opinion.\\n\\nThe tone was dissected by dumb\\, cringy jokes. Even Yoda has been turned into a sassy\\, comic relief character. So much of the film - like the casino scene and every scene with Finn - felt like \\\"padding\\\". The Last Jedi made me realise all the questions raised in The Force Awakens were raised to turn Star Wars into the next Marvel universe: a predictable\\, toneless cash-cow.","true":true}
