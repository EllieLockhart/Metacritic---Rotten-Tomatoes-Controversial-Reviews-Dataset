Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the movie theater Thursday night speechless and my brain was absolutely fried. In high demand for more questions and even some concerns\\, I returned the following day for a second viewing only this time letting go of moments I wanted or maybe even expected to be in this movie. If you take out those factors and see the key moments through a different lens this movie is truly a great one for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
