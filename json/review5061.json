Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to write this! This was not a great movie. Lots of inconsistencies\\, things that just don't make any sense. Ryan seemed to take everything JJ setup in Ep 7 and just discarded it\\, leaving our 2 year wait for answers a frustrating waste of time. Now we have new questions that we will have to wait another 2 years to answer. It really seems like the writes\/directors didn't talk to eachother or work together to comeup with a congruent story at all. The special effects were cool\\, but there was very little I actually enjoyed about this movie.","true":true}
