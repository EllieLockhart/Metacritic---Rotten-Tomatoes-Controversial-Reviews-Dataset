Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe it looks good\\, but the Last Jedi has an extremely incompetent script\\, with Rian Johnson flexing on us with his \\\"clever\\\" subversion of expectations rather than giving us an actual good story that has the greater good of the franchise in mind.","true":true}
