Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mostly just to counter all the hate. Lifelong fan of the series\\, loved this movie. Isn't quite Empire or New Hope level\\, but it's fun as hell and does more than enough to \\\"kill the past\\\" and move the saga forward.","true":true}
