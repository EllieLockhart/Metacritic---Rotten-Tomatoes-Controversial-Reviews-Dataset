Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie. Loved the political echos from our current dystopia. Loved Carrie Fischer's performance. Enjoyed the other main characters' performances\\, especially the cute little penguin-chicken things. Loved the diverse cast with their good acting and good humor. It was a family-friendly flick. More back story might have been helpful\\, but not really necessary. I mean - with impossible things happening all the time\\, it really didn't matter that the story wasn't 100% logical.","true":true}
