{"101487":149999,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like many others i set up this account just to warn you about this Movie! \\nI honestly don't get how on earth  this could get an 93% rating...it's beyond me. First off\\, i loved Star Wars since i first watched it when i was 11 years old. The Prequels started bad but got better with every episode ( at least imho). \\nTFA was not perfect\\, but i eventually enjoyed it. Despite it beeing a knock off from Ep. 4\\, it had many new aspects and interesting character set ups. Well guess what\\, all that didn't mean shit and went out the window. In Last Jedi you have weird comedy moments that made me facepalm repeatedly because they were so awkwardly out of place. A completely uninteresting and unnecessary subplot\\, no character development at all. For some reason Luke is now a whiney\\, frightened old man who spends his days...well...not sure what he does on this island and why he even bothered to hide a map so people could find him. \\nDespite that\\, the scenes with him and Rey are the most interesting by far\\, and these scenes are the only reason i give this otherwise painfully bad Movie 1 Star.\\nAll in all this felt more like a random super hero film\\, but it most certainly has nothing to do with Star Wars except the name and some leftovers from the previous Movies.\\nThis was worse than Phantom Menace. Can't think of anything worse to say about a star wars movie. \\nThis hurts even to write\\, because i really wanted to like this one and not be one of those people who rant about a movie. But this turned out to be a disappointment on so many levels ...i could go on  but lets just say this:\\nIf you were hoping for a Star Wars Movie that told you an interesting Story about the Nature of the Force\\, why the Jedi were not the ones to achieve balance of it\\, where Rey comes from\\, how Kylo Ren was corrupted\\, where Snoke comes from and why he is so strong with the Dark side\\, thrilling Light saber duels and maybe epic space battles...well then this movie will tell you little to nothing about that and if it does\\, ruin it with bad out of place comedy or stupid writing.\\nIf you were hoping for a \\\"CGI-super-hero-Pirates of the Carribean 3 Movie\\\"in Space then you will probably enjoy this\\, give it 5 stars and tell the world that everybody who does not enjoy this is a hater and just doesn't understand the movie.","true":true}
