Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you evaluate this film as just another movie\\, then it would likely reach a 3.5 star rating. However\\, when you rate it as a StarWars film\\, I give it a 0.5. Why? Because it falls so short of honoring the classic characters as to be a disgrace. The bottom line is that the studio is trying to make these films for the new generation\\, and repeat the success of the original series\\, bringing new 'young' people into the fold. As a result\\, they give no shits about fulfilling the hopes of the older generation of fans\\, who've to build StarWars to its current success with our time and money. In the words of the Villian\\, \\\"It's time to burn all the old shit down.\\\".","true":true}
