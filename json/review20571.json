Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve never felt the need to review a movie but this was just a mess. You\u2019re probably going to go anyways because it\u2019s star wars but this is a movie I wish they didn\u2019t make. It was exponentially worse than episode 7 and a major stain much like the prequels on the entire franchise. This movie sucked. The last 20 minutes were good\\, but it\u2019s a review based on the entire film... which was awful.","true":true}
