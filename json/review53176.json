Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautifully done. The major themes of failure and letting go of the past dominate this film and do an incredible job of presenting them\\, not to mention how well these themes help our characters grow. I find that most people who disliked the film didn't understand that our heroes have flaws and have a set narrative they believe TLJ should've followed. The fact that this movie refuses to follow these things because it's \\\"what fans wanted\\\" makes it truly unique and allowed it to make risky moves in all the right ways. Please see this film\\, and keep an open mind while doing so. It's an incredible addition to the Star Wars Saga and deserves far more praise than what the fans have been giving.","true":true}
