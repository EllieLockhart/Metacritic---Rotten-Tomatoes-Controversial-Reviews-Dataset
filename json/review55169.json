Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went the first night\\, excited but a bit nervous. The nerves were right! Poor grasp of character\\, especially those like Rey and Luke. Worse understanding of the themes of Star Wars surrounding fascism and resistance. Rian Johnson said there was no space for Lando but I saw gaping plot holes that CALLED for his existence and presence. Porgs were cute but they felt like product placement in the cheapest way. Kylo is not a compelling villain\\, especially when everyone treats him like a child even though he's 30. Luke deserved better. Carrie deserved a better last film than this. THe romance felt forced and too fast. I'm tired of the trio (Poe\/Finn\/Rey) being separated. They repeated Finn's narrative arc from TFA almost beat for beat. Why was I supposed to care about Holdo? This entire thing was a mess and I'm pissed I paid to see it since it reached back and RUINED what I enjoyed about TFA. It actively ruined my enjoymetn of another film. Two films ruined for the price of one.","true":true}
