Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't coherent at all in terms of story. The characters seem to have multiple personalities as it changes without any transition. The writting is awfull. The tittle \\\"The last Jedi\\\" is useless as the movie focuses more on the rebelion constantly fleeing from the counter-attack of the First Order. Leia summed-up the entire experience when she said \\\"Hope is lost. The spark is gone!\\\" that's exactly what I feel about the Star Wars franchise after a movie like this one (and I actually appreciated \\\"The Force awakens\\\"...)","true":true}
