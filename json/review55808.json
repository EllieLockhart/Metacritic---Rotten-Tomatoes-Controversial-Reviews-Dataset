Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Political correctness is beginning to erode all forms of media and not even Star Wars is beyond the reach of ideological vandalism. As much as I disliked the prequels\\, they at least had the same Star Wars spirit as the original movies. The Last Jedi puts forward ideological themes at the expense of the story and characters\\, it blatantly disrespects what built the franchise which ultimately pushed Mark Hamill himself to fundamentally disagree with everything the writers decided for his character.\\n\\nThe new main character which we are supposed to root for is inherently good at everything; she doesn't grow\\, learn or make any mistakes. Rey is simply a projection of an ideal main character rather than a character that develops through their journey and through the story.\\n\\nIn short Star Wars has lost it's most important aspect\\, the most important aspect of any film: Its heart. Rather than making Star Wars more inclusive and enjoyable for all people the terrible writing has fans of the franchise more divided than ever.","true":true}
