Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost walked out of the theater. Horrible movie. Special effects were nice if that's what you want to spend a lot of money on. The new main characters they tried to bring to life were shallow and flat. They even made the old ones flat. It was like watching a knock off of star wars but it was the real fake thing.","true":true}
