Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They really let Rian Johnson destroy the franchise. There is no way they can salvage this story after what they did in The Last Jedi. It is a shame that Mark Hamil was so underused in this movie and all the potential for Finn was thrown out the window.","true":true}
