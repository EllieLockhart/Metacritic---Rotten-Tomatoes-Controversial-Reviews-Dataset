Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler free review. After first viewing I honestly wasn't sure how I felt\\, but rather than immediately taking to the internet to write a passionate review\\, I allowed two days to pass.  The Last Jedi kept me thinking for those two days. After the second veiwing I can give it my approval. Some story aspects may seem controversial\\, but the choices are honest while exposing that things you think are important are not. A space opera saga about the galaxy's most dysfunctional family...this latest installment does an excellent job in keeping you on the edge of your seat while constructing some of the most beautiful shots and color choices the franchise has ever seen.","true":true}
