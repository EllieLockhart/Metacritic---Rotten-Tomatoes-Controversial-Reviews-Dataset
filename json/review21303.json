Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with low expectations and was still disappointed. I can't decide if the writing or the directing is worse. This movie has no story\\, makes no sense\\, fails to push the narrative any further than the previous film\\, gives little to no answers go questions set up in Force Awakens and the ones it does answer are terrible decisions\\, they disrespect legacy characters with crappy jokes and actions that are inconsistent with their narratives\\, they kill off any hope of redemption for sequels. Disney either doesn't care doesn't get it or a combination of both. Either way they have effectively killed Star Wars. Thanks Disney.","true":true}
