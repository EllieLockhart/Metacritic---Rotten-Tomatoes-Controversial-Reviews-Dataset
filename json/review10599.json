Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great\\, zigzaggy visuals\\, communicating the sometimes complex action scenes fast and efficiently. Some cool individual scenes\\, and the set piece with Rey and Kylo doesn't disappoint. Almost everything else is a total mess. The biggest problem here is time. Not enough of it for the bible-long bullet point list that is the story beats of this film. This is a season of television crammed into two and a half hours. Few of the character beats resonate because of this\\, and I am left feeling nothing.","true":true}
