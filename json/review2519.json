Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A waste of an episode. A misguided story which wastes time and characters. Most of the action sequences are pointless and lacking in emotion. Generally decent acting. The scenes dealing with Rey\\, Skywalker and Ren are the only worthwhile pieces. Literally everything else is a waste of time.","true":true}
