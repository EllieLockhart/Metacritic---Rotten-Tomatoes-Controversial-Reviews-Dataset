While the basics are flawless\\, the narrative lacks purpose\\, the character arcs miss genuine inflection and the driving force of the whole story feels empty and does not provide justifiable motivation. Overall TLOU provides a fun experience for those not familiar with the theme and purpose presented in the original\\, however when compared as a sequel it would be safe to say that the story that kept players anticipating for 7 years is was predictable\\, uninspired and seems to cater to less complex themes (such as vengeance\\, heartbreak and abandonment). The story arc of TLOU Part 2 detracts from the importance of your actions\\, and instead forces you into uncomfortable situations for nothing more than shock value and hollow motivation; of which you spend the next 20 hours tracing a predefined ending with little to no closure over. While it is clear that NaughtyDog left room for Part 3\\, I would have to advise against it\\, fearing worse bastardization of a story meant to inspire visceral emotion\\, that instead caters to impulse and bloodlust with little to no moral ambiguity to ponder over.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
