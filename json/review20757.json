Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like it\\, and while not a bad movie\\, it is a bad Star Wars movie.  Wasted characters\\, extra time spent on worthless side plots\\, it has its moments of great space battles and such but killed Star Wars purists hopes for the future. Tempted to give it a half star but rather watch this over Pacific Rim. and Transformer movies.","true":true}
