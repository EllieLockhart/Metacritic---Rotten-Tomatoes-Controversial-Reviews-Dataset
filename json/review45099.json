Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unexpected and of course with flaws. Nothing will ever be perfect and what we imagine. But this took bold risks and was great. I\u2019ve seen it 4 times already. I love how they went in a different direction and expanded on the force. The messages were great. The script had some holes but overall it was great. ","true":true}
