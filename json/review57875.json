Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well. Where to begin. I can't begin to state my disappointment. I was so excited for this movie. I thought the Force Awakens was terrific\\, the rehashed plot aside\\, and I was looking forward to seeing my favourite saga return to uncharted territory.\\n\\nNow\\, first I'll look at the good. It does definitely hit uncharted territory. It's a very ballsy film. Also I continue to love Kylo Ren and Rey's arcs\\, even if the latter was fairly insignificant aside from one Force levitation in the final act. It was also a gorgeous looking movie.\\n\\nOh\\, but the bad. The bad was bad. I think they ruined Luke's character. Not so much with the current stuff on Ahch-To\\, but in regards to a pre-movie event shown in flashbacks during the film. He is tempted to take an action that\\, in my opinion\\, Luke Skywalker\\, hero of the rebellion and the man who redeemed Darth Vader\\, would never take. There's a lot more I disliked about Luke in this film but I will keep it spoiler-free.\\n\\nThe main two takeaway mysteries from The Force Awakens\\, namely Snoke and Rey's parents\\, are squandered. Fair warning\\, if you're expecting a good payoff\\, you will be disappointed. The film also sags in the middle\\, is choppy in places\\, and the Reistance fleet subplot is predicated on my most loathed of movie contrivances - characters withholding information that people in their situations would in no way realistically withhold.\\n\\nOverall\\, this is a messy\\, muddled\\, plodding film that shows brief moments of greatness. The fact we're given these glimpses of what could happen makes it all the more frustrating. One very disappointed Star Wars fan today.","true":true}
