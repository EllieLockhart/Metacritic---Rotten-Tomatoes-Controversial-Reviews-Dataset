Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson's film The Last Jedi is a fresh addition to the Star Wars saga. Although the film presents occasional flaws in the storyline\\, it is ultimately an intriguing and enriching story. Cinematography and visual effects were executed brilliantly. Luke's arc shows us how he deals with his failure in a very humane way. The romance between Finn and Rose was lacking chemistry to a degree\\, and ended up being rather cheesy. Acting and direction were done very well and the visual effects were practically perfect. John Williams' soundtrack added an extra sense of epicness to an already epic story. Overall\\, an entertaining film that embodies the Star Wars legacy.","true":true}
