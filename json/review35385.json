Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi - a film with so many things going on that to talk of anything would certainly spoil the movie for others. A film that fans will love discussing amongst each other\\, yet only rude people would post spoilers at this stage - without warning. This is your warning as minor spoilers are ahead.\\n\\nDamn! What's gonna happen in the next film now? They near about did EVERY FRICKIN THING in this one!!!!\\n\\nNOT a remake of The Empire Strikes Back\\, yet definitely pays homage to it in many much subtler ways than The Force Awakens did for A New Hope.\\n\\nThe Force Ghost scene was quite funny and very teachable as anything with that character is.\\n\\nA lot of subliminal and NLP messages used to suggest forgetting about Legends and go with the New Canon only - that was something I didn't care for as I want both timelines continued.\\n\\nGood homage to the Prequels a couple of times there.\\n\\nOverall\\, I'm quite impressed with this segment of the New Canon. I'm really wondering what will happen next.","true":true}
