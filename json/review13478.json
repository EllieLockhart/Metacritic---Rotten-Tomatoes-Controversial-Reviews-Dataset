Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fail to understand how this movie is a \\\"certified fresh\\\" at 93% from critics.\\n\\nThis movie has a very confused sense of direction. Probably would be the lowest rated of all previous ones in the franchise. With all the unnecessary narration\\, nothing is left to imagination. Useless story arcs. Not to mentions.too much and too loud use of usual tropes.\\n \\nThat said Adam Driver does deserve appreciation for standing out even in the limited footage he was afforded\\n\\n:D managing to find a non lethal blaster gun amidst all the chaos - really convenient and probably unnecessary","true":true}
