Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has destroyed Star Wars.  Luke Skywalker was my hero growing up and now his character development is completely assassinated in this movie.  This is not Luke.  And the way he was killed off because he was tired?  Unbelievable.  The whole sequence on the casino planet could have been removed\\, when they mentioned the casino I was waiting to see Lando\\, and was sorely disappointed.  Rose is a terribly unnecessary character\\, and of course shes all about saving the animal creatures on the casino planet.  What other SJW causes can Disney bow down to in a Star Wars movie?  I felt like I was watching a PETA ad for about 10 minutes.  She also ruined Finn's best moment\\, in which he could have sacrificed himself and therefore becoming a much more interesting character.  Also\\, plot holes galore.  Uh\\, why can't the first order just have some more ships lightspeed ahead of the rebels and take care of them?  I can't believe that Rian Johnson just spat in the face of all the fans when we find out Rey is nobody\\, and Snoke is just Snoke\\, no backstory.  This is indeed the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  Woe unto us as Rian Johnson has been tasked with creating a new trilogy\\, hopefully after this outcry Disney will change their mind on the creative direction of the future movies.","true":true}
