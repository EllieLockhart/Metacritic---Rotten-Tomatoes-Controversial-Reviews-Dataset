Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is utter crap. It has some great sets and visuals\\, but everything else that makes a good movie is not just lacking\\, its disastrous. The plot has more holes in it then a swiss cheese\\, the charachters have 0 development and aren't consistent with themselves. The established universe isn't consistent with itself and the main character is a typical Mary Sue\\, highly unlikable character. This would be a bad pew pew laser movie if it wasn't star wars. But sadly\\, being a part of this great series\\, just makes it even worse. The prequels are great in comparison.","true":true}
