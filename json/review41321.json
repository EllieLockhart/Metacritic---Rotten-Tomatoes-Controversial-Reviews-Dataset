Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a horrific piece of shit. The humor is atrocious\\, a whole lot of the dialogue was legit cringe worthy. Everybody knows Disney has gone all-in on the SJW tripe\\, but this is awful for so many other reasons than the overt hatred of all white men. The character development was awful\\,Luke was a joke.\\nIt's as if Rian Johnson wanted to make sure that nobody ever bothered to see a star wars film again.The absurd portrayal of Kylo Emo was embarassing\\,such a disgrace to the legacy of Darth Vader. I really didn't think it would be possible to make me completely disinterested in how this saga ended\\, but Disney proved me wrong. I think everyone with a brain assumed Disney would ruin this franchise when they acquired it\\, but TFA and then Rogue One were both ok and good respectively. TFA was a bit of a complete copy paste of the original but Rouge One really showed some promise that maybe Disney wasn't completely tone deaf about the galaxy far\\, far away.But this was the other shoe that everyone was waiting to hear drop. It's truly amazing that Rien was able to completely ruin all the goodwill banked after VII and RO in just one terrible movie\\, but he did. Im sure Abrams won't do any better with IX\\, as he's cut from the same cloth. A truly sad end for a once magical universe.","true":true}
