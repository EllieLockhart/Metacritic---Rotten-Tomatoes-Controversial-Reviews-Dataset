Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a casual fan and not a fanboy or girl of Star Wars then this is a great movie. I am a fanboy of Star Wars and I like it. Don't listen to the backlash this\\nMovie is getting from fanboys. You really can't please them.","true":true}
