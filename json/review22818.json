Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lol at all these people not getting their perfect Star Wars film.  Complete idiots.  This was a really good Star Wars flick that I thought ran a bit too long.  I love the fact that the director poo-poo'd all over the JJ Abrams setups from TFA.  Also\\, finally someone is acknowledging that the force is somewhere between good and evil.  Good riddance to the Jedi\\, let the Force forge its own path!","true":true}
