Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is satisfyingly nothing what I expected it to be! Completely revamps all of the familiar characters and story. Left me excited and bewildered at how the third installment to this current trilogy will play out! Disney is 100% correct to leave the fate of the new trilogy (after the 9th film) in the hands of Rian Johnson. All of the performances were excellent and on point. It had the perfect balance of suspense and humor\\, and what they do with Leia is unexpected and extremely satisfying. The whole thing gets better the more I think about it!","true":true}
