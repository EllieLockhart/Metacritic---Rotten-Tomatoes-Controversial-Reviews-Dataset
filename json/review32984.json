Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story structure took a back seat on this turkey! All the critics good reviews are like The Emperor's new clothes\\, they're reviewing a movie that isn't there. What is there is no connection to any characters and no reason to care about what happens to them. A few cameos\\, R2d2\\, Yoda\\, 3po\\,Chewie\\, but no reason for them to even be there. It's flat out bad writing. On top of that\\, this is like a Star Wars movie made by someone who hates Star Wars.","true":true}
