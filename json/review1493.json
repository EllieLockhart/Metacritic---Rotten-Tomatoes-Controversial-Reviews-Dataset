Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge star wars fan and having loved the force awakens..This movie is absolutely garbage.I haven't been disappointed like this in quite awhile when u factor in expectations...Story was dumb....This director has to be let go","true":true}
