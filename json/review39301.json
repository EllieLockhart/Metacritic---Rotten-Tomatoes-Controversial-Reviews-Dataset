Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a disaster that completely ruins the entire saga. There are numerous major lore breaking scenes such as using lights speed as a weapon (if it is so effective why has no one used it earlier) and leia\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s space floating powers.

Luke Skywalker is drastically different from the character he was before\\, and although people change\\, he changed way too much. The whole side plot on the casino planet was irrelevant to the story. There were too many bad jokes in the film as well. I have many more complaints with the film\\, but I am running out of space.","true":true}
