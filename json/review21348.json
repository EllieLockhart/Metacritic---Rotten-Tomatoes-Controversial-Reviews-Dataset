Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will have to start by saying that this was the biggest disappointment I've seen from the Star Wars franchise in a long time. \\n\\nAs a longtime fan I've made sure to watch every one of the releases to do my service of doing so\\, but this is one that I literally cannot force myself to sit through again. I first watched this film at the time of its release and found it to be moderately entertaining\\, if not a way to spend time\\, but after attempting to watch it again more recently with the upcoming release of The Rise of Skywalker\\, I've been reminded of the painful details I'd forgotten.\\n\\nTo be clear\\, I don't believe that every good Star Wars movie has to be an actual good movie\\, as long as it does a service of satisfying fans with the next instalments of the saga (as in the case of episodes 1 through 3). But not only can I say that the Last Jedi is a bad movie\\, I can also say honestly that it is a bad Star Wars movie\\, which already lowers the bar for what we should expect.\\n\\nThis movie is constantly hopping from one useless plot point to another\\, introducing meaningless \\\"Deus ex machina\\\" type characters to resolve their issues and manages to throw away literally every story and character arc that the Force Awakens had set up for this new trilogy. This movie changes rules in universe which contradict the previous movies in the universe and spends an enormous amount of time on characters that literally mean nothing to the plot. Characters like Admiral Holdo and Rose are examples of corny attempts of humourous and intriguing characters in this universe\\, and these characters make it feel like the director was literally pushing to change the very essence of how characters work in the universe.\\n\\nI very much disliked Luke's character arc throughout this movie. Instead of a Yoda-like mentor\\, we were given a lazy old man who hates himself... and then dies at the end.\\n\\nWe see absolutely no buildup in Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship and characters like Poe and Finn seem inconsequential to the entire plot. \\n\\nI personally dislike the way that they handled Leia's character in this movie. I was hoping that they would give her character a peaceful\\, meaningful disembarkment form the saga (as Carrie fisher had passed away before its release). But instead they continued to slash character arcs and bend rules with her character as they had with everyone else's.\\n\\nI would say that the most questionable part of this movie would have to be Snoke's death. The anticlimactic ending of this part of the plot was perhaps the most disappointing part of this entire film. Whoever came up with the idea to kill the main villain off when there is a whole other movie coming afterwards deserves the backlash that they've got from that decision. It's perhaps the most backwards decision that I've seen in any \\\"serious\\\" film to date.\\n\\nI've seen some people praising this movie lately on social media\\, but I have almost no words about this film that I could even begin to describe as \\\"praise\\\". I considered the Force Awakens to be a less-than-great start to this new trilogy\\, but sadly it's sequel makes it seem like a welcome addition to the saga\\, Or at least an addition that\\, along with the Rise of Skywalker\\, can overt people's eyes from this cinematic failiure.","true":true}
