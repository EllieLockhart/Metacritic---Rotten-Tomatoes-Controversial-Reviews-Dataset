Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sincerely\\, I don't understand why people expect the best movie ever out of the Star Wars franchise. The movies are good\\, but people can't be let down when they expect huge greatness. \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is a good movie\\, period\\, but it's not the best of the new trilogy. Some new and old characters could be completely excluded because they could make the movie more organised and focused\\, instead of swollen and drawn. But Rey\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, Kylo Ren\\, BB-8\\, R2-D2\\, C-3PO\\, Finn and Poe are good once again! Star Wars stays great as it is!","true":true}
