Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and it's a shame some people don't love The Last Jedi. Thankfully most people love it. This is bold and brave storytelling by a new master in Rian Johnson. If his new trilogy is anything like The Last Jedi we're in for a real treat.","true":true}
