Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Returned from just seeing SW: The Last Jedi and I'm Very HURT at how Rian portrayed and destroyed my favorite Sci-fi character of all-time!\\n\\nSPOILERS COMING-SPOILERS COMING-SPOILERS \\n\\n You turned Luke into a weak grumpy elderly hermit. You made a bad ass like Snoke with the all those powers he displayed fall that easy to Kylo??? Hell\\, he slams Hux from across the galaxy and slaps Rey with her own lightsaber but doesn't notice Kylo turn a lightsaber while he's focusing on Kylo??? You turn Leia into Superman with zero\\, zilch\\, absolutely no Jedi training ever but Luke is deathly exhausted from a hologram of himself???  I could go on but now it sounds like I'm just being mean and trying to bash this film when i had such high hopes! I'm frustrated when 40 years of lore go down the shitter with this movie and how everything is just Legends now. Disney just doesn't care about anything sacred and thinks they can't do wrong! I'm so\\, so disappointed and sad.","true":true}
