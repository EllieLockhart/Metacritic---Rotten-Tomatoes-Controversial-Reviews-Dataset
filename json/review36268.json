Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The latest installment of the Star Wars universe does everything that die hard fans did not want it to do. It was unpredictable\\, unique\\, and it simply broke the star wars mold that audiences have been fed since the beginning of the franchise. Rian Johnson took the \\\"copy and paste\\\"  force awakens story\\, and made it unique within the canon. This film is hopefully the start of a new\\, non-recyclable story line free from the confines of of the reused characters and plots of previous films. \\nIf you want to see something new and unexpected\\, this one is for you.","true":true}
