Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie. I truly enjoyed that it was so different\\, that so many of my 'theories' went right out the window... I loved that it was one of the most human and down to earth stories of the series\\, truly surprising. It was bold\\, and not simply adhering to the past or what we are 'comfortable' with. Plus\\, I have NO idea where they are going with Episode IX\\, but as they look forward with the saga\\, I look forward to where it will conclude.","true":true}
