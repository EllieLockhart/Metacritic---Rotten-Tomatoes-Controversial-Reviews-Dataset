Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"from any point of view\\, this film is a total bust ... the worst of the whole trilogy and it is not recommended at all ... I hope that Lucas returns to direct the film or another failure is expected as HAN SOLO -_-","true":true}
