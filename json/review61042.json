Ellie's positive and likable character is completely changed into a far more bland and generic character. Combat doesn't have any noticable improvement and quickly feels boring and repetitive.\r\rStory is very generic and lacks any meaning behind the creative decisions pulled.\r\rIn general I believe one of the worst things about this game - Is the feeling of having nothing to look forward to. There is simply nothing positive in this game\\, and everything is presented through the cold\\, frustrating and terrible feelings that this world hold. The magic of The Last of Us part 1\\, was that despite this exterior world being like this\\,  Joel and Ellie was not once they grew to like each other. Comparatively\\, Ellie and Dina's dynamic is nowhere near as positive\\, uplifting or for that matter\\, interesting.\r\rI think the worst part about this whole experience\\, is that during the various flashback sequences\\, the game shows us these more likable characters\/version of characters\\, that we grew to love in the first game\\, before pulling us back into this sad\\, cold and generic new story.\r\rThis might be the game with the most wasted potential\\, I have ever witnessed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
