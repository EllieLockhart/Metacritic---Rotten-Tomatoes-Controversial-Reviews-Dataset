Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film excels for a couple reasons\\, diversity and added depth in context to the \\\"galactic struggle\\\". \\n\\nDiversity\\, Starwars has always promoted diversity in casting the \\\"good guys\\\" against the homogenous\\, fascist authoritarianism. This film mirrors key elements from the first trilogy with an enemy close to absolute control while leaving behind the heroic one-shot victory. This creates a more complex reality to this trilogies story arc.\\n\\nContext\\, Episodes 4-6 may not have had very many women in the story arc but Leia being the most notable female presence was in no way weak. In this film\\, not only were women strong but the decisions they made were complex often having the greatest impact.\\n\\nOne thing I would like to mention is that general opinion at the time episode 6 released in theaters was that it was garbage. People hated it. At this point\\, episode 8 has made over 800M at the box-office. Although the reasons I feel this film excels in the Starwars franchise it has rubbed people with certain sensitivities the wrong way. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This film has added dimension to the franchise that creates a lot opportunity for the future of Starwars films.","true":true}
