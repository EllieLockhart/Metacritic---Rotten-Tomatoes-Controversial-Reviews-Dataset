So here's the thing\\, it's spectacular in terms of graphics and gameplay.But the story. Oh god the story. Seeing Joel killed so early on - sucked\\, but I coped with it\\, it was horrible\\, brutal\\, nasty and Negan-esque\\, but I coped.Taking nothing away from the other deaths (JESSE!) It was the Joel death that lingered with me... And then Naughty Dog went and did it. In a confusing\\, anger inducing moment I can't help but abso-f**king-lutely hate them for... They made me *be* the character that took our beloved Joel away.I felt nothing for Abby. Not when we find out it's her dad's death at the hands of Joel (during Ellie's rescue in tlou) that led to this path of vengeance\\, Not when she we see her go through some horrible - horrible things to get to where and who she is now. Not when Ellie takes her friends and colleagues away. And certainly not when we see Joel spat on as he lays there. Abby had been cruelly beating him for a long time before killing him in front of his surrogate daughter. She also does it shortly after he and Tommy have just saved her from a massive horde of infected.How are we supposed to just switch on a care for this character.How?!?!There was no redemption.None.There was Naughty Dogs message of: Life is harsh - you won't get what you want. There is no happy ending. Oh... And we'll retcon areas of a game you loved because it fits the current narrative.No Naughty Dog. Just No.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
