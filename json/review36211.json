Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was the worst-written movie of the Star Wars movie franchise.  It broke Canon throughout\\, was devoid of even basic logic\\, and had absolutely no continuity with the Force Awakens. The attempts at humor were horrendous and showed that Rian Johnson had no clue as to appropriate tone.  The movie had galaxy-wide plot holes and even a moment of serious thought leads to head-shaking realizations as to how terribly written this movie was.","true":true}
