{"101487":134010,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to give this one star because it is confirmed that 1\/2 stars or not interested does not count in the tally.\\nThis movie is an abomination\\, I have never before seen a tripple A movie with such poor story telling. You can almost litterally feel the Pretentiousness\\, the smugness\\, the sheer contempt just wafting off of the movie screen. Much like the same type of wafting that stink passes off of a freshly coiled mess your pet left of your front lawn. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy have pretty much destroyed this franchise\\, one that i have loved for decades.\\n\\nI will break this down in parts\\, I really want Disney to know my disgust with this film.\\n\\n1. The story\\, this is probably the worst story telling I have ever seen for a tripple A movie with a multimillion dollar budget. A 4 year old probally could have been given a box of crayons and some paper and come up with a better story line other than a two and a half hour car chase. Everything from the character interaction to plot its just stupid and boring.\\n\\n2. The new characters are shallow\\, there is no character progression. They feel like they were added just for the sake of adding them to have a trilogy. Lets explore this shall we.\\n\\nRey\\, this is probably one of the most hallow characters of them all. She litterally wakes up one day and within a matter of a few hours goes from a scavenger to one of the most powerful Jedi the galaxy. One capable of beating a grand master Jedi. She is invincible\\, knows everything and is perfect in every way. So Rian & Kathleen I have to ask you\\, if you went to a movie and know the main character has no chance of being beaten and is being portrayed as a goddess what form of entertainment does that provide for the you or the audience? No progression\\, no training\\, no hardship. Rey is a shallow Mary Sue character and frankly as a woman I resent that the both of you feel that the only way to make a strong female lead is to give her everything.\\n\\nDameron Poe\\, this is one of the more interesting characters from TFA\\, yet in this movie he is no longer the hero. He has been broken down from being heroic to being demasculated and being portrayed as a hot headed villain. This seems like a common theme in this movie but I will get to that later on.\\n\\nFin\\, Another amazing character from TFA. I was really interested in seeing where they would take his story arc but like all of the males in this film he is reduced to an irrational token black guy. This is a shame\\, he was a storm trooper\\, he worked for the first order\\, yet they reduce him to nothing. As discussed before I will i will get to that later on.\\n\\nKylo\\, This character is all over the place\\, good\\, bad\\, neutral\\, he just doesnt provied the audiance with what he was supposed to be portrayed which is a believable vilian.\\n\\nSnoke\\, I really wanted to see what they were going to do with him but nope\\, they just killed him off.\\n\\nJar Jar Rose\\, I honestly dont see the point in this character\\, They never developed any story lines for some of the other characters yet they add another one. She is one of the most anoying new characters that frankly reminded me of Jar Jar Binx.\\n\\nEvil condescending purple haired demasculator witch\\, I cant really remember her name because simply I was so mortified and angry with how she treated the other men and how she talked to them I just felt hatred for that character. The story arc even had that Evil condescending purple haired demasculator witch ruining space combat for the life of star wars by doing a kamakazi run on the main capital ship. This lack of obeying the lore and star wars rules will be discussed below. Why they wanted to kill off Admiral Ackbar for this evil looking out of place character is beyond me.\\n\\n3. Sexism & political motives. In my opinion this movie is rife with anti male sexist portrayals of males and elevated female charactorization. If you are a male in TLJ you are reduced to either an evil character\\, an hot headed traitor\\, or a comic relief. As a female it was completly cringe worthy. Seeing the look on my brother and boyfriends faces as the movie played out had me feeling uncomfortable as well as hatred for what I was seeing on the movie screen. If I wanted to pay hard earned money watching males being bashed or demasculated I would just rent a anti male movie.\\n\\nThere are alot more political propaganda in this film and they are as follows:\\nVeganism\\, yup chewbaca is now a vegan.\\nAnimal rights take the front seat condemming child slaves\\nBook burnings are now a thing\\nThey added God Speed to the naritive instead of the may the force be with you\\nAll rich people are evil\\n\\n4. The movie attempts to destroy pre established lore and they are:\\nThere is now gravity in space.\\nYou no longer need training to wield the force\\nLeia Poppins\\, you can now survive in space longer than 15 seconds and flay like Marry Poppins or super woman after being blown out in space.\\nYou are only blown into space if the script calls for it\\, Leia Poppins opens the door exposed to space and no one gets blown out\\nHyperdrive is now a weapon\\nNo one needs training to fly or fix a ship anymore\\nThere is now force skyping\\nThere is now force projections across the galaxy\\nYou can instantly wield a light saber and go toe to toe with a grand master.\\n\\n5. The destruction of the original cast\\nHan Solo was probable done correctly by JJ but the rest was handled awefully\\nLeia\\, she is dead in real life and when she was blown in space it was a perfect opportunity for her to be remembered as going out heroically yet she is now remembers as being a joke with the Marry Poppins garbage\\, She was a strong woman i liked her in the original trilogy.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker\\, this was my childhood hero. Thet reduced him to a green milk drinking crazy hermit that almost murdered a child. This was one of the most iconic characters in the starwars universe and they threw him under the bus. This is unforgivable\\, Rian & Kathleen; if you wanted to start starwars and do your own thing fine but dont mess with our child hood heros. I will never see any movie directed or produced by either of you. I am going to boycot Solo\\, I cant believe what you did to this franchise.\\n\\nDear Disney executives\\, as a customer I was totally offended with The Last Jedi. Your two employees Rian Johnson & Kathleen Kennedy are producing a product that is sub par and divisive. I go into theater paying good money to be entertained\\, not be preached to about political agendas at the expense of producing a quality product. They do not care about the The Pareto principle or 80\/20 rule of business. They are willing to throw the top 20% of your most dedicated customers under the bus in favor of trying to get another audiance. I as a costomer would like to think of myself in that 20%. I watch the movies 6 or 8 times\\, buy the blue rays\\, wait in line for hours to be the first one in. I buy the books and collectables. I was one of you most dedicated star wars fans yet I know find myself disgusted with the francise. Your employees are out of control.","true":true}
