Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie very much. It was fast paced\\, entertaining\\, not a single boring minute. Very understandable\\, even for a first time watcher. It had a satisfactory begining\\, middle and closure at the end of it.","true":true}
