Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could just reclaim my time for this movie.  It was horrible.  Star Wars is not a melodrama RIAN JOHNSON!  You have ruined this in every way shape and form.  No wonder you were fired.  A couple of things why in the world was the last scene shot?  We don't wanna see a fake Luke we wanna see a real Jedi fighting.  I cannot even start to understand this script or director.  Why in the blazing hell were no question from the first movie answered NONE?  No Jedi training at all...  Luke was a bumbling idiot.  And Leia using the force @#$@##@$@#$#@. Retire dude!","true":true}
