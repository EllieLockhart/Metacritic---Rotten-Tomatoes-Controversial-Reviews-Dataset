Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I read the online hate and went in exciting the worst.  I braved myself in the seat firmly entrenched in the thought of what was going to happen.  What did happen? Well\\, two things were really annoying. Luke and the disregard or his saber\\, Super flight Leia... outside of that\\, I loved it.  I brought my ten year old son.  He looked at it with magic and excitment. He wants a Porg. He loved Snoke's guard troopers.  He can't wait to see what they do next.  Come to think of it neither can I.  It would have been so easy to sit back and say \\\"this isn't what I imagined so it sucks\\\" instead\\, Logan and I had fun.  We enjoyed The Last Jedi like I enjoyed the original movies as a kid.","true":true}
