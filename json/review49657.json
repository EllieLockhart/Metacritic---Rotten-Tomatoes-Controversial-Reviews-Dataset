Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow was it bad. Help us George Lucas\\, you're our only hope. The glory days of Star Wars are gone. Entire 2nd act was nearly unwatchable and the Sith was an anemic placeholder for an angry teenager who killed off his father in the last film. Rey was not the powerful Jedi in training that I expected from watching the last film in the franchise. Luke Skywalker was good to see but not in the film nearly enough to save the 2nd act from meandering storylines. Way too much Disney-like big eyes for little creatures. So very disappointed. The music was great as was the CGI\\, both to be expected. But honestly even films 1\/2\/3 had better music. The end of an era for hard core Star Wars stories that had huge lush backstories and amazing characters. Lucas had a vibe with his stories that is completely absent now. I know many will disagree\\, but this is not the Star Wars I was looking for. This failed the Joseph Campbell and Jungian mythos that carried the franchise in the past.","true":true}
