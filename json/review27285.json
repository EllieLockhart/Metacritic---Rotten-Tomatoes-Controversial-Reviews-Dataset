Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only gave it one star because its beautifully shot and the soundtrack is amazing.\\n\\nI have been a star wars fan since I was 5 years old. I have been to every premiere since Revenge of the Sith in 2005. I have never genuinely disliked a star wars movie\\, until I saw The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThis movie completely destroys 40 years worth of Star Wars legacy and seems to do so to spite long-term fans of this franchise. Utterly disrespecting the legacy of Luke Skywalker\\, the Force\\, the Jedi\\, and George Lucas\\, TLJ tears down everything that has been built to this point\\, simply for shock value as the director himself claimed. Brick and Looper were good movies but this is an incredibly horrendous fail. The number of plot holes\\, cringy\\, unneeded jokes. wasted characters\\, and ruined moments are uncountable. The subplots are horrendous and I honestly thought I was seeing the wrong movie. I can't even take time to write out all the dumb things about this movie and its plotholes\\, because if I did I'd be here all day. The movie is also insanely political\\, which it should not be\\, to try and push the agenda of Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Lucasfilm.  I have honestly never been more disappointed by a movie in my entire life. 2 years worth of excitement\\, buildup and speculation wasted by this garbage film.","true":true}
