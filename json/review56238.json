Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is a mouth-watering\\, visually and aurally ground-breaking sequel that lives up to the Star Wars name. It's full of astounding and intense scenes\\, and campy quips that remind me of the originals. The settings\\, character designs and art direction is gorgeous\\, and overall is a step up from TFA. TLJ changes the Star Wars formula - it refreshes it\\, rather than sticking to the basics like TFA did.\\nDespite its quality\\, TLJ is poorly structured and paced\\, with weak moments and sequences many people\\, fans especially\\, will find just silly. There is a 30 minute story line that is integral to the story\\, but severely lacking in vibrancy and flair the rest of the movie shows. On reflection\\, some of the character decisions made seem poor and unnecessary\\, with the story glossing over many key points\\, and obsessing over minuscule and boring scenes.\\nThe Last Jedi opens a new door for the Star Wars franchise\\, and is definitely worth watching for its stellar imagery\\, fun and engaging main plot and intense and exhilarating sequences. 3.5\/5","true":true}
