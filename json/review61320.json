Naughty Dog what have you done to this series\\, gameplay and graphics wise this games feels and looks awesome\\, story wise is really insulting\\, and underwhelming for us fans.

Make the game so political to the point that it made you question if you guys were just trying to score points with a group of people\\, instead of delivering a neutral enjoyable experience for everyone. To top it all off you give us an ending that leaves you feeling so empty that makes you not want to play it ever again. WOW\\, we are not review-bombing we are voicing our opinion to how misleading the trailers were compared to what we actually received.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
