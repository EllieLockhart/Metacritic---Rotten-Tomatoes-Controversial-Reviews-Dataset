Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the type of Star Wars movie we needed more of as fans. Where the original trilogy was a hopeful tale that set the stage for good and evil in an amazing universe it lacked a depth to the force\\, the ancient religion of the Jedi. The prequels did not help this as they showed a more political force than a mysterious one at the core of the Jedi and the Republic. This new trilogy is expanding the Star Wars story while keeping the core tenants of good and evil alive in surprise ways and continuing it's circular storytelling that George Lucas established. While it is not clear how this fit within the trilogy and Star Wars as a whole it takes a bold step forward to create a beautiful film. The story does have some lacking pieces and some questionable plot points but overall wraps them into a must see for fans and a good change for the universe.","true":true}
