Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it\u2019s got some genuinely funny moments\\, this was the most boring Star Wars by far. Snoke is wiped away before we know anything about him\\, the movie drags on without anything happening we care about\\, and the way they handled Luke Skywalker is downright offensive. Not only the worst Star Wars movie by itself\\, it actually hurts the entire Star Wars story. Honestly wish I never saw it.","true":true}
