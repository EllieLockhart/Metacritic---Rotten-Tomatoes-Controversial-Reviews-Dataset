Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is a spectacle\\, that's for sure.  But the movie throws everything we like about the Star Wars saga\\, the lore in particular\\, out the window.  I get it\\, \\\"let's be fresh\\,\\\" \\\"let's be inclusive\\,\\\" \\\"let's relate it to the modern era...\\\"  but this is a series lore that was built around certain themes\\, and Rian Johnson said F that and threw it out the window.  I'll watch the final movie because I'm a Star Wars fan\\, but I feel like my childhood has been tainted.  Thanks Disney.","true":true}
