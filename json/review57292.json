Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an abomination to storytelling. Bastardization of beloved characters for the sake of pushing a political agenda\\, Rey is a garbage character i feel no connection to her she is comparable to superman in this.  The main protagonist doesn't grow through struggle or failure its simply i need this much power to win and so i have it.  Dull characterization of new characters and poor utilization of older established characters with complex backstories have caused this to be the WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER!.  Ignore critic paid for opinion Bull\\, just look at what they did to Luke Skywalker. the most tragic part of this movie is the character assassination of such a beloved character. Why can i not give this 0 stars?","true":true}
