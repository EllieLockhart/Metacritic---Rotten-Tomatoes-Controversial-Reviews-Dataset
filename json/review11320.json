Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hoping for a better Jedi arc in the next film. enjoyed this one a little and kept in mind that it is all leading up to bigger and better.","true":true}
