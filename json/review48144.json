Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the special effects and reunion of Luke and Leia sound exciting\\, the film never delivers on its promise. Sorry\\, true believers. As much as I love Star Wars\\, I can't give it a better than an average review. I think the cast and crew probably agrees. Daisy Ridley has revealed she cried when she found out J.J. Abrams was returning to the Star Wars director's chair. After the fine job he did with both the Star Wars and Star Trek reboots\\, I must admit I became emotional at the news\\, too.","true":true}
