Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I always go into the new star war movies expexting them to suck and with The Last Jedi that's almost the case. It's redeemed by the excellent cinematography but that's not enough to carry the slow plot and poor pacing. It also features some of the most hated characters in Star Wars and that includes Jar Jar and the ewoks. The ending is good\\, but the first half is just plain bad.","true":true}
