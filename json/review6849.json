Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't wat to spoil it with what I disliked but as an older \\\"kid\\\" who saw the original Star Wars in the theater 17 times and who grew up as a huge fan\\, I won't be paying to see this again.","true":true}
