Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is horrid. And the reviews of the bought & paid for \\\"Reviewers\\\" are just as bad. \\n\\n\\\"Don't let them steal your Star Wars\\\" - Quote from a dear friend \\n\\nFirst and foremost\\, my girlfriend and I are watching \\\"The Clone Wars\\\" from the beginning because she never saw it and we need to get 2015-2017 out of our lives. \\n\\nI am\\, per the delusional Mouse House sheep: \\\"Not a star wars fan if you don't like #TheLastJedi #RogueOne or #TheForceAwakens \\\". And I'm \\\"not a true fan\\\" per these soyboys and lesbian dance studies majors.\\n\\nSome trolls got in here\\, thought it was good humor poking this bear with a stick\\, and after all the bashing\\, being called racist\\, sexist\\, xenophobic\\, even Islamophobic for f**k's sake\\, I was glad to be in this group. And then getting trolled...? I snapped. \\n\\n#Disney #KathleenKennedy #RianJohnson intentionally alienated us.\\n\\nThey didn't want to convince us their change is better. They want us out of the way. To peddle this trash. \\\"Get rid of the past... Kill it if you must\\\" wasn't new age sith-y mantra. It was Disney Kennedy & co. telling us to F off.\\n\\nThey think they're progressive Jr future BuzzFeed writers can throw buzz words at us... Shame us... Insult us... In to letting them identity politics and agenda us out of the way to slap the Star Wars logo on whatever they want and cash in. \\n\\nWe made Star Wars what it is. Our children don't have money to buy tickets\\, to drive to the theaters. We don't have to feed the machine.\\n\\nThe Kennedy Regime with JJ and RJ stole every sandbox star wars memory\\, every Halloween\\, every viewing\\, every comfort memory I ever had with their TFA\\, R1\\, and TLJ. The admin here reminded me that the Kennedy Regime and Mouse House isn't Star Wars.\\n\\nWe are.\\n\\nFar as I'm concerned\\, there is no Star Wars beyond Lucas's pen swipe. Even he's dishonest as he's got stock in Disney\\, and his apologies after calling Disney \\\"white slavers\\\" to Charlie Rose showed he doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to stand up for us. \\n\\nI'm boycotting Star Wars until it becomes a galactic saga\\, a story worth telling again and not a $200\\,000\\,000 deep pocketed soapbox for Kathleen Kennedy and her pack of Hollywood cucks to rape at our expense. \\n\\nI hope you all do too\\, as they've already shown: the only thing they care about is money. Lucas included. \\n\\nI'm a grown man who's been there and done that\\, and out of sheer frustration of this pathetic\\, necrophiliac raping of Star Wars and people telling me how stupid\\, unwanted\\, sexist\\, racist\\, xenophobic\\, Islamophobic (I'm still trying to figure out how the F they got THAT)\\, I just broke. \\n\\nAnd may the Force be with us all.","true":true}
