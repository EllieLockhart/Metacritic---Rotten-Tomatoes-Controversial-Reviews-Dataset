Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars Film by far. Fanatics will complain about the film not re-creating a feeling they had 40 years ago\\, wanting the same only different\\, yet nag when they get it. \\nGreat character arcs\\, plot twists you don't see coming (finally!) and even though it has a little too much of those Porgs\\, absolutely the Star Wars Film I've been waiting for!","true":true}
