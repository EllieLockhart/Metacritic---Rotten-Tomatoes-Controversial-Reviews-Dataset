Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand the backlash. As a fan of Star Wars since I was old enough to watch movies\\, I loved the Last Jedi.  I thought it was just as clever and at the same time\\, problem riddled as any Star Wars movie.  And if I were a betting person\\, the casino stuff will pay off in whatever Star Wars series comes after this trilogy. Also for those that are deluded into thinking that Rey exists solely to be some kind of feminist take over of the entertainment industry...shut up. 6 films starred male heroes\\, there's nothing wrong with having a female hero. Her lack of training is a plot hole sure\\, but maybe that's the point. The jedi\/sith way of doing things never worked\\, Rey is a different breed of force user\\, neither jedi nor sith. And that's far more entertaining and intriguing than rehashing the same good vs. evil storyline that came before it.  Clearly Extremism on either side failed miserably...time for something in the middle. And a story where both the hero and the villain believe this? Even more intriguing. I for one\\, am 100% behind the series and cannot wait till the next one.","true":true}
