Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kinda fun and kinda boring at the same time. As always it had impressive visuals\\, solid directing\\, good acting\\, but the plot was a little weak and bloated. The humor was more contrived\\, less necessary\\, and out if character when compared with previous iterations. The story had the quest-based video game feel of Matrix Reloaded which led to a droning middle hour of the film. At least one major character was given a time-killing plot which made it seem like they simply couldn't think of anything to do with him for this movie. The climactic fight scenes at the end were definitely entertaining but were also a bit drawn out which robbed the movie of a true climax. ","true":true}
