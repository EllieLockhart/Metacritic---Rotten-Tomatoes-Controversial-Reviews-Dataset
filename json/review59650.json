Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The Last Of Us - is best console game ever!\rThe Last Of Us Part II - Story writers shouldn't be allowed to work anymore. It's not problem that Ellie is gay\\, no\\, we knew that since The Last Of Us: Left Behind. Death of Joel? Well that really sucked and after that happened i wasn't feeling good\\, i couldn't believe it but i thought that if they decided to kill him\\, that they got awesome story behind it! So his death isn't reason for bad rating\\, no.. The reason for bad rating is that i'm forced to play Abby (who i hate!) for half a game! Is Joel killed so we can play ~12 hours character that is 'Built like Ox'? We don't care about her personality\\, we don't care for story\\, we care for Joel\\, we care for Ellie\\, we care for Tommy\\, we care for character from The Last Of Us! You ruined everything by introducing new character that killed Joel\\, you ruined our pleasure by forcing us to play Abby for half a game\\, you ruined everything by letting Abby go at the end. What does that mean? That Joel died for nothing? Jessie as well? I finished game for 23h 34m (Survivor if someone's interested) and for what i played it almost 24h? For which goal? Why we went thru Seattle for 3 days? What was the point of a game? I don't get it. Why didn't Ellie stayed in Jackson after Joel's death? You could have ended game then\\, ~2 hours after start and it would still be better ending (and game) then this..\r\rMy rating was 6\/10\\, probably because i'm rating Ellie's half of the game with 10\/10\\, but i was convinced that Part II will be equally as good as Part I or even better..\r\rThe only thing you can do right now is to start creating Part III ASAP and to try to fix this mess by killing Abby as soon as possible by Tommy's hand (because it wouldn't make much sense to make Ellie do it since you lost that opportunity). And to create awesome story with Joel in it (he can appear in it as memories\\, to give us new moments of Ellie and joel that happened between Hospital and Jackson\\, or maybe he can be only in Ellie's head\\, to appear from time to time..)\r\rI think that we fans didn't deserve this..  As you can see no one likes Abby (even tho u tried really hard to make us at least understand her by forcing us to play her and to understand her.. By showing us her's 'good heart' because of her need to help Lev and his sister.. But even that didn't help. We don't want her in Part III\\, we want her dead!\r\rHopefully this comment will somehow reach next story writters..\r\rPlease try to fix this mess\\, it's not too late.. Part III is your only chance if you ask me.\r\rRegards\\,\rNikola\u2026 Expand","true":true}
