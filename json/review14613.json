{"101487":133676,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a star wars film for 40 years.  Yup\\, started with it in high school.\\n\\nIn my opinion\\, the good star wars films are Star Wars\\, The Empire Strikes Back\\, and Rogue One.   Half of Return of the Jedi is good but all the ewok stuff was pretty painful.\\n\\nI've read the Thrawn books by Zahn but never played the mmorgs or read other books but I would see discussion of them and the events seemed decent.\\n\\nI watched and enjoyed many Clone Wars episodes but haven't seen Rebels.\\n\\nSo you know where I'm coming from.\\n\\n\\nSo... bottom line: after watching the movie\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\, I've already decided I will never\\, ever watch another star wars film associated with the executive producer Ms Kennedy or the director Rian Johnson.\\nYou just can't unsee some things.   So safer just to avoid going at all.\\n\\nAll right so why is it so bad?\\n\\nFirst the minor stuff:\\n\\nThe movie is full of plot holes you could fly a Star Destroyer thru sideways.   Star Destroyers are about a mile long\\, by the way.  I won't go into details on those.  Just google \\\"last jedi plot holes\\\" or search youtube for \\\"last jedi plot holes\\\".\\nYou will be greated with many pages of results.\\n\\nThe movie is poorly edited.   There's a basic rule of editing.  If you can remove something and it has no effect on the ending of the play\/movie then it should probably be removed.\\nEven by the kindest view\\, at least 30-40 minutes of this movie could be completely removed and you wouldn't even notice they were gone.  The movie slower than it's chase scenes and I've seen chase scenes involving snails which were faster.\\nBy a harsher view\\, most of the movie can be removed.  Because the movie is literally about the pointlessness of taking any action or making any decision.\\n\\nNext... the bad guys in this movie (except kylo ren) are idiots.  Kylo is juvenile and needs to see Charlie Sheen for Anger Management but at least he's consistently portrayed as the character he is.  The problem with clueless bad guys is that it makes people fighting them (who don't merit the title \\\"hero\\\" and well the film actually attacks the very concept of \\\"heroism\\\" so it would be ludicrous to call the people fighting the stoogy bad guys \\\"heroes\\\".)  It pretty much also attacks the concept of good and evil.  Which is basically attacking a basic theme of the entire series.\\n\\nThis is is the \\\"Craptastic\\\" universe trope\\, made into a film.   As a result\\, almost all of the movie literally serves no purpose.\\n\\nThe movie not only ignores a huge pile of canon- it even ignores it's immediate prequel.  It's one long middle finger to The Force Awakens.  Everything set up and handed to it\\, is ignored\\, subverted\\, or rejected.\\nHere's the problem with ignoring canon reboots.  This movie *itself* will be rebooted.  In a world where there are canon reboots\\, there *is* no canon.  It may be more or less obvious but you enter a world of Spiderman 1\\,2\\,3 followed by Spiderman 1\\,2\\,3 followed by Spiderman 1\\,2\\, well at least they cancelled 3 that time.\\n\\nA long series of victories portrayed in the prior movies is completely ignored along with galactic republic of thousands of planets.  This film literally rejects\\, wipes out\\, obliterates everything that ever happened in any prior star wars movie or animated series and makes it pointless.\\n\\nIt is dystopian\\, deconstructionist\\, and nihilistic.\\n\\nBut enough about the minor stuff.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this film is to humiliate and kill Luke Skywalker.  Very visually.  Repeatedly.  \\n\\nIn this regard\\, Disney\\, Kennedy\\, and the Director are calling the audience sentimental fools and telling them to \\\"let the past go and let it die\\\" with a 3x6 (It's must too big to be a 2x4).   In my case\\, they suceeded.  I'll let Star Wars go as long as they are making it.  Grats!  \\n\\nI don't blame Disney too much- they are just a corporation and with the MCU\\, they've shown they can make popular\\, highly profitable movies that respect the characters and the audience (with the notable exception of Mandarin and chinese pressure had something to do with that dubious change.)\\n\\nIf it were possible to give this movie a negative rating\\, I would.  It actively destroys the enjoyment I had in other films previously.  I enjoy the entire Star Wars franchise less until this film is erased from canon.\\n\\nThat's it for the review...\\n\\nOkay so one comment on how to do it better.\\n\\nStar wars is a trilogy of trilogies.  Trilogies start with introducing\\, then have a period of rising tension with the low point of the entire work in the middle\\, and then denouement and rising to the conclusion and explicit delivery of the overall message.\\nStar wars *should* have been\\n\\nStar Wars 1-3 : Anakin's story.\\nStar Wars 4-5 : Anakin's Children's story. (Luke and Leia's story)\\nStar Wars 7-9 : Anakin's Children's Children's Story.   Kylo and Rey (Luke's daughter lost when Kylo went bad).\\n\\nYin Yang.  The spots of dark and light in each.   The prior six movies had been building this point.\\n\\nThe republic should have been increasingly successful over the course of the story and the big message would be that the force and force users are both dark and light and extremism is bad.  You can be a little dark without being all dark.\\nIn the middle\\, the republic was at it's darkest point.\\nBy the conclusion\\, the republic would be restored.","true":true}
