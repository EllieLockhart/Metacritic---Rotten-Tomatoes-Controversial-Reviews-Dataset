Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pointless casino planet\\, pointless characters(del Toro) pointless scenes.  Gravity in space? Bad humor. Many pointless sub-plots.   Rian Johnson\/Disney killed my favorite story of all time.","true":true}
