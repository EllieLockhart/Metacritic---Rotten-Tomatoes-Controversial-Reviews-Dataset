Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a good movie it was hard to watch the first time but i went to see it again and totally loved it I had an amazing time and Luke and ray where just the best threw out the movie","true":true}
