Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second weakest of the Star Wars films so far\\, after Attack of the Clones. Expensive visuals cannot hide a badly written story and poor decision making on behalf of the production team. I say team\\, as I can't imagine Johnson on his own can be held responsible for this mess\\, it must have been made by committee. One thing is certain\\, whoever actually wrote this has no sense of humour\\, the jokes are regular and each one\\, unfunny. Although I was sceptical about TFA\\, I got onboard the hype about 'setting up the series.' This chewed anything good from TFA up and spat it back out\\, leaving both films hollow.","true":true}
