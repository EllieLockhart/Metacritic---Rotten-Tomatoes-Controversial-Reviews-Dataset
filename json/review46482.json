Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was this movie written for (or perhaps\\, by) eight year old children?  In Rogue One\\, it felt like there were real consequences.  Now with Last Jedi\\, we're back to hootin and hollerin in the midst of battle like we're having the time of our lives.  Seriously\\, we're approaching little Ani vs the Trade Federation territory.  I know you have toys and merchandise to push\\, Rian Johnson\\, but take a tip from Gareth Edwards: adults watch Star Wars\\, too.","true":true}
