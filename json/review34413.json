Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best movie of the trilogy. Ryan Johnson showed us Kylo crumbling soul\\, Ray's devotion\\, beautiful Carrie Fisher. The relationship between Rey and Kylo becomes deeper\\, more complex\\, more attractive. He showed us Raylo\\, and the chance that Ray could save Kylo's soul would bring him back to the light. 9th KILLED ALL.","true":true}
