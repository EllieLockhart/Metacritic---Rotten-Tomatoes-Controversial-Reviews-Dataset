Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi dishonors the saga's rich legacy while adding some really lame social justice elements. -- and completely does not deliver all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for. They pretty much ruined the franchise and took away any desire to see another Star Wars movie. I just don't care about that stupid animal racing side story\\, the purple haired lady who made horrible decisions and broke the entire Star Wars Universe with her light speed attack or any of the other lame characters who make me want to fall asleep. This movie sucked so hard. ","true":true}
