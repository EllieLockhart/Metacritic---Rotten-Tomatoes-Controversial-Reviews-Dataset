Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wounder how George Lucas feels about this film... ? to me Rian Johnson has made the worst movie of 2017. There is no talk about where Star Wars is going because this guy has no clue. I had to see it for myself\\, like any other fan. Which is why the film has made so much money already. The box office has nothing to do with the quality of this movie\\, but everything to do with the fan base. Horrible jokes ( bad and childish\\, nothing like the older films). The Plot!... what plot\\, it went nowhere I frankly was board. More than half the movie was spent between a starship chase that was in slow-mo and Luke Skywalker teaching Ray umm.. nothing. Where was the adventure\\, the character development. Everything that Star Wars has become. I'm not bashing the actors they did a great job! But the story line brings nothing with it. Rian Johnson should not be aloud to make another film ever. Disappointed!!!!!","true":true}
