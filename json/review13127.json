Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know whether critics were paid by Disney to write fantastic reviews or something else\\, however I would like to share few thoughts from audience' perspective :\\n\\n1. The last jedi is not made for general public who are unable to unable to get either head or tail of the story\\, where movie is moving from one shot to another in zigzag path.\\n2. The last jedi is not made for fans either as all characters behavior has been changed altogether for \\\"God knows why\\\" reasons.\\n3. No story\\, twist were sloppy and characters hollow.","true":true}
