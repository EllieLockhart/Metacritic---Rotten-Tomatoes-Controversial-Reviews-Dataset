Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With TRoS in\\, we can see more clearly how TLJ really ruined the whole trilogy.\\n\\nThis movie destroys every lead from TFA\\, ruins both the old characters as the new one\\, and complicate things to an absurd level for Ep9\\, which is miraculously somewhat saved at the last moment.\\n\\nTLJ works ok as a standalone movie\\, but not as the middle act of a trilogy\\, let alone as part of the saga.","true":true}
