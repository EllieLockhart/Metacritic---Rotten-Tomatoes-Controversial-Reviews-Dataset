{"101487":182075,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily the worst thing to happen to Star Wars\\, since the infamous \\\"Star Wars Christmas Special\\\" -if you don't know what that is\\, look it up on Youtube... it's real\\, and just slightly worse than watching this movie.  \\n\\nLast Jedi ruins the heroes you used to like\\, makes the bad-guy irrelevant\\, and takes you through a tedious 2.5 hour long chase scene with characters who are so boring that you will be rooting for the bad-guys to win just to make it all stop!\\n\\nI truly believe that the writers and director of this movie hate everything that made Star Wars great. Disney should be ashamed for green-lighting this.","true":true}
