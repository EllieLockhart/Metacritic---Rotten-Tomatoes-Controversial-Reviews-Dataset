Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A real disappointment. Heartbroken over what they did to Star Wars. Lots of unnecessary scenes\\, too long\\, Leia's Mary Poppins scene was absolutely awful. and...Lots and lots of bad attempts at humor. No explanation of anything related to Snoke\\, Rey\\, and others. Why didnt Leia die? weird. just Weird. The critics have this one wrong. it has some cool ideas but never really delivers. I so wanted to like this movie. Oh well.","true":true}
