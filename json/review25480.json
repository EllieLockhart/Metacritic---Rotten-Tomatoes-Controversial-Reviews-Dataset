Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No respect to the SW universe and lore. More plot holes and bad writing than you can imagine and a hilarious bad scene involving Leia. I don't know what they were thinking. There is an army of people working on this movies\\, how the hell could all of them agree to include such a bad scene?","true":true}
