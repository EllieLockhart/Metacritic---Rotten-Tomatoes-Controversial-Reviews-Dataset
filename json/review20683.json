Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched Star Wars episodes 1-6 a hundred times each. They are my favorite movies of all time and will never stop being amazing to me. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the saddest excuse of a movie that I have ever seen. The plot line is complete garbage and lacks any of the wonder created by previous Star Wars movies. It makes no sense\\, offers nothing new or exciting\\, doesn't continue the story arcs of any of Rey\\, Finn\\, or Po\\, and completely ruins our beloved Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill knows and completely agrees). Imagine walking through Walmart and seeing two lightsabers side by side: the one on the right has lights\\, sounds\\, collapses for easy storage\\, and promises a lifetime warranty\\, satisfaction or your money back guaranteed. The one on the left looks like the other\\, but has no lights or sounds\\, bends at any pressure so you can't have saber battles with your friends\\, has the Lucasfilm logo drawn on the back in crayon\\, shows damage from other people in the store\\, and for some reason has foam darts to shoot with even though it has nothing to do with being a lightsaber. The one on the left most closely resembles this movie. The Darth Jar Jar theory made more sense for a plot line than the one provided in this movie. May the FORCE be with anyone going to see this movie; you're gonna need it.","true":true}
