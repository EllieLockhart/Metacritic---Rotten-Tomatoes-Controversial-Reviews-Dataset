Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably one of the worst film I have watched. Preposterously awful story paired with poor structures make watching this film simply painful. It keeps showing scenes after scenes as if they mean something\\, as if it is a meaningful foreshadowing of some sorts\\, nevertheless in fact they are all meaningless. With a bit of exaggeration\\, one could remove 90% of the film and could still get the same experience from it. It is simply disgusting how the majority of scenes are actually insignificant and irrelevant to the main story line and the ending.","true":true}
