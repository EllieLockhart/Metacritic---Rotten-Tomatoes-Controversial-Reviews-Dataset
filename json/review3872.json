Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Blinded by hubris\\, Rian Johnson butchers the entire series\\, with utter disdain for Star Wars canon and the characters who made these movies so endearing to fans.  He also uproots the entire foundation for the new trilogy\\, as established by TFA\\, either by ignoring its most intriguing elements and characters completely or by stripping away all of their meaning\\, all with a cleverness that only he appreciates.  In its stead\\, he gives us a hipster version of Avengers\\, with awkward humor and a meandering plot filled with holes and pointless story arcs.  This was a hack job\\, lashing out at the Lucas mythology like a Darth Emo temper tantrum.  The movie only succeeds in giving us a new found appreciation for all of the other Star Wars movies\\, even the prequels.","true":true}
