Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More destruction of Star wars which is part of Kathleen Kennedy and Disney's AGENDA! They recently admitted they don't care about the stories OR the fans AT ALL... Especially the original fans obviously even more so because it's the young kids that are the target for their endless SJW and feminist propaganda!!","true":true}
