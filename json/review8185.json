Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie. Rian Johnson did such great justice to the characters. Luke's arc in particular was faithful to the character we all fell in love with in Episode IV. The interpersonal conflict set against the backdrop of this galactic drama was in the spirit of The Revenge of the Sith and The Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
