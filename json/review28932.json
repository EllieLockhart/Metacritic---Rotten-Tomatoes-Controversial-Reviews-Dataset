Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"really disappointed with this movie. I'm someone who had watch all the Star Wars from ep 1-6\\, Force Awakens\\, and Rogue One several times + some of the cartoon SW and really disappointed with the story\\, pacing\\, and writing of this story. Definitely not something George Lucas would direct... Killing off Snoke so easily without him getting any backstory.. Making Luke a Jackass throughout the movie (except the ending).. and Rey being too strong after with just few days of training (excluding lightsaber training!).. oh and Leia flying like Superman LOL. WTH did I just watch... THIS IS NOT STAR WARS AT ALL!!","true":true}
