Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solid movie making let dreadfully down by some of the most nuts and bolts storytelling and rehashing of previous Star Wars films. Basically it's Empire Strikes Back\\, again!!! The hope of an original new Star Wars films has faded. Actually makes the prequels look better in hindsight.","true":true}
