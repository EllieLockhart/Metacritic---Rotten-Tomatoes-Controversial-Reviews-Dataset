Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"good visuals\\, bad story\\, a lot of miss opportunities. Jokes on scenes that should be serious and a really bad secondary plot that drags the movie to an halt. As a movie by its own stands as a pretty movie but as a sequel it fails horrible.","true":true}
