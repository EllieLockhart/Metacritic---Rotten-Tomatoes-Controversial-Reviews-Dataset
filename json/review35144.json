Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE FORCE AWAKENS was a shit movie .... and THE LAST JEDI do something almost impossible: it is even worse !!\\nDisney's greed went too far ... They DID NOT CARE AT ALL about the plot and characters.\\nLike The Force Awakens\\, we have bad actors\\, very bad plot\\, bad director and the writers did a very bad job too. \\nDISNEY threw in the garbage can the six first movies\\, made them pointless.\\n\\nI still ask myself\\, why George F....... Lucas sold SW to Disney?","true":true}
