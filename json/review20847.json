Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I warched waiting to be bad because of the script and story. But even the cut\\, changing constantly from an interesting to a boring one during most of the movie duration make it much superficial.\\nAlas\\, all characters are flat and superficial\\, I ended the movie cheering for Kylo Ren to kill them all.","true":true}
