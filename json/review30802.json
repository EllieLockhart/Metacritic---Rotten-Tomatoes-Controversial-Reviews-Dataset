Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Smoke is Smoke people...stop complaining. When we saw Return Of The Jedi\\, the emperor was just the emperor\\, he was in command and we knew less about him..The movie does an spectacular job and explaining the different dimensions and complexity of the dark side and good side of the force. Great script and terrifically acted by the cast. The Force Awakens was simply an experiment. The Last Jedi is majestic.","true":true}
