Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couple of spoilers in here. These non critic reviewers must think Mark Hammill was going to keep making movies into his 80s. The guy is old. He\u2019s not the future of the franchise. I have no interest in seeing a 70 something year old Luke in light saber battles. And for the record. he went out with a lot more dignity and honor than I expected after reading reviews. Overall I enjoyed the movie. Yes the Leah space scene was unrealistic\\, but so were many other former Star Wars scenes\\, like ummm...Anakin not dying immediately after losing half his body. Yes I know Sidious saved him but cmon\\, impossible. I\u2019m interested in seeing where this goes next. Just because they didn\u2019t answer where Snoke came from doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t. Just because Kylo said Rey\u2019s parents were junkers doesn\u2019t mean they are. There\u2019s definitely opportunity for some back stories. Kylo is still a bit torn between the dark side and the light\\, but so was Anakin even after he became Vader as evidence by saving Luke from Sidous. The next one can\u2019t come soon enough.
