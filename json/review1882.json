Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from beautiful visual effects\\, this film has nothing else to offer. It has butchered its source material\\, disrespected the once well-established characters and ruined its potential with extreme inconsistency throughout the film. Many plot points don't make sense\\, characters have no arc and development. This film is littered with plot armor\\, plotholes\\, and forced jokes that divided audience and broke the fan's heart.","true":true}
