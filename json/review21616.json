Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson ruined the new series with this film; the new trilogy was looking so promising\\, too. The damage is completely irreparable. This film looked to the prequels for inspiration\\, \\\"hey look at these CGI monsters\\\" which...JJ....made a huge deal about NOT doing in TFA because of how bad of an audience reception it got. This film REALLY wants you to care about these CGI creatures. Including a horse\/goat ride in the moonlight for like fifteen minutes. I don't what this was\\, but I want to erase it and watch the real film. Critics are really praising it\\, but I think they went to a different movie or something.","true":true}
