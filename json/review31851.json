Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[Spoiler Alert] I had high hopes for this installment considering how great The Force Awakens and Rogue One was. I was left disappointed by the many deus ex moments e.g. Leia can suddenly use the force and Luke can create a projection of himself in another planet just to name something few\\, which for me is insulting to the audience.","true":true}
