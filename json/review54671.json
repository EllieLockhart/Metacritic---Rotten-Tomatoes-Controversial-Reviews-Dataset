Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally made an account today in order to voice my disdain for this movie.  I grew up on Star Wars and even like the prequel movies.  However\\, the obvious cash-grab and shameless toy promotion ruins the flow and seriousness of the series (don't even get me started on the awkward and out of place humor).  This is all before mentioning the horrendous and lazy plot.  Come on! The rebels are running out of gas?! That rebellion would've been crushed by any opposition force with at least 2.5 IQ points.  There are several other holes that I am genuinely too angry and disappointing to talk about.\\n\\nHowever\\, what I will say is that the acting is stellar and while the brilliant acting by Mark Hamill and company attempts to save this movie\\, the film falls flat on an egregious level.  \\n\\nI still wonder if I should give this film a zero or half star\\, but I digress. The purchase of this franchise by Disney was its inevitable death\\, which we hoped and wished would not come.  I can safely say that now Disney has made Star Wars exactly what we feared: A caricature of itself to please small children.","true":true}
