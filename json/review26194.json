Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure if the critics saw the same movie or they're scared Disney will pull their press pass\\, but there is no way this is fresh SW or not\\, the dialogue alone should keep the score from getting above 70.","true":true}
