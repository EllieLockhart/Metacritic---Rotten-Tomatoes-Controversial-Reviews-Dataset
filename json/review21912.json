Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just sad....Rian Johnson\u2019s effort to be different is at the expense of the characters and the story. Rey\u2019s parentage and Snoke\u2019s origin are thrown away. New characters and side stories are useless\\, lots of people die for no reason and Luke is wasted and his legacy is pissed on. The visuals and battles look great\\, which makes it hurt more because this movie could have been SO MUCH BETTER. This movie makes the same mistakes with its characters and story that DC has made with its recent attempt at an Expanded Universe","true":true}
