Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, this was beyond disappointing to the levels I felt when I watched the phantom menace.\\nThe whole thing seemed like a poorly constructed story with forced humour which seemed to miss the spot for me. The direction looked like he really wanted to direct an 80's kung fu movie\\, which in part it seemed to parody. The cast were strong as usual\\, particularly Adam Driver.\\nThe most mysterious characters from TFA became easily discarded and discredited and were portrayed in a pantomime style. Much of the dialogue was clunky and the whole plot essentially a monkey-island style side quest during a \\\"slow dipping mechanism\\\" which made little sense.\\nOccasionally something in the movie shined such as some of Luke's speeches and revelations about the force.\\nMuch like the phantom menace there was a good movie in there somewhere but I couldn't find it as I was too busy cringing at every piece of poor humour or slapstick gag.\\nVisually impressive for the most part but when the grand enemy ensconced on their throne makes you think of a Robert Palmer video from the 80's...it's not going well.\\nAfter the decent fun of TFA and the great story telling of Rogue one\\, this was just such a disappointment.","true":true}
