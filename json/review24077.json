Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive disappointment\\, really looked forward to this but it was rubbish\\n\\nWent with my boys 15 and 18 if it was not for them I would of walked out\\, talked about it afterwards\\, they also thought it was pants\\n\\nStar Bores!!!","true":true}
