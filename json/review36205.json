Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was solid. I think everyone will agree that The Last Jedi is flawed\\, but they will also agree that there were moments of excellence. The throne room scene with Kylo Ren and Rey comes to mind\\, which was a perfectly executed scene which was immensely satisfying to see. While I don't agree with nor particularly like some of the plotting choices made in The Last Jedi\\, I can respect the film as it executes these choices incredibly well (for the most part)","true":true}
