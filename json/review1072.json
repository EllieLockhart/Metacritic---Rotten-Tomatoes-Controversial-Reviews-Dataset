Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An SJW abomination full of plot holes\\, propaganda and spiting on Luke Skywalker's character. Luke is a joke in this movie. Snoke is a joke. Phasma is a joke. The new characters are boring or just plain bad. In particular Rose and Holdo. The worst Star Wars movie by far and a terrible movie in general. I got burned so bad that i won't see the next movie in the theaters. I feel robbed after paying to watch this.","true":true}
