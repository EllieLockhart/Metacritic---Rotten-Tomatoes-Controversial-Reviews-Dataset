Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a bad joke - misplaced comedy\\, terrible dialogue\\, poor character development and disconnect with TFA. Story of Luke was a total farce - I don't think the writers have ever seen a star wars movie before they wrote the script. Very disappointed - should have stayed at home and just watched the OT.","true":true}
