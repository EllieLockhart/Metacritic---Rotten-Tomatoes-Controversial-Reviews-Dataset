Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way too much crying. Non sense cameos. What ever happened to star wars stories being built around an evil tyrant.  Could have done so much with Snoke. Luke somehow became a bumbling whiney idiot. WTF star wars universe? YOU BETTER BE MAKING THE DARTH VADER CHRONICLES to make up for this BS","true":true}
