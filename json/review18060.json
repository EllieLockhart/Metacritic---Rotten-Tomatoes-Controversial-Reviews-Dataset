Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this was a great movie. I am disappointed in others opinions that Kylo Ren is too weak. They are the ones who don\u2019t get bullying either. They are the same people who think people are too weak. Because the reality is most bullies and or villains have a \u201cweak\u201d side and they bully or are evil because they are too weak to do the right thing or to get some kind of power trip because they lack strength in other ways so by being evil or bullying others they feel big and strong. I thought this part of the acting and movie is awesome. ","true":true}
