Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have a lot of personal feelings and problems with this film that prevent me from giving it higher rating. Many of those include the story\\, the way characters are handled and written and how the mythology of Star Wars seems to have been thrown out the window by Rian Johnson. That being said the movie itself is technically fine\\, well-acted\\, great action\\, at times it has some stunning visuals and the score as always is fantastic. A popcorn flick for all ages.","true":true}
