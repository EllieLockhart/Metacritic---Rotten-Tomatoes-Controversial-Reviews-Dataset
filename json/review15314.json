Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally signed up for an account just so that I can tell you all to stay away from this terrible mess that they dared to label Star Wars. This movie is border line with Phantom Menace on its plot\\, characters\\, and overall feel. The humor was way too over the top for what should have been a darker film. It's almost as if the Director and writers never saw a Star Wars movie in their life. I'm afraid the force is not with this film.","true":true}
