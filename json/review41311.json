Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a fun time\\, but for me someone who grew up with Star Wars and absolutely loved the original cast\\, this movie was super disappointing. There were a few good moments\\, but underdeveloped characters\/storylines\\, bad jokes\\, a terrible cg chase scene\\, and the mishandling of the character Luke Skywalker ruined this movie for me.","true":true}
