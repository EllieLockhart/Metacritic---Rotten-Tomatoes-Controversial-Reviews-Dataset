{"101487":174389,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half of TFA was fantastic! They introduce and develop new characters. Then they went to blow up Starkiller base\\, and the fans were like\\, 'Yeah\\, we have seen this before.' But it was still a good movie because it left a lot of questions to be answered\\, and a starting point for the next movie. The Last Jedi was none of that. ZERO character development\\, ZERO lightsaber battles\\, ZERO questions answered. (I choose not to believe that Rey's parents were nobodies). Snoke was a flop\\, Phasma was a flop 2.0\\, and Luke didn't even train or help Rey. Luke was ruined for me\\, in my opinion. They just didn't follow up on the plotlines from TFA. Instead they followed pointless subplots (Casino Night).","true":true}
