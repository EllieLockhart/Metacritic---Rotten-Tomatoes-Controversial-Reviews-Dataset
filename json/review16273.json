Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to go into great detail on this movie\\, suffice it to say\\, it was bad. \\nThe problem with modern Star Wars is cultural infiltration. in 1977\\, George Lucas introduced us to a universe we had never seen before\\, never even imagined\\, and we loved it. For a moment\\, we forgot our politics\\, our biases\\, our gender issues...we just let ourselves escape to that place \\\"in a galaxy far far away\\\". Essentially\\, what we were presented with was a window\\, a window into a fantasyland.\\nFast forward to the 21st century and all you have today is a mirror. So instead of showing us something different and unbelievable\\, we get political commentary\\, racial balancing\\, ethics lessons\\, animal rights issues...with some rather mediocre special effects If I may say.  Disney is trying too hard to please everyone\\, and when you do that\\, you end up disappointing everyone. \\nAnd where the hell is Steven Spielberg? of all the directors who could make a great Star Wars movie\\, isn't HE #1? so why the heck is JJ Abrams directing ANOTHER one? \\n\\nStar Wars is dead. Long live Star Wars.","true":true}
