Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"worst dismay starwarsfilm ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh\\ni have seen it twise on big screen and sky it is worst secont time so poor bad script.\\nThe last jedi has a narrow minded view of space and give people with no influence or power too much screen time.  The music and some effects were ok but were hacked and cut together in suck a way it seem to look outdated. The film went down hill fast the casting was poor and did'nt work bad C.G.I made it worse.  The only actor who was ok was po the rest were trashing their prevous rolls in franchise even bb8 is now as usesless  as the snowman in frozen. Its like a bad wizard of oz remake with marypoppins \\nThe villian is just a projection so can't be killed fin is lion\\, po tin man\\,bb8 toto\\,rey dorothy  and she can't get home.","true":true}
