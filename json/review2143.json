Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As visually stunning as this movie is\\, it can not make up for its flaws in virtually all other departments. It disrespects established rules of the Star Wars universe\\, has pacing and tonal issues and is generally just absurd when it comes to the plot itself. There wasn't even a memorable lightsaber battle or just a memorable score in the soundtrack to make the movie worthwhile.","true":true}
