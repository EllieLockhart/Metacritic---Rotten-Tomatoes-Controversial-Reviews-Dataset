Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst Star Wars movie that has ever graced the screen\\, but it honestly was a disappointment\\, after all the build-up\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" did not leave a great taste in my mouth.  It is original\\, but for all the wrong reasons\\, in fact the creative choices they made in this movie\\, made me feel like this addition to the saga was a regression for the Star Wars universe as a whole\\, and makes me yearn for a movie that was more faithful to the flawed\\, yet more gripping stories that the expanded universe had to offer.","true":true}
