Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"created account just to review this hunk of crap.  Giving it 1 1\/2 stars just because I heard they don't get counted otherwise.  Should be 0 stars.  Movie is an abomination that contradicts given history from prior movies\\, completely dismantles all setups from The Force Awakens (which BTW also sucked)\\, and even contradicts itself in several places.  It has some of the worst writing in any movie in modern memory.  It was made by someone who clearly cares nothing about the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
