Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes a mockery of everything that is Star Wars. Rian Johnson try's to play it off like he's trying subvert our expectations\\, but what he actually did\\, was prove that he knows nothing about what makes a Star Wars movie. JJ did a great job at laying a foundation that made us want to come back\\, and see all of our questions answered. That doesn't happen. He kills Luke off in the most disrespectful way imaginable. All of the questions that we had were played as meaningless\\, but these questions are why the film did so well in the first place. People wanted answers to all the questions raised in JJ's film. Even HISHE did a better job at telling this story. It also put JJ in the awkward position of trying to pick up the pieces for the final installment in the trilogy. Which was also terrible. You can't even call it a trilogy\\, because the two directors didn't even try and work with one another to try and make the best possible product. Now\\, we're left with three movies that all feel very different.","true":true}
