Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"its like they took every clifhanger from TFA and said \\\"naw its not important\\\" Snokes identity is irrelevant\\, Reys parents are irrelevant... everything is irrelevant and if Poe had been in an actual military his actions would have had him tried for treason. \\nFinn and his side story line was unnecessary and the interactions between him and Rose felt forced.","true":true}
