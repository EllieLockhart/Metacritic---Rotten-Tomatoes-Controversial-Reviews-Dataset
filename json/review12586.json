Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't express how disappointed I am with this film. I felt Disney would F@!$ up Star Wars & it took three movies for them to finally do it. The plot holes are galactic in scale & Rian Johnson showed no respect for the ethos of Star Wars. The fact he still can't own the fact he fracked up shows how pretentious he is. Last Jedi is horrible & no I'm not some angry white anti-social justice nut. The movie just sucks. It's not a Star Wars film. It has the charecters but it's written in a style that is not complimentary to what the Star Wars universe is.\\nI now watch this movie for the same reason people watch \\\"The Room\\\"  just to marvel at how horrible it is. How did the guy who made \\\"Looper\\\" F'up a Star Wars film this bad? Maybe because he's an arrogant artsy farsty dyck that felt it was more important to experiment with an iconic sci-fi franchise the way you'd tinker with an indie film from Sundance.
