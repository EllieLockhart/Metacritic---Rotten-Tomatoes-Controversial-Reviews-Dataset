Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love what Rian Johnson did with the characters.\\n\\nThe emotional connection is strong with this film.\\n\\nThe first hour-and-a-half is oddly paced (the film is long overall)\\, but the last hour?\\n\\nAlmost perfect. Contains some of my favorite movie moments in movie history.\\n\\nThere's a change I won't watch this trilogy again; I will still watch TLJ on its own. I love it that much.","true":true}
