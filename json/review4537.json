Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematically I thought it was good\\, almost great. Unfortunately it's ESB in reverse with a bit of throne room ROTJ for good measure. \\n\\nAlso Disney has continued its efforts to destroy everything that made the core Star Wars what it was\\, the Skywalkers. Killing Luke ruined the movie for me. I didn't think I could be more let down after killing Han off.\\n\\nThe last three movies shouldn't have been to introduce a new generation. Side stories could have done that. These should have been Luke ending the order and returning the republic to the galaxy.","true":true}
