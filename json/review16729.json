Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In many other user reviews you can read how far these characters stray from what was set in the original trilogy.  Beyond that\\, there are other more objective problems with the film.  The many attempts at humor feel very out of place and just fall flat most of the time.  Our lead characters introduced in The Force Awakens have almost no interactions with each other\\, something that made audiences connect so well with the originals.  I left this movie caring less about Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe than I did after TFA.  Not that I wanted this film to rehash Empire Strikes Back\\, but when that movie concludes it leaves audiences very psyched to see the next installment.  I now have very little interest in the fate of the newer characters following The Last Jedi\\, and since there won't be any real appearance of the original characters in episode IX\\, I'm pretty much done with this series.  The only real positives I can give TLJ is that it is a very competently shot\\,  pretty film to look at.","true":true}
