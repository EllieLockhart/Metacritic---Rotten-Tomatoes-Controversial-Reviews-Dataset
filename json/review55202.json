Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JAR JAR BINKS ALL IS FORGIVEN PLEASE COME BACK?\\n\\nHave i caught your attention?\\n\\nThis movie was so God awful that i would ask Jar Jar Binks to come back and direct the next one as the current people dont seem to know what they are doing.\\n\\nLet me say that i NEVER do reviews but this completely hateful movie disappointed me so much that it has made me want to do this review.\\n\\nI am not going to go into a long list of why its bad as there is enough people who have covered why this is so bad in other reviews\\, please read them.\\n\\nAll the bad negative reviews are not haters are going to hate or fan boys but genuine fans\\, people that love the Star Wars Universe HATE this movie so much\\, this movie is not BOLD\\, unless bold is another name for completely gutting the Lore from Force Awakened\\, its as if someone hated Force Awakened and just decided to kill everyone on both sides in this movie Empire\/Rebel - there is no real strong personality\/hero\/villain on either side that will be a driving force for both sides.\\n\\nEven if this movie had been dark or bleak it would or could leave me optimistic or hyped for the next one - this movie shook my confidence in this franchise and i have no optimism or faith that Disney can deliver a good movie in the main trilogy\\, that is how badly they have done with this movie.\\n\\nWhen i was sitting in a cinema watching Force Awakened i had a tear of joy\\, this felt like a Star Wars movie\\, i was so happy\\, i had faith in Disney and was looking forward to seeing where they would take us but this? - i was sitting watching this mess and the only tear i had was one of sadness - lyrics from American Pie running through my head 'The Day Star Wars Died' - sorry any love i have or had for Star Wars has been nearly snuffed out\\, to get me back and others back who completely hate this movie they need to pull a miracle off on a large scale.\\n\\nI had someone say i was only part of the 1% that hated this movie\\, well guess what? that percentage has fairly grown - Disney has split the fan base\\, split the community\\, well done Disney!  \\n\\nAnd one last parting comment hey f*ckwits\\, all r*tards that cant understand why myself and others really REALLY hate this movie\\, have a really good hard think about it\\, what was actually so wrong with this story that you turned a good number of hard core Star Wars fans against you\\, instead of me wanting to go see this movie a 2nd and 3rd time and rant on to people how freaking awesome it is im writing a fecking review on here saying how bad it is!!!!!!","true":true}
