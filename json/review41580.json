Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is full of plot holes and  incompetent characters that ruin its immersion. It's weak narrative which lacked any strong motifs was also quite disappointing. I'm giving it 1.5 stars for it's weak but semi-interesting themes\\, and its mediocre plot. Watching this movie makes me feel sick. I would much rather watch Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
