Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie transitions the Star Wars universe beyond the Skywalker Saga and opens up the possibility for future of the series. Looking forward to the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga in the next movie and the evolution of the Star Wars Universe. ","true":true}
