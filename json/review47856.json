Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to start.... there were just several things that killed the movie for me. Emperor Snoke's lack of character development. No background info on him\\, and then he died a very unbelievable way in my opinion. Kylo was mentally unable to breach Rei\\, but all of a sudden can manipulate Snoke? Especially when it appeared that was Sokes power? Also\\, it seems he turns to the light just to change again and want to kill everyone? Then decides to just kill the Rebels. Not to mention Luke Skywalker abandoning everyone for years. It was very different from his original character. Also several parts felt very unbelievable. Overall i was just not impressed.","true":true}
