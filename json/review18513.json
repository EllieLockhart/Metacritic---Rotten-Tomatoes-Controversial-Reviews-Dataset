Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is so popular now to hate Disney's Star Wars\\, but\\, please\\, don't listen to them or you'll miss the the good movie. The Last Jedi is awesome! I really enjoyed this movie. Adam and Deisi are great! The story is interesting and respects the old Star Wars trilogy. I think\\, everyone who loves Star Wars should watch this movie! =)","true":true}
