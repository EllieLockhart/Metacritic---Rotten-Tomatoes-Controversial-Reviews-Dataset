Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I hadn't paid so much money to see this disgrace of a \\\"Star Wars\\\" film - if you can even call it that - I would have got up and left like several others in the audience after Carrie Fisher flew through outer space like Peter Pan. This movie tried too hard to be funny as well with corny lines and pointless interactions. Not to mention\\, the main villain Snoke was less developed as a character than a minor side character. If you go to see this movie\\, enjoy your pandering\\, Disney-fied husk of the universe that George Lucas worked so hard to develop. Episode I was actually better. Your jaw will drop for sure\\, but in disgust rather than awe.","true":true}
