Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u201cStar Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\u201d has the ingredients for an amazing Star Wars film\\, but some of them feel raw\\, out of place and don\u2019t sit well. However\\, the parts that work are some of the greatest in the franchise and make the trip to the theater worth it.","true":true}
