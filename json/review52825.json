Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people are unhappy with some of the questionable plot points of the movie. I wish there would have been more background information provided\\, but overall the film was still amazing. In the trailer Luke says \\\"this is not going to go the way that you expect\\\"\\, and he was right. Lots of twists and turns\\, and an awesome closing sequence. 10\/10 would recommend.","true":true}
