Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was the perfect sequel to a beautiful and yet brutal original. This game made me feel every emotion with such conviction and power. I laughed. I felt felt genuine fear and dread. And felt longing. I felt pain\\, frustration\\, insecurity\\, hopelessness\\, desperation\\, sadness\\, the list continues. But when this game was most powerful was when it made me cry. Yes\\, you read that correctly.This game was the perfect sequel to a beautiful and yet brutal original. This game made me feel every emotion with such conviction and power. I laughed. I felt felt genuine fear and dread. And felt longing. I felt pain\\, frustration\\, insecurity\\, hopelessness\\, desperation\\, sadness\\, the list continues. But when this game was most powerful was when it made me cry. Yes\\, you read that correctly. And yes\\, I like watching John Wick partly due to the high body count in each show. In this game however\\, each death carries weight and slowly chips away at your humanity and sanity. I\u2019ve never felt so emotionally drained and exhausted after an hour long session\\, not really wanting to pick the controller back up. But I did. I kept pressing forward because the story and emotions felt from the characters are so deep and feel so incredibly real. I could not stop playing. Many have argued about the gritty content and perhaps even an ending they weren\u2019t expecting or wanting but look at the world in which this game takes place. It\u2019s not a pleasant\\, happy or fair world. It\u2019s a world ravaged by a horrific virus that has stripped humanity down to its most raw and dangerous form. Anyone who expects the game to sunshine and butterflies with everything nicely gift wrapped is playing the wrong game. It\u2019s a horrible world filled with even more horrible people. More so horrible\\, and in many cases\\, scarier than the actual infected population. With all of that being said this was the single greatest game I have ever played in my life. Every tear that fell from my eye was so powerful and carried meaning. This game is better than 99% of Hollywood movies that have ever existed. This game will make you think\\, laugh\\, cower in fear\\, grit your teeth in anger\\, and leave you ugly crying in the shower if you think about it too hard the next day. But it is worth every emotion and then some. Game of the year? Nah\\, game of the century.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
