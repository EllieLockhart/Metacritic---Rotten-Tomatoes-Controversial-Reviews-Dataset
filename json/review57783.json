Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"visually stunning which makes you think it's amazing\\, but will leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few hours and very sad after a week.\\nIt's the kind of sadness that could lead a princess to just die because shes sad.","true":true}
