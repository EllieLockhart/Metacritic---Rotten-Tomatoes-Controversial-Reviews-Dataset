Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This isn't going to go the way you expect.\\\" Truer words have never been spoken. The darker aspects of the story - the conflict between Luke\\, Rey\\, and Ren - actually works quite well in this film\\, IMO. The film manages some surprises\\, mostly playing off reprises of scenes from Episodes V and VI that do not go the way you might predict. Sadly\\, the remainder of the movie is a mess. Finn comes off as a complete idiot\\, as does Poe. Fortunately for them\\, the First Order is also made up of idiots. Then there is *that* scene with Leia. What should have been a great Star Wars movies is instead one of the weakest. Which isn't to say that it is terrible\\, but it isn't remotely close to the best of this franchise. It wants to be this trilogy's Empire Strikes Back and fails.","true":true}
