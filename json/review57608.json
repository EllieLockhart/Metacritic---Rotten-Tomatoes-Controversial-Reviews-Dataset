Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest\\, it's only really getting a 3 because it's Star Wars.\\n\\nThere are a few moments in this film that blow my socks off\\, like when the sound completely disappears during \\\"THAT\\\" lightspeed sequence\\, and when that one guy gets a lightsaber through the head. Really made me shout out loud during the film.\\n\\nHowever\\, the more I think back\\, the more I realise that actually - it wasn't very good - and in some scenes\\, just ridiculous.\\n\\nAside from a ridiculous floating\/flying scene in space (which just harms that character in my opinion) I just didn't feel the need to have humour shoved into what felt like every scene. I know it's Disney\\, but you don't apply the \\\"Marvel\\\" formula to Star Wars!\\n\\nIt's about a fairy tale in space not a stand up show proving that every character has a sense of humour. Even writing this now is actually making me angry as I think of even more scenes that were just so out of place from the Star Wars Universe.\\n\\nGo see the film\\, because it's Star Wars & you won't have a clue what's going on in the next film unless you see this\\, but please learn from my mistakes.\\n\\nWhen you leave the theatre you maybe on a high\\, screaming \\\"OMG that was amazing\\, that part with the thing\\, and when they said this and when that happened\\\" jump onto Twitter or Facebook bragging that the film was good and then reigniting that fire in your belly that has dissipated from the last Star Wars film.....\\nThen\\, take a deep breath and listen to that annoying knocking sound in the back of you mind\\, that's your criticism knocking at the door\\, open it - \\\"Hey\\, but what about the other 65% of the movie that just doesn't fit right\\\"\\n\\nThat's where my head is at right now anyway.\\n\\nI just hope that when the next film finally makes for the big screen that someone sits back and goes hey - millions if not billions of lifeforms have died during this power struggle and the fight for freedom - maybe we should make less jokes.\\n\\nMay the force be with you.","true":true}
