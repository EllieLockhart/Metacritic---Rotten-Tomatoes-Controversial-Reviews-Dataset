Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I want to be preached to I will go to church. SJW does not belong in a movie meant to draw people together. You did it\\, you killed the past meaning their will be no life in the future. But the music and special effects were good\\, to bad the story was rotten to the core","true":true}
