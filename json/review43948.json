Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was over hyped the first time I watched it. After watching the original VHS trilogy & prequels\\, I went back and re-watched TFA & TLJ\\, and realized how awful both actually are. Going from 6 to 7 gave me whiplash\\, but nothing compared to this one. Really concerned about #9 now\\, no clue how Disney is going to make this trilogy make anything close to sense.","true":true}
