The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have finished the Last of Us Part II and I must say this really got me. The mechanics\\, the graphics and the sound are great. The way you interact with the environment makes tlou2 a very realistic and immersive experience of its own kind. However the main aspect of games like the last of us\\, the story\\, is really bothering me. The story pretty much starts off with Joel\u2019s death. His death had a very powerful effect on me and most people probably. This death had such a powerful effect not only because of the fact that it is Joel who they killed\\, it\u2019s also the way he got murdered which bothered me a lot. Later the character who killed him\\, Abby\\, was also the one we played for half of the game. This part of the game was a way to make us sympathize with Abby\\, but it didn\u2019t really let me do that. For the entirety of her part\\, I couldn\u2019t care less for what Abby experienced\\, let alone even having any kind of sympathy for this character. It was the opposite: Every time I died as Abby\\, I got happy\\, I cheered. Every time she felt pain\\, I felt pleasure. Every time she experienced lost\\, I experienced fulfillment. The Ellie part compensates until a certain point for the failure of the Abby part\\, but only until Ellie becomes the one who is the most lost. The ending is the ultimate height of futility. What is it even worth trying and fighting for? That\u2019s a question not only Ellie has to ask herself\\, but also the player. What is even the point in playing if every action leads to more loss and loneliness? Perhaps this is what Naughty Dog tried to accomplish and if it were the case\\, then perhaps they had the wrong goal in mind.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
