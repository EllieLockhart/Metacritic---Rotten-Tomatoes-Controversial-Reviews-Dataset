Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A worthy addition to the franchise! There are parts that drag in the middle of the movie but the highlights of the film more than make up for that. Keeps some of the same tropes you come to expect in a Star Wars film but throws enough new twists and turns to keep things fresher than ever.","true":true}
