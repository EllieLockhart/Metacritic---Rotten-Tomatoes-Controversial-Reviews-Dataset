Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a grat addition to the Star Wars universe\\, with new worlds and amazing\\, jaw dropping suprises that will leave any fan shocked. Johnson is able to make it seem like Empire Strikes Back \\, but also adds a lot more to the store to make its own thing. Great endings for well-known characters and starts for others. Mark Hamill surprises all with his best performance yet.","true":true}
