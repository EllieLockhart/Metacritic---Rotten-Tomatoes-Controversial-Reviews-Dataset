Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's fkg great\\, well written\\, beautiful cinematogry and it has the best acting of the whole saga. I think it's funny how Ryan Johnson understands the Force better than Lucas when he did the Prequels\\, he reinvented it and made it interesting. Plus Rose is the most underrated character of Star Wars\\, she's great and it sucks that she got replaced by some dude and just got 2 minutes of screen time in TROS. It's as good as Empire Strikes Back. Anyway great movie watch it","true":true}
