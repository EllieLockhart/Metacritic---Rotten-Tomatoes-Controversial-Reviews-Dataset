Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, I love the Star Wars Cinematic Universe. However\\, what Disney has done here is a travesty. The Luke Skywalker I witnessed in the film was NOT the Luke I grew up with\\, plain and simple. Also\\, there was not plot to the film really\\, just a two and a half hour escape story. Aside from all of this\\, the comedy was way too much. I do not need to see poorly placed jokes in very serious scenes. All in all\\, if Disney wants to scrap this and try again\\, I'm game.","true":true}
