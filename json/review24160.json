Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(May include spoilers) Star Wars: The Last Jedi has nearly everything that is aesthetically Star Wars (explosions\\, space battles\\, lightsabers\\, musical score\\, beautiful set pieces\\, generally good cinematography\\, etc.)\\, but at its core is\\, well\\, nothing. So many of the plot lines do not matter to the end result of the film\\, and virtually no deeply satisfying answers are given to questions left from The Force Awakens. Not what many of us were expecting\\, right? The Last Jedi is nihilism for the big screen coupled with subversive allusions to a political agenda and deconstruction of the traditional Star Wars mythology and nearly everything that was dearly loved about one original trilogy character in particular. For many longtime fans of this storied franchise\\, at its core\\, it feels like hate mail\\, and for what purpose? Well...there's no reason in particular except to try to appeal to a new generation of fans. It calls to mind famous 20th Century plays like Waiting for Godot (a play where nothing happens which I actually thought was quite funny because it did not come after a saga of 7 plays where things actually mattered). All things considered\\, nihilism can provoke interesting thought and discourse about the importance and place of understanding moral positions and worldviews as well as the meaning of life\\, but to place it at the center of a movie which follows 7 saga films all centered on an epic struggle between good and evil is\\, well\\, rather off-putting and deeply disrespectful to many fans of the previous movies. What's more troubling is I'm not sure Rian Johnson or many of the Disney-owned Lucasfilm executives see this as any sort of problem at all.","true":true}
