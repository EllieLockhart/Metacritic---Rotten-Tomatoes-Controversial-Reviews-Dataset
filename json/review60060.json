The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If you're homophobic and sexist and refuse to play a game where the main character isn't a male and where most of the sex is non-heteronormative\\, you'll be unable to understand the plot of this game. If you are literally anyone else who actually paid attention to the story in part 1 and understand that Joel's actions were bound to have consequences and that Joel was a flawed human being\\, you'll be very interested in this game's storyline. The story is very innovative for this medium in that it makes the player think carefully about their character's actions and has you play as the villain almost as much as it has you play as the protagonist. At one point you play as the villain and defeat the protagonist. The game also draws comparisons between the villain and Joel and suggests that Joel is not so different from the woman who kills him. In fact\\, if Joel were in Abby's shoes\\, he undoubtedly would have done the same thing. Like Joel found Ellie\\, Abby finds Lev and grows as human being\\, finds a reason to live again. This is a game that really breaks new ground in storytelling. They found a way to tell a story that can only be done with a videogame. The exploration of how people deal with loss and the consequences is perfectly executed. It's also an intellectually\\, emotionally and morally challenging experience. Players who hate this game don't want a game that forces them to think critically.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
