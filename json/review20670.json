{"101487":146110,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-30","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've spent a lot of time thinking about this movie and\\, quite honestly\\, I have been trying to separate my initial reactions to the film from the onslaught of negativity that has stuck to this film like stink on...um\\, poop.\\n\\nI am just going to write about what I felt about the movie before I read any reviews and then talk briefly about points other people made and whether I agree with them or not.\\n\\nThere is an opening battle at the beginning of the movie that I found quite thrilling and effective. Granted\\, bombs don't work that way in zero gravity\\, but\\, it's a science fiction movie\\, give them a break\\, maybe they are magnetic or something. The opening battle is about bravery and sacrifice. A great start\\, in my opinion.\\n\\nThen\\, for reasons\\, our hotshot pilot gets into trouble and we are either supposed to root for him or side with Princess Leia (yes I know she is a General\\, but she will always be Princess Leia to me). He eventually mutanies after Leia does an impression of Mary Poppins and command is turned over to Laura Dern who the internet tells me is a lesbian because she has blue hair\\, because no one else in the Star Wars universe has weird looking hair. As we learned from the Star Wars prequels\\, nothing is more exciting in a Star Wars movie than people jockeying for power. We also kill off Admiral Ackbar because out with the old\\, in with the new. It's actually very touching how delicately they handled his death and what a shadow this character's death brought to the... oh never mind\\, it is hardly mentioned.\\n\\nFortunately\\, we get to see Rey train with Luke Skywalker. Remember the fun pictures that Mark Hamill posted of Daisy Ridley riding on his back reenacting his training with Yoda from Empire? That was more fun than the dour\\, boring Luke that poor Mark is made to play in this movie. We also get to learn that milking cows is gross and eating meat is bad. I am not kidding when I say that this movie spent precious screen time and significant resources (both practical effects and digital effects) for the sole purpose of making people feel grossed out about drinking milk or eating meat. These scenes had no bearing on the plot.  The training of Luke in Empire was amazing. In Last Jedi\\, it is a bore with forced humor that rarely lands. Remember all the funny\\, slapstick comedy from the original Star Wars trilogy? Yeah\\, me neither.\\n\\nMaking sure to not make the same mistake that the prequels made by using 100% green screen to make new words completely in the computer\\, the movie sends the least interesting character Finn\\, the sister of a character that sacrifices herself in the cool opening scene\\, and BB-8 to a world that is made completely in the computer with mostly CGI creatures and environments. Fortunately\\, we get the important message that coal miners are evil\\, horse racing is evil\\, and people that don't allow people to use beach property that they own are also evil. The 1% are also evil. The entire scene on the planet Canto Bight serves no other purpose. The spend about 20 minutes on this planet to make the above political points because nothing else happens here. If you enjoy watching humans riding CGI character's through CGI environments than boy do I have a movie that I can recommend to you.\\n\\nI tried to ignore the fact that Finn and crew escape from a ship that is being hunted by the First Order only to return to the ship being pursued by the First Order. I was only moderately successful in suspending my disbelief on this plot hole.\\n\\nFortunately\\, Rey and Kylo end up having one of the best lightsaber battles in Star Wars history which is why I give this movie as \\\"high\\\" of a rating as I do. Unfortunately\\, said battle is preceded by one of the lamest deaths in Star Wars history. It makes Boba Fett falling into the Sarlacc Pit seem epic in scale by comparison.\\n\\nThis movie has several opportunities to give Princess Leia a proper\\, amazing send off\\, but is too scared to use them. They change Luke's personality so much\\, that I have to think that it is intentional\\, so we won't miss him if he were to (ahem) disappear.\\n\\nWe get a sort of battle between Luke and Kylo which could have been awesome\\, but isn't. We also get most of the Rebel alliance killed off for no real good reason and with very little payoff.\\n\\nIn short\\, the movie has two cool scenes. The space battles are amazing. The special effects\\, except on the Vegas planet\\, are great. Sound is spot on. There is humor in places it doesn't belong. And I really resented the vegan\\, anti 1% message in my Star Wars movie. Oh\\, and they ruined Luke. Yes\\, they managed to make the hero of the original trilogy lame. This is probably the biggest sin of all.\\n\\nFor the past few months I have been reading review after review absolutely trashing this movie and I learned one more thing that I hadn't thought of. The whole point of the original trilogy is Luke seeing good in his father. He risks his life to confront him\\, not murder him. This movie\\, however\\, suggests that this same character would commit unjustified homicide against a family member because he is worried they might be evil. The argument is that this movie literally ruins Luke's legacy and the more I think about it\\, the more I have to come to the conclusion that they are right.\\n\\nAnother point that I hadn't considered is that this movie gives you nothing to look forward to in the next movie. Force Awakens asked a bunch of questions and had you looking forward to Rey's training. What is there to look forward to in the next movie? Can't wait to see how they kill Leia off? Will it be part of the opening crawl (which is my guess)? Will we get to see more of the amazing chemistry between Finn and Rose ??? Um\\, could someone tell me what to look forward to? Other than it being called Star Wars\\, why am I going to watch the next movie?\\n\\nWith Solo right around the corner\\, I've got a bad feeling about this.","true":true}
