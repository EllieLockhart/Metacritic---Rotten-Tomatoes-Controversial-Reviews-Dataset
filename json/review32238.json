Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars episode 8 is a good movie but not a great movie and leaves episode 9 with very little to look forward too. With Carrie Fishers passing Star Wars is now without all three of the stars who made the originals what they are. It seemed like the goal of episode 8 was to completely undo what the Force Awakens built and that's the trouble you run into without someone planning all three episodes out as a single story.","true":true}
