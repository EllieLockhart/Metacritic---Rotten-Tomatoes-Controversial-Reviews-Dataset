Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a challenging film.\\nIt's not just Empire Strikes Back again\\, yet\\, it is.\\nRian Johnson decided not to just have a \\\"I am your father\\\" moment\\, rather\\, he opted to make the entire film one big plot twist. \\nThis film is something Star Wars desperately needed. It challenges not only *what* a Star Wars film is and should be\\, but *why*. It shows us why our obsession with mythical figures like Luke Skywalker is harmful\\, and also hopeful. And it reminds us that Good and Evil are the same coin.\\n\\nIt's also very\\, very bloated. It's simply too long for not good enough reasons. The entire Canto Bight sequence\\, though filmed beautifully\\, is awkward and does not contribute enough to actual plot\\, even if it does so for the theme and characters. \\n\\nBottom line: This movie is fantastic\\, but it's also complicated. Casual fans will fall in love. Hardcore fans might need a week to process what happened.","true":true}
