Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Somewhere in here is a fantastic film. Rian Johnson is a fantastic director but his neglect of the editing room is the downfall of this unfortunate mess. Constantly changing tone coupled with poorly executed slapstick shreds any building tension to shreds\\, while a potentially satisfying conclusion is thwarted by another forty minutes of explosions.","true":true}
