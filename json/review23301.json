Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! No complaints at all\\, too many people are getting upset that it\u2019s not like the old movies. It\u2019s 2017 and not 1977 so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not going to be like the original. Kylo Ren was my favorite ","true":true}
