Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This pile of rancid garbage is the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. This movie is so bad that I take back everything negative I said about the prequels. I am convinced Rian Johnson's only research was the Star Wars Christmas Special before calling it good enough and embarking on his quest to kill Star Wars forever. Why else would he systematically throw out 40 years of Star Wars history in favor of creating \\\"Star Wars the Teen Space Musical\\\". We are now supposed to be believe that none of the rules matter\\, anyone can do anything\\, and randomly jumping around a nonsensical plot about new characters we don't care about is the best way to continue the franchise. I am so disgusted I will not be seeing episode IX. Not even JJ Abrams can fix this kind of damage.","true":true}
