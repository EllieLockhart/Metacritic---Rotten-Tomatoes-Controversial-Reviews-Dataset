Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, loved almost everything about it\\, I thought one of the movie arcs\\, was kinda boring\\, but that was not enough to take the smile out of my face the entire movie. Other great thing of that movie it is his beautiful scenes. All the actors did a great job on the characters\\, really sad about Carrie Fisher not being around us anymore... Probably you already watched it\\, but if not\\, I recommend you to watch it\\, not going to disappoint you. In my personal opinion\\, The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars Movie to date\\, followed by Return Of The Jedi\\, Empire Strikes Back and The Revenge Of The Sith. I hope Solo is even better.","true":true}
