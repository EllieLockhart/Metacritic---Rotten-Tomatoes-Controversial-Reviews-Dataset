Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I started playing the game 3 days before my father\u2019s Memorial Day. It\u2019s 14 years since he\u2019s gone. He was a great man and passed away on speed. Before his death my parents fell out due to his mistakes as a family man and he had been living apart from us for 6 months. The saddest thing was that we never really appreciated him\\, despite his several mistakes as a husband and father\\, and that we didn\u2019t live together when this happened.And I couldn\u2019t be more shocked when I finished the game on the 29th of July\\, 4 hours into the Memorial Day. I couldn\u2019t be more schooled how this game and its complexity corresponded with my feelings. I blamed mom\\, I blamed his drunk friends who let him sit in the car\\, I blamed everyone. But overtime I realized just as Ellie that we should just let go. And it\u2019s been 2 days I\u2019ve crying these tears\\, never as much as I used at the fall of July.10\/10\\, thank you for the game\\, Naughty Dog.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
