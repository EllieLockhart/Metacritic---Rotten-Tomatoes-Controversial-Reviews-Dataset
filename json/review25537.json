Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"NO SPOILERS: This movie was cinematically wonderful. It wove together the story of The Force at work in beloved characters old and new\\, but it distinctly told a new story. This was both a blast of fresh air into a franchise that was beginning to feel stale\\, and it was a masterfully relatable work of exciting and emotionally explosive storytelling. It felt like a session of bingewatching an entire season of a well made show with multiple storylines\\, action and character development somehow magically condensed into 2.5 hours of which NOT ONE MINUTE was boring. I really came away not only adoring this movie but thinking about so many of it's meaningful scenes again and against and again. This film is destined to be one that influences the way we think about the world\\, and it has truly earned that right.","true":true}
