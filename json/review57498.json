Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This should summarize the billiance of this movie\\n\\nTop notch characterization:\\n\\nRey- Learned she was nobody\\, so it's severely affected her outlook on the world by changing nothing about her.\\n\\nRen- Didn't kill his mom\\, then talks about how Luke almost killing him made him want to kill everyone\\, creating an absurd amount of sympathy for him to kill the past by killing the Resistance based on his past.\\n\\nFinn- Tried to act like a hero\\, failed\\, then killed Plasma\\, then failed. Learned to protect people by not protecting people.\\n\\nRose- Had her sister sacrifice herself\\, so tells Finn not to sacrifice himself for the cause. Learned to love a person for no appealing traits.\\n\\nPoe- Gets demoted for two seconds\\, tries to save everyone from dying since leadership has no plan\\, learning to be a leader by mind reading Luke and regurgitating phrases.\\n\\nLuke- Attempts to kill nephew\\, then stops right before\\, nephew killed everyone under him except non-existent knights of ren. Got depressed and learned to not be a complete wimp\\, right before dying like a wimp.\\n\\nThis movie changes my life. By not only subverting my expectations\\, but also having nothing make sense in the plot\\, like the code cracker knowing about the secret escape from the shuttle through the Force. I thought they would make an interesting movie\\, but I got nonsensical. 9.5\/10\\nNot enough porg\\n\\nEdit: Oh my goodness\\, how could I forget! When Rey asks why he killed his dad\\, he is trying to distract her from the question by being topless. This adds a whole new layer of how nefarious and capable he is. It works too\\, because he doesn't answer the question and she not only forgets about it\\, but feel even more sympathy for him. Thanks for reminding me of a crucial part of Johnson's bold vision of nonsense. Let me bump the score up to properly include this.?\\n9.8\/10?","true":true}
