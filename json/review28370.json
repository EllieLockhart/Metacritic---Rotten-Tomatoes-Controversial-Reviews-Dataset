Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Possibly the best of the franchise but absolutely the best since Empire. Where The Force Awakens succeeded by playing to the familiar Star Wars formula\\, The Last Jedi does so by standing on it's own 2 feet. It's thoroughly self aware\\, leading the audience down familiar alleyways but ultimately subverting the plot just when you think it's going to be Empire Part 2. TLJ is darker\\, wittier and without doubt the most original piece of Star Wars property in decades.","true":true}
