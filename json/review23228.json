Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! I\u2019m genuinely shocked by the number of negative reviews from fans. It was funny\\, touching and visually stunning. There are still so many unanswered questions\\, but I\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll be addressed in the next one. It certainly has an entirely different feel from The Force Awakens and the original trilogy\\, but I think it only expanded the universe in a good\\, just different way. Why would you want to recreate the originals? That\u2019s what people complained about with Ep 7. I like that they\u2019re each different\\, and I absolutely enjoyed the hell out of this one.","true":true}
