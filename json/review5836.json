Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed. The unfunny puns in the style of the Avengers are one of its worst aspects. Absurd scenes which shouldn't have appeared like the one with Leia and the explosion\\, or final battle are just nonsense. Also the introduction of new characters was made very poorly. I would qualify this movie in Top 3 of the worst Star Wars Episodes.","true":true}
