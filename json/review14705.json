Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never rated a movie before.  As an avid star wars fan who went into this film with nothing but good intentions i came out utterly disappointed. misfire for sure.  I am so disappointed I am on here to share it.  Hopefully J.J. Abrams can redeem this travesty.","true":true}
