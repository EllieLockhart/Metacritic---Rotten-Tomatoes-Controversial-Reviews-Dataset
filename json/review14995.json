Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just watched this movie for the 2nd time and I can tell you it will go down as one of the best in the entire saga\\, it\u2019s an instant classic. It\u2019s funny reading the reviews you\u2019d think some people are reviewing completely different movies than others. This is a fantastic\\, classic style Star Wars movie. If you like those you will love this movie\\, if you don\u2019t you probably won\u2019t. I\u2019m a Star Wars fan\\, always have been\\, so I loved it. If you\u2019re going in expecting starship troopers then this isn\u2019t for you. ","true":true}
