Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst. Star Wars. Movie. It was a big slap in the face to fans of the series.\\nUntil now I didn't think I had it in myself to say something negative about a Star Wars movie (I would even defend Jar Jar..)\\, but it was BAD.\\nHow can you make such iconic characters so UNLIKABLE? Especially the new characters\\, who won me over in the last film.\\n\\nI never thought I'd ever have to talk myself out of walking out of a Star Wars movie. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I gave it so many chances to redeem itself\\, but it really did just get worse and worse. By the end\\, all I could say while I was walking out was \\\"What the hell just happened?\\\" I have no intentions on watching it again.\\nI truly have to believe any raving reviews are paid for by Disney.\\n\\nI'm trying to convince myself it was all just a very bad dream.","true":true}
