Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unnecessarily long\\, boring\\, bad subplots\\, bad new characters and bland humor\\, at least have beautiful scenes and the interaction between Kylo and Rey is very good even if it is very run down.","true":true}
