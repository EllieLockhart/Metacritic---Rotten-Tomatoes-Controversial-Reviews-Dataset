Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant film\\, an original story instead of the fan service that the force awakens was that kept me on the edge of my seat. I don't care what anyone else say this is the best Star Wars film since Empire it not better","true":true}
