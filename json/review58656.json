We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"\\\"The Last of Us\\\" was the closest we will get to playing Cormac McCarthy's \\\"The Road\\\".  It was an absolutely stunning game that elevated the medium in nearly every conceivable way.  There was no need for a sequel as the narrative ended on such a poignant moment of universal insight and reflection\\, that to attempt a sequel would risk destroying that prior accomplishment.\r\rNaughty Dog went ahead and developed a sequel regardless. While Part 1 was \\\"The Road\\\"\\, Part II is The Last of Us by way of \\\"Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West\\\".  It stands as the single most unrelenting nihilistic narrative I've ever experienced\\, and will likely ever experience\\, in the medium.  The game will not please everyone\\, but the first title didn't offer a traditionally satisfying narrative either.  The developers seemingly wallow in misery\\, but do so with a clear purpose.  Many other reviewers here have marked the title down (some illegitimate\\, far fewer who have actually played the game to completion) because of the punches this game refuses to pull.  They are experiencing the stages of grief.  Their reviews exist as funeral pyres for fictitious characters they thought deserved better.  I don't disagree that some of these characters deserved better.  I would have liked to believe that there was light in the darkness.  That's not the narrative that is being told here.  It hurts.\r\rThis is not the game many people wanted to play.  Neil Druckmann has crafted a fetid existential wasteland of the soul.  This does not mean this is a bad game.  It's truly a remarkable accomplishment on every front.  While I was one of the people who did not want a sequel to Part I\\, now that we have Part II\\, I would adore a Part III\\, if for no other reason than to hold out hope that \\\"it can't be for nothing.\\\"\u2026 Expand","true":true}
