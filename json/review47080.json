Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible direction to take starwars in\\, throwing out all the great novels and fanfiction is one thing\\, but theres no sense of Grace\/nobility\/moral purpose\\,  it's missing the whole air of starwars.  The conflict between the light\/dark seems shallow\\, not deep rooted and sinister like the original 6.  I call for a redo.","true":true}
