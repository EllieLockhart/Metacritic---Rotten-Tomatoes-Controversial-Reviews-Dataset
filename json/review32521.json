Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Bold and New?\\nLet's talk about a film that lacked the proper execution.\\n\\nThe one constant thing I keep hearing and reading about\\, is that those who disliked The Last Jedi\\, just don't like change\\, the \\\"bold and new\\\" directions\\, the \\\"left turns\\\"\\, or that we just don't want to let go of the past.\\n\\nAs a quick aside\\, I find it interesting that all the big press outlets and the trendy\/indie Star Wars outlets are all peddling the same line about this movie being \\\"bold and new while honoring the legacy\\\". Is this line coming straight from a Disney press packet with a check inside? I digress.\\n\\n[spoilers below]\\n\\nMany are completely missing why some of us did not like this movie as much as we should have. I submit that you can still have \\\"bold and new\\\" all while staying on point with what Star Wars is\\, and has been. You can still go in new directions without plot holes and thin characters getting in the way.\\n\\nJust some quick questions to ponder as you read on.\\n\\nAre little to no lightsaber fights\\, bold and new?\\nAre thin character arcs (Rey\\, Finn\\, Snoke\\, Holdo)\\, bold and new?\\nIs having no real lead character\\, bold and new?\\nAre plot devices with too many holes\\, bold and new?\\n\\nTo me\\, it feels like those defending the film as \\\"the second best Star Wars ever\\\" are saying \\\"yes\\\" to the above questions\\, subconsciously or not. I also think there is a political lens some of the young fans are using to view this movie and they will like it no matter what\\, because of that lens. Not everything has to be filtered through a politically charged lens.\\n\\nThis blows my mind.\\n\\nAgain\\, those who take issue with the movie are not saying they don't want or can't take any change to the Star War universe\\, they are just saying that the issues listed above and below\\, are too hard to ignore. Any film with these types of core plot and character issues would be slammed.\\nI really appreciated and enjoyed what The Force Awakens established\\, it felt like a Star Wars film to me\\, even though it 'shadow boxed' A New Hope. It respected the heritage\\, as it should have. That said\\, I very much welcomed a new direction for Star Wars\\, something with new and fresh twists. I believe that this can be done while respecting nostalgia and the original trilogy. The fans need and want this\\, and they always will as long as the original trilogy is cherished. Sorry\\, it's just a hard fact.\\n\\nI totally get that The Last Jedi was trying to give us a fresh take. I am not at all against pushing what we know about the Star Wars universe. It took me about five days to digest and absorb what I saw with The Last Jedi. I am actually fine with the overall direction that was attempted with The Last Jedi\\, I just feel it was done in a way that fell very flat. It didn't feel like Star Wars. It should have. I say this not because my fan theories were not met\\, but because the core mechanics that make a Star Wars movie 'good'\\, felt very broken. These movies should always feel like a Star Wars movie\\, whether a new direction or an old nostalgic direction.\\n\\nLet that sink it.\\n\\nI feel like the super fans of The Last Jedi are defending and cheering the idea of \\\"bold and new\\\"\\, implying that it should equate to something that doesn't feel like Star Wars. This is that is what they are using as their gauge for whether it is \\\"bold and new\\\" enough.\\n\\nThe issues that I have with The Last Jedi simply have to do with the poor execution of the plot\\, the squandered character arcs\\, and the poorly conceived comedy. My issues are not related to any dashed fan theories and bitterness around that\\, although\\, for some\\, that is their main grievance. For some\\, it didn't go the way they thought it was going to go. This is not my main issue with the film.\\n\\nWhile it is true that the films in the original trilogy all have similar issues with execution in some form or another\\, The Last Jedi is so consistent in poor execution\\, it only compounds why I am not a fan...right now (Star Wars movies seem to get better with age). To be clear\\, I am not even referring to issues with the Star Wars mythology at this point\\, but the simple rules that any good film should follow to ensure a quality movie\\, especially one that is part of a trilogy.\\n\\nSo\\, what are my issues with The Last Jedi?\\n\\nOut of gas in space.\\nFirst\\, being \\\"out of gas\\\" in space as a plot device is not bold\\, or pushing a new direction. Stop ignoring how this was a bad base premise. This should have been expanded or replaced as a plot device. The story and direction would have only been stronger\\, and possibly it would have expanded the feeling of scope\\, which felt very small.\\n\\nHoldo's tight lips\\, sinking ships.\\nHoldo not sharing her plan with Poe is not a bold new direction\\, it's a plot hole due to shoddy writing. This could have been cleaned up with a few lines to justify why she did this\\, but they left that plot hole wide open.\\n\\nCaptain Phasma.\\nCaptain Phasma was treated like a pointless character. This is not a bold new direction\\, it was a waste.\\n\\nSuper Leia.\\nLeia \\\"flying\\\" through space the way she did could have been done differently\\, or better\\, so as not to be a meme in the making. Maybe she could have \\\"force called\\\" to Luke\\, and he moves her via the force? I don't know\\, but it could have been done better. Her using the force (while looking weird at that angle) has nothing to do with being bold\\, or new. It was just bad. Also\\, she uses the force to \\\"fly\\\"\\, at the beginning of the movie\\, but she does nothing with the force at the end of the movie to maybe move the rocks? Why? Plot hole. Bad writing. Again\\, this is not a \\\"new direction vs legacy direction\\\" debate\\, it's a bad filmmaking vs good filmmaking debate. Also\\, why did Leia and Kylo have zero interaction in this movie? At least a force interaction\\, something! This was a missed opportunity.\\n\\nLuke. Not Luke.\\nLuke comically discarding the lightsaber\\, this should not have been as flippant. Sure\\, the direction and motive of disgust still could have been the same\\, just executed better than to turn it into a slapstick joke. Jokes are fine\\, and it was funny\\, but it was all wrong. Respect the heritage of what the lightsaber represents. I submit that respect while being new\\, is possible.\\n\\nI agree with what Mark Hamill said to Rian Johnson after first reading the script. He said the following\\, \\\"I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character.\\\"\\n\\nSuper Rey.\\nRey\\, although mysteriously powerful by default\\, had no real force training time with Luke. Why? By not explaining this\\, or expanding on this\\, is that bold and new?\\n\\nThe casino.\\nThe whole casino side mission. No question that this was not bold or new. That was an utter waste of time. We all agree\\, so let's move on.\\n\\nSnoke\\, the all powerful.\\nSnoke can read minds and is all powerful\\, but Kylo fooled him? I am fine with this\\, but writing and direction are very muddy here. There should have been more of a nod (at some point) to the fact that Kylo had the ability to 'block' Snoke's force abilities. Also\\, what a waste of a build-up of a big bad character. Was this considered to be bold\\, to build up Snoke\\, then kill him so flippantly (although a cool death)? Maybe it was just lazy writing. I found it a cheap way to undo what The Force Awakens set up for us\\, not bold. Another wasted character. Having thin or wasted characters is not a bold \\\"left turn\\\". It's just bad storytelling. This applies to any movie.\\n\\nWhere are the lightsabers?\\nOnly one real lightsaber battle. Was this a bold move to only have one real lightsaber battle? Lightsaber battles are a core of Star Wars\\, but it seems like the defenders of The Last Jedi are saying that it is\/was a good thing to 'toss' it all out. I find this attitude to be a betrayal of what Star Wars is\\, and will always be\\, whether a new direction or not. As a side note (not a real issue)\\, we have always had some sort of fun alien monster threat in all the movies too. We didn't get that. I think it is fair to expect that in a Star Wars movie\\, new direction or not.\\n\\nNo more Luke.\\nLuke used the force too much\\, and that killed him? I find that his death was just tacked on. The scene was amazing\\, but it was tacked on. Ok\\, take Luke out of the picture. Fine\\, let's move on\\, I get it\\, but something felt very off about this. It felt unfinished. The \\\"fight\\\" with Kylo even felt cheap and thin (no real lightsaber battle). We all know we need a bit more time with Luke after that rushed redemption arc. Be honest.\\n\\nNo more lead character.\\nFinally\\, there was no real lead character. This is not bold\\, and this issue has nothing to do with Star Wars being new and bold\\, and different. This is just bad writing showing it's ugly hand again. Why was Rey barely in the final act? Those that praise this movie as \\\"bold and new\\\" are missing the fact that Rey was regulated to a character that no longer felt like the main protagonist. If the movie was doing this to be \\\"bold\\\"\\, then they failed. This is filmmaking 101\\, you need a main protagonist. So\\, if they got Rey all wrong\\, you must shift and consider that this movie was not the genius piece of art that it is being hailed as. It is sloppy and thin.\\n\\nThis movie could have been truly special with some tweaks here and there\\, but The Last Jedi decided to leave in the glaring plot holes\\, ignore characters and disrespect the greater Star Wars universe that was created before it\\, all in the name of being \\\"bold and new\\\". But was it? I say no\\, it wasn't bold\\, or new. It was broken\\, so I guess you can say that is 'new'.\\n\\nStar Wars can be bold\\, and it can be new. I am all for it\\, but I still submit that bold and new can be accomplished while showing more respect to the past\\, paying better attention to the plot holes\\, character arcs\\, and the fine details all at the same time.\\n\\nTo The Last Jedi super defender fans\\, please stop confusing \\\"bold and new\\\" with \\\"lazy and shoddy\\\".\\n\\nHelp me JJ Abrams\\, you're my only hope.","true":true}
