Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Gameplay mechanics- Smooth but straight out of 2013 with the exception of adding a jump action which is honestly pointless and going prone which I did enjoy.\r\rGraphics-  Absolutely beautiful the best probably I\u2019ve ever seen on any game but honestly from a AAA company that is to be expected. Graphics do nothing but get improved for games of this standard.\r\rStory- How in the world can you take two beloved characters and completely spit on them. They were villainized the whole game for their actions. But on the other hand we\u2019re supposed to feel sympathy for the other main character who brutally murders one of the first beloved characters in front of the other beloved character in the waking moments of the game. The way I see it when you play as Ellie you are forced to commit very gruesome morally corrupt actions she tries to refrain from until she has to defend her self. They try to make you feel bad for killing NPC\u2019s with names but if you go and try to play stealthily add get caught they will murder you on the spot.  We are supposed to love this new character\\, but here is my problem with that when Ellie murders a pregnant woman in complete self-defense without knowing she was pregnant has a panic attack and vomits immediately. Abby gets the chance to murder a pregnant woman and literally is about to enjoy it for revenge until her new little best friend stops her whom she used to murder for sport. I just feel like the whole revenge plot for Ellie is revenge is bad but on the other hand for Abby it\u2019s just dust in the wind she can get revenge and it\u2019s no problem because she is entitled to it. To me I feel like a couple years ago they had a whole different plan for this game but suddenly decided to change it up and rushed it. I could keep writing and making random points but honestly the sequel doesn\u2019t deserve it.  At the end of the day myself as a fan is very crushed\\, I waited seven years after playing that first beautiful game to get this terrible sequel. It is just sad they did my favorite characters in a game so dirty and they did me dirty. You Dirty Naughty Dog.\r\rTo wrap it up I ask what is the point of a mechanically beautiful and graphically gorgeous game if the story is going to be so shallow and a complete 180 of what the first one stood for. What I wanted was to see where the story kept going for the two characters I loved. Now I just wish I never bought this second game what a disappointment. All I can do now is try and forget I ever played it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
