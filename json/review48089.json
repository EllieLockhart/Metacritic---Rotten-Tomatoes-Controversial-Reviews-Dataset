Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Last Jedi had some flaws (Rose mainly)\\, it brings something new and very interesting to Star Wars.  It brings ourselves to a point where the whole plot resolves around 2 characters and their feelings instead of the repetitive inter-galactic warfare Episode VII gave us by basically redoing the plot of A New Hope.  It also describes what few understood from the prequels : nothing is all black or white\\, the Jedi Order failed because of their flaws\\, not because of the Dark Side.  Luke in this movie is the incarnation of this idea by being the broken old man that is so drastically different from the Luke we left in Episode VI.","true":true}
