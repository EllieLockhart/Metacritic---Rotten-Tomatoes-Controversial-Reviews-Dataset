Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the film is written on par with a bad TV show that everyone criticizes for it's bad writing. The twists that all of the reviews talk about were very telegraphed to the point where you are just waiting for the scene to catch up to where you know it's going. The visuals are still good\\, I mean it's not like they halved the budget from the last one so it's as expected. The space battles are good in this one though. \\n\\nIf you go in expecting a direct to dvd movie you might enjoy it\\, but I wouldn't expect much else.","true":true}
