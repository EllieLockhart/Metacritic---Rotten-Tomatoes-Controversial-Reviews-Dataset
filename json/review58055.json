Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With Episode 8 finally released\\, there was more at stake and almost a possible loss of hope. First off\\, people off that this could be Empire Strikes Back\\, it wasn't. Definitely no huge similarities in terms of plot\\, Definitely more original but there was a lot of nostalgia on this one. So\\, first off\\, this movie is quite epic in its story. Much of it was well done\\, especially with Poe Dameron. Unlike TFA\\, Poe Dameron was a far more interesting character that you want to root for. Not like I wasn't already rooting for him\\, but he shines on as potential new Han Solo into this new series\\, which is why I was so happy that he was developed and mostly awesome in this movie. He definitely felt heroic and that comes from the great acting by Oscar Isaac. As for Kylo Ren\\, I feel like it did get a bit complex with him. In terms of story itself though I felt that there were definitely some storylines that weren't exactly necessary and could have cut off about 15 minutes of the movie. This was more towards the Finn storyline that I felt was not too bad but was redundant. I felt a bit mixed about the development for Luke Skywalker\\, which may feel like a slap to fans and that may include myself. He felt a bit differently from the Skywalker that we grew and loved\\, but I didn't feel truly ecstatic with how they did it. Nevertheless\\, they did somewhat redeem his character at the end. Obviously\\,  it was very very emotional just to see no other than General Leia... Damn those feels hurt. It definitely has everything from laughter and hope to suspense and emotions. There was a lot more risks in this movie that both helped and hurt the story in a way. You will see why. There was definitely a lot of cheery moments\\, especially during the end of the 2nd act and 3rd act. Lastly\\, there will be some strong strong nostalgia that it warmth my heart for. The action sequences were great\\, especially in the end and the beginning. However\\, I wish there was more lightsaber fighting moments that I felt was lacking. Overall\\, I can't really say I loved it because there were some issues with the movie in terms of the storytelling. It is actually a lot of things to just digest to really even grasp what you saw. I don't know if I can even say I loved loved it but I can say it was a good enough movie. I'm definitely watching it again tomorrow\\, so maybe I can get a final reaction about the movie. Nevertheless\\, it was good\\, but I would recommend giving it at least two watches before you can really give a full opinion about it.","true":true}
