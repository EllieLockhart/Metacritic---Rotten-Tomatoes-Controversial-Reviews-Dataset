Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It provided some very shocking twists while introducing some controversial themes. So I expect it may not be an instant favourite with some fans but with the epic action scenes and the pure magic it will be enough for others. It is a very different formula to other Star Wars films and at points ridiculous and convenient\\, overall it is another entertaining but different type of addition to the collection.","true":true}
