Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Um enredo p\u00e9ssimo\\, raso\\, com uma das piores dire\u00e7\u00f5es que j\u00e1 vi. Incr\u00edvel como os di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o fracos e as interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es dos atores pioraram de um filme para o outro! O diretor e roteirista\\, em busca de uma \\\"renova\u00e7\u00e3o\\\" da s\u00e9rie\\, destr\u00f3i personagens cl\u00e1ssicos. Pelo menos Mark Hamill falou a verdade em suas primeiras entrevistas sobre o filme. Rian Johnson\\, que vergonha!","true":false}
