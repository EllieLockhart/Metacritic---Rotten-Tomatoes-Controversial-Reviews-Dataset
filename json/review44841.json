Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly shocked at the lacklustre writing and  poor character development.  As a long time Star Wars fan\\, this was a huge disappointment\\, to have taken one of the most beloved Star Wars characters and turn't him into a joke is mind boggling. The biggest disgrace of it all has to be the out of placed and forced 'Disney' humour\\, apparently it isn't enough to add in cheap gimmicky characters for the sake of selling merchandise..they also need to constantly whip out a cheap joke to completely ruin any form of tension and suspense. Worst of the entire saga by far.","true":true}
