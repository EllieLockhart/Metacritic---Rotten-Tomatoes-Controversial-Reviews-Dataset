Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a good super production stand alone movie to look at. HTe visuals are amazing (probably the best in the Star Wars universe) and the production is definitely what's best out there.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars movie I hated it. \\nIt does not participate in building an universe and in that sense far worse than the prequels. I did not particularly enjoyed the Force Awakens but it was relevant to the Star Wars universe and did initiate a few intriguing sublots. Most of these subplots are dropped here to focus on the vision Rian Johnson had.","true":true}
