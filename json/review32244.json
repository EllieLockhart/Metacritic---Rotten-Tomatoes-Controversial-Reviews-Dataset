Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STAR WARS: EPISODE IX THE MILKY WAY\\nScroll....music starts...I'm Star Warsing Dude!\\nIt is a dark time in the Galaxy of Lucasia\\nQueen Rey's incredible new force powers\\nSense that some men may still not vote for\\nA women\\, even though just because....\\nPulling herself up by her own bootstraps\\, Rey\\nSets out to Jakku to find her lost parents.

(Music swells\\, looks off into space for several minutes) Then she notices\\nLuke\\, now a force ghost\\, getting milk from his beloved space dinosaur.

They decide to raise the\\ndead with a musical number. What follows is an awesome duet of \\\"Let it go\\\" voiced by a couple of\\nforgettable \\\"The Voice\\\" contestants. There are dancing animals and sparkles. Then Reys parents appear.\\nThey are both Rey\\, only one has short hair and a beard. They explain that In the near future Empress Rey\\nwill be so powerful she uses her new and very logical new force power of time travel to go back and be \\nher own parents.
