Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find this the best starwars movie so far. I does not take itself too seriously and this added  a new level to it for me. The jokes are a bit like guardian of the galaxy but finally its not at the jarjarbings level.","true":true}
