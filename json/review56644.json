Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi should be titled the Last Stupid Star Wars. Come on all the build up from the Force Awakens wasted like turd. Very inconsistent and disrespectful to the achivements of the original franchise and trilogy. Maybe Marvel Studios and the Star Wars production team collaborated as I swear to Bitch Supreme Snoke the humor mirrors that of Marvel's. God Damn on what you did to Luke too. It's like just throw away Luke's character and make him a bitter \\, whiny \\, useless \\, tit squeezing old fart. Seriously it is absolutely disgusting for him to be portrayed like that. The movie itself is mildly enjoyable with a lot of sub boring plots that is reminiscent of Turdformers that proved to be useless in the end. I left the theaters jaded and damn you Disney for ruining the core characters and your overly feminist bullshit. Nonetheless I still like what you did to Rogue One. I will still watch Episode 9 just to confirm that you really want to ruin Star Wars but I will never patronize your commercialization of Star Wars and dupe me into buying your abominations like the Porgs or Vader plushies. The Last Jedi is poorly written and it seemed as if it was made to troll the fans while introducing a bunch of mutant force users. Send the   Sentinels Fox Studios and put them all to Genoshia.","true":true}
