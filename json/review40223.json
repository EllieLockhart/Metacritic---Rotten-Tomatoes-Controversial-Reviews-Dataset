Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the Luke Skywalker I grew up with.  Luke's actions in this movie are not true to the character.  Also\\, my favorite new trilogy character\\, Po Dameron\\, acts like an irrational hothead throughout this movie.  Only the female characters are allowed to act rationally or heroically.  Leia flies through space like Mary Poppins.  So many plot holes.  This is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars since Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
