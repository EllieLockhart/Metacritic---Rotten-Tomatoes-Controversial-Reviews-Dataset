Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely enjoyable movie to watch. Definitely had its weaknesses\\, and I\u2019m not sure I agree where the film took Luke and the Skywalker legacy. But I don\u2019t understand all the hate either. The movie brought some interesting nuance to SW. ","true":true}
