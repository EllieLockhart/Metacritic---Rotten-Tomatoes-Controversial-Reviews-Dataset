Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed with what they did with Luke's character. If they were going to kill him off I wish they would have made him more like the force that he was instead of such a joke! I think they got creative with the film\\, but without paying tribute to the original characters that made Star Wars what it was.","true":true}
