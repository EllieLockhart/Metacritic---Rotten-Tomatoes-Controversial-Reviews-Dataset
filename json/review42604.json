Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awful. Made a rotten tomatoes account just to say it. Too many subplots\\, too many characters. All the time is spent on attempted character development for random\\, new and unimportant characters\\, most of whom have no real connection to the overall story arch for both this trilogy as well as star wars as a whole. This occurs whilst other hugely important characters are given very little screen time and then killed off unceremoniously. The continued attempts at childish humour were grossly unnecessary\\, misguided and misplaced. I was extremely disappointed and for the life of me cannot see how critics enjoyed this piece of trash\\, which went out of its way to cater to the lowest common denominator.","true":true}
