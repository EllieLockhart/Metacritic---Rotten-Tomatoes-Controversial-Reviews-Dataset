Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How?  How did this movie pass the sniff test???  I would assume that there is a line of people that need to sign off on a movie before it actually hits theaters.  How in the hell did this movie get through casting\\, screenwriting\\, performing\\, editing and producing to actually hitting screens all around the world?\\n\\nHow did anyone not say at any point that this film was a little sexist?  How did they cast who they did?  How did they allow the horrendous Rose to see the light of day?  Who actually approved of Leia flying?  WHy did they think we needed to see Luke milking the teats of a sea cow?  Where is the douche who wrote the terrible jokes into this mess?\\n\\nSo many questions\\, so few answers....kind of like the plot of this movie.","true":true}
