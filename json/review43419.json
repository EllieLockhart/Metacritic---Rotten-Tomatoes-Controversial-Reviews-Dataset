Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a phenomenal entry into the Star Wars universe that dared to challenge the expectations of fans\\, delivering a film that reimagined the franchise whilst building on its most successful tropes. It was dramatic\\, sinister and beautifully shot\\, depicting a struggle between light and dark\\, hope and hate that felt totally plausible and human whilst remaining true to the at times far fetched reality of the galaxy far far away.","true":true}
