Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"DO. NOT. SEE. Makes Phantom Menace look good. HOW did you think making a Star Wars movie with no lightsaber duels was a good idea????? The hell with you Disney\\, not watching any more of this crap","true":true}
