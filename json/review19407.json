Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's simply great because its different and unexpected. Something Star Wars hasn't done in a long time. The acting\\, pacing\\, cinematography\\, and score is superb. It wasn't the normal Star Wars formula which has led to a lot of hate from many fans. The best of the film includes exploring of the ethos of the force while further developing the characters\\, especially Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke.","true":true}
