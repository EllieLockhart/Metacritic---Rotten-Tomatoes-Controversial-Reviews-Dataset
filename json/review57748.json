Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. For the CRITICS thanks for misleading everybody and giving it a 91 on tomatoes. Obviously none of you thought about all the plot holes in this movie. Maybe you should go back and watch the original trigillogy and the force awakens and then go back and watch the last Jedi because it's not rocket science to see the plot holes and character flaws in this movie. I'm a diehard star wars fan and Disney completely ruined this movie. The director should be ashamed of himself. They completely made Luke look evil and like a complete loser on the island the whole time. I was really looking forward to the meeting between Luke and Rey at the end of the force awakens when she hands him the light saber only for Luke to toss it. Also when Luke tried to kill Kylo when trying to create a new Jedi order is a complete disgrace. I guess Disney and the director haven't seen the original trigillogy at all because THATS NOT LUKE SKYWALKER AT ALL. Thanks Disney for destroying him. Also\\, I guess you don't have to work hard to be a jedi or to use the force. For Rey it just comes naturally in 10 minutes with little to no training at all I guess. And Leia after being the only survivor when the command tower is blown up is able to be conscious use the force to find her way back only to lose conscious for half of the movie is a complete joke. Thanks Disney and this director for messing up the plot and characters. ","true":true}
