Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is definitely not a perfect film\\, but I can honestly say it was good.  It features some of the most breathtaking images in Star Wars history\\, but side plots and occasional ridiculous moments bog down the film toward the middle and end of the film. The biggest detriment to the narrative is its humor. Often\\, it feels disconnected from the drama and leaves much to be desired. Overall\\, it is still an enjoyable film.","true":true}
