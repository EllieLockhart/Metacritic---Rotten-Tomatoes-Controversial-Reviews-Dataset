Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible. The writing itself is deplorable\\, I cannot believe the amount of idiocy that was put into this movie. (Minor Spoilers)\\nGravity in space?\\nFinn was reduced to a throwaway character.\\nRose was born a throwaway character.\\nPoe (who actually made the best leadership decisions was portrayed in a bad light)\\nVice Admiral Amilyn Holdo who made the worst decisions and was a a bad leader was given an undeserved self sacrifice. (It should have gone to Leia or Admiral Ackbar)\\nLiea (Superman) was corrupted by this movie and its plot devies.\\nLuke (F*** You Disney & F*** Ryan Johnson) The redeemer of the biggest villain in all of Star Wars for no explanation other than that he felt darkness in him tried to kill his nephew (the son of his beloved twin sister) Really?\\nKylo Ren is still an angsty teen in disguise. Seriously he is not intimidating at all.\\nRey is still a boring Mary Sue. \\nThe Casino Planet was a stupid waste of time. (BTW\\, why not save the orphan slaves too?)\\nPlease Keep Ryan Johnson away from future franchises\\, you can pay critics but you can't pay everyone else.","true":true}
