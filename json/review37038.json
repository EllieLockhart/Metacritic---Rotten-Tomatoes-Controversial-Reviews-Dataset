Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The music kicked in and the words began to scroll across the screen and I was transported back to childhood and the original movies. I felt the beginning was a bit rough but I was pulled back in and immersed pretty quickly after that. There were ups and downs throughout\\, but overall I had the best time. Daisy Ridley is phenomenal and Carrie \\nFischer gave us an exhausted but hopeful Leia strong\\, realistic\\, patient\\, and fierce. There were moments of beauty\\, awe\\, and joy. Not perfect\\, but strong\\, fun\\, and hopeful. I didn't want it to end. I cannot wait for the next episodes.","true":true}
