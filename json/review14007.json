Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you just want to play in the Star Wars universe and don't really care about who characters were and now are\\, I expect you'll like this movie. It's shiny\\, full of action\\, and there are lightsabers.\\n\\nIf you do care about things like plot\\, logic\\, things making sense\\, characters acting as they would have based on several movies of data\\, having scenes in the movie due to the plot instead of torturing the plot to include a scene(s)-this is not the movie for you. I fall in the latter category. \\n\\nIt's about what I expected\\, but not what I hoped.\\n\\nMilk. That's your only spoiler in this review.","true":true}
