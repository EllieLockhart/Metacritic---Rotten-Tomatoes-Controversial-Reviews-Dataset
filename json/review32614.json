Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, is an excellent movie. It took a lot of the tropes and plot points from the Original Trilogy and flipped it on its head. The CGI in the movie was very well done\\, many explosions\\, very intense moments\\, and a nice side-story with Finn and his new partner. I would have preferred more lightsaber battles though. Overall\\, it was a five-star movie\\, and maybe even better than its predecessor\\, The Force Awakens.","true":true}
