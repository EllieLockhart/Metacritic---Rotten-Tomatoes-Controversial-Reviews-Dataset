Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was long and a great reflection of the state of cinematic propaganda in the current year.  Every member of the cast was engineered to fit modern-day feminist stereotypes.  If your character was a white male\\, well\\, he was either a coward\\, an obstinate blowhard or pathetic in some other way.  The lesson I gleaned was that they were definitely undependable.  If you were a male but not white\\, well you were still inept and underhanded for the most part.  The strong female roles were shining examples of empowered female leadership.  If by shining examples\\, you mean that you cannot get your underlings to follow your orders\\, you're unable to inspire enough confidence in the mission to dissuade open mutiny and your every decision leads the resistance further and further away from any chance of a happy ending.  The major plot-line of the movie had so many holes that the movie would only get 2-3 stars despite the good acting.  I only took half a star away due to the feminist propaganda.","true":true}
