Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a shameless remake of A New Hope. \\n\\nRogue One was A New Hope: The Opening Crawl.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is Empire Strikes Back: The Opening Crawl.\\n\\nThe Rebels evacuate their base after destroying the death star. They seek refuge on a remote icy planet. Where they are attacked by giant armored transports forcing them to flee again.\\n\\nI'm genuinely excited to see Episode 9: The Return of the Ewoks.","true":true}
