Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It didnt work for me\\, i dont understand the fight here for half a star and 5 star\\, u people are all the same\\, u realize that putting 5 star means its a masterpiece a perfect movie. Be honest people and stop playing a war on this site. I didnt like the movie\\, but i gave it 2.5 not half a star. I read people saying that it had flaw but still gave it 5 stars just ti pump the % same can be said for half star. ","true":true}
