Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The only thing this game achieved is making me create an account here.\rThe story(so literally the whole point of single player game) is trash. I don't know who approved it and I know I'll be attacked by soyboys and SJWs\\, but this is what reviews are for.\rDevs leaked ENTIRE STORY months before release. Most fans didn't like it\\, what do devs do? Fix it? Take advice from people that are actually gonna play the game? Nope\\, blame it on homophobia and release it as it is and hope for idiots to buy a bad game because it has homosexual and trans characters in it which is pretty ironic because people who scream the most about it are the most responsible for it. No\\, we do not care that Ellie is a lesbian. No\\, we do not care that a dude decided that he feels like a woman. We care about the story and the story here was sacrificed to make a \\\"look here's the story of a lesbian and a pregnant jewish lesbian and then trans woman who isn't killed by angry lesbian because plot armor and then stuff happens\\\".\rTo this point I thought that new trilogy of SW was bad. Congratulations you're now #1 in bad storytelling.\r\rTho Ellie's VA was a good choice. Too bad she had a bad script xD\u2026 Expand","true":true}
