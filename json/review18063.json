Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think TLJ is the most interesting of the new trilogy because it begins to move the story forward again and it does some things no Star Wars film has done before. Instead of the juvenile good\/bad duality we get shades of gray. Characters make mistakes. It\u2019s a very human Star Wars film. I liked it.","true":true}
