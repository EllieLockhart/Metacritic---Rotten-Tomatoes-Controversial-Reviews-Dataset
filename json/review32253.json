Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi - Review (2017)\\n\\nThe Good\\nWell first Thank God the Open Crawl Text is back THANK GOD and the film opens with a bang with Space Battles!\\n\\nRian Johnson's Direction is Phenomenal and is risky and takes chances cause Lucasfilm  gave him freedom and it shows\\n\\nDaisy Ridley as Rey isn't the strongest performer in the cast\\, but she's easily likeable as Rey\\, and once again does a great job of conveying her sense of confusion and longing about wanting to know who she is and where she belongs\\, with plenty of charm\\, conflict\\, and when required\\, badassery.\\n\\nEven better is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. He's already established himself as an actor of supreme talent\\, and his gifts are on full display here. There's a burning intensity to most of his scenes\\, and he really gets to the complexities of his character. He's torn\\, angry\\, hurt\\, scared\\, and immensely powerful\\, and all that comes through in a fascinating\\, layered performance from Driver. He's an imposing figure with a face you never want to look away from\\, capable of commanding the screen with just an expression\\, and he further establishes Kylo as a great Star Wars villain.\\n\\nBut When their together its like Magic on Screen and leads to the Most Badass scene in the movie.\\n\\nMark Hammil as Luke Skywalker - This is the Best Performance Hamill has ever done as Luke\\, and people are getting are bitching oh Luke wouldn't do this or that\\, well if you look at the Prequels with Yoda he was a wise Teacher in Revenge of the Sith he lost all the Jedi and went into hiding and became a different person same with Luke\\, and I was very much satisfied with his arc in this movie.\\n\\nCarrie Fisher as General Leia Organa is fantastic as well this is the best performance Carrie Fisher has done as Leia and you will feel emotional when you see her on screen.\\n\\nOscar Isaac as Poe Dameron is once again great and has a fantastic and underated Arc that I really enjoyed\\n\\nPuppet sorta someone that is all  what I will say\\n\\nDomhnall Gleeson as General Hux is great\\n\\nThis film has the Best Lightsaber Battle in any Star Wars Film that involves Rey and Kylo and its Fucking awesome.\\n\\nRian Johnson does something new with the Force Mythology and some people are gonna hate it\\, but I loved it cause it deepens the levels of the Jedi.\\n\\nChewbacca and The PORGS\\n\\nSeeing R2-D2 and C-3PO\\n\\nLaura Dern\u00c2\u00a0as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo I thought was good\\n\\nBuilding The Resistance\/First Order Conflict\\n\\nThe Visual Effects are fantastic especially on Snoke its crazy how real he looks and he is played amazing by Andy Serkis\\n\\nThe Editing and Wideshots are some of the best\\n\\nJohn Williams score is fantastic again \\n\\nGreat and Not Forced Call Backs and has some call backs to Empire\\, but this is not a reshash this is more original than The Force Awakens this takes chances and risk and surprises that I loved and it moves the Franchise forward and as Kylo says \\\"Let the Past Died\\\"\\n\\nThe Bad \\nThe Finn and Rose arc is not that interesting\\, Jon Boyega as Finn is still great and Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico is a great and sweet new addition to the series\\, but their arc is really pointless when their adventure ends and their Arc kinda drag the movies pace a little.\\n\\nBenicio del Toro as DJ did not work\\n\\nOverall: I Love this film (Fuck those Trolls)\\, this was a beautiful made film\\, I can't wait see what JJ Abrams does in Episode IX in 2019\\n\\nOverall Grade: A","true":true}
