Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi was far from expectations in terms of where we all thought the story might go. It feels like a star wars movie but in a refreshing way it also doesn't. Certain story arches in this movie are less interesting (Finn and Rose) and every once in a while the humor feels like too much. Other than those two complaints this movie is excellent and will keep you on the edge of your seat.","true":true}
