Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Same mediocre gameplay\\, it's not even different enough to call it adjusted\\, added too a little sure but it's still sameish enough that you can't say it's better.

The so called \\\"opening up\\\" of the game was for one area in the early game after that it's the exact same corridor gameplay as the last game only much much more of it\\, so much that it slows the feel of progression down dramatically\\, accentuated by the fact you don't want to be playing it after the first 15 minutes and then a new heavy wave of exhaustion hits at about the half way mark (around 15 hours). If they had kept to the open area idea they did in the start of this game it might have been different enough\\, but they choose not to.\r\rVisual design and acting are the only things keeping this game afloat from a 0 imo\\, and normally i could give this game a 7 or 8 out of 10 if the direction of the story wasn't so horrendously bad. There are so many better ways Druckmann could have rearranged the telling of this story so that people didn't outright HATE one of the characters. There are so many ways the story telling of this game could have been written to enjoy it better\\, maybe not entirely because the most overwhelming feeling that seems oddly designed make you hate the characters you play. Granted a unique but un-enjoyable way to play a video game.\r\rWhat was clear from the beginning; a story of love\\, vengence and Jewish history. I mean\\, there is SO much of the overtones and in your face Israeli-Palestine conflict and Jewish culture in this game I began to think it wasn't even about the main characters. It became just a bloody message of awareness to the middle eastern conflicts. I feel for the people lost in conflict and for those who feel so much hate in this world\\, and I enjoy a deep soul discovering story as much as the next person but forcing you to play as a character you hate is such a horrible way to experience a story much less to PLAY A GAME.\r\rThe writing for this game is on par with what i expect Naughty Dog to do\\, it does have a really good voice but I feel for the employees at Naughty Dog and the cast of this game\\, they did an amazing job and it's not their fault the direction of the game was so poorly designed\\, Niel Druckmann was just not reigned in by Bruce Straley this time. Clearly all the people leaving early in this games development were people that could not willingly fulfill the direction of this game either.\r\rTo Neil: It's your right to make the story what you want\\, it's not my right to say you shouldn't but you failed at providing an entertaining game\\, it's that simple.\r\rTo readers: if you really wont resolution to the Joel and Ellie story wait for this game to go on sale\\, it doesn't deserve the praise from critics or price it has.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
