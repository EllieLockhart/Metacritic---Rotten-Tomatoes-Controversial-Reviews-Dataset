We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Spoilers ahead.\r\rSo\\, in this game you're forced to sympathize and empathize with a new character\\, Abby\\, which father you killed in the first game as Joel. The doctor was the only (...) doctor who were able to safe the world (...).\rJoel dies in the first ~ 2 hours of the game\\, which i'm fine with. I'm also fine with how he dies.\rBut i'm not fine with playing for 10 - 15 hours with this annoying new super hulk character (Abby)\\, in which i have zero interest in. Neither do i have any interest in any of their friends.\r\rI wanted do enjoy and play the game as Ellie\\, but nope. Play as Abby and feel what she feels. There were not a second i gave a **** about her.\r\rThe most annoying thing is the end of the game:\rYou\\, as Ellie\\, have a fist fight against Abby. On the way finding Abby you killed hundred of people\\, just to get her location and get your revenge. Then\\, you finally reached your goal and find Abby\\, you're fighting her and you're about to drown her\\, but then\\, you stop. Because revenge is bad and you feel bad if you kill her.\rWTF.\rAnyway: Plot holes and bad writing everywhere. Glad i got the game physically and can sell it again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
