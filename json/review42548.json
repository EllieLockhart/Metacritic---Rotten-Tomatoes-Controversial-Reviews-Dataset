Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an SJW horrorshow. Messy dialogue\\, useless character shoehorned in (along with the occasional phenomenally useless love interest\\, sidelining of previously popular characters like Po and Finn who were treated as if they were more tertiary characters in favor of introducing or empowering far weaker characters who honestly seemed to have less to lose in the rebellion such as the purple-haired one and the ethnically-Asian one\\, and obnoxious 'go-green' propaganda).\\nAlso\\, don't forget the destruction of Luke Skywalker's character and the way he died for no reason after fighting something in an incredibly stupid way (he would never have risked his life in the past just for the sake of being flashy\\, he was the opposite and it's a shame the movie makers didn't understand this basic character that everyone should know in this franchise). Kylo got too much screentime as a whiny baby character\\, Rey became completely useless and just asked people for salvation the whole movie\\, everything about previous films was ignored or marginalized\\, other than some nice graphics it was a waste of my time\\, as a fan I will most likely just go re-read the Thrawn Trilogy\\, as it is the last good example of the Star Wars Universe's potential.\\n\\nThe film also was intentional destruction of male legacy\\, storylines and characters from previous movies that this move claims to be a part of. If it wasn't for the 'Star Wars' logo slapped on the front\\, this movie could have easily been any other one. For example\\, a muppet movie\\, the Rocky Horror Picture version of Star Wars (it will probably be popular one day ironically)\\, or Taledega Nights. In my mind it was nothing but a dry rot in the crown of Star Wars\\, I'm very much looking forward to saving my money when the next few films come out. I would rather watch the original trilogy fourteen times in a row than a new movie made under the same name but produced like this. Even the plot and storyline in this movie was episodic\\, possibly useful for a children's cartoon tv series\\, but not good enough for the silver screen. Standards should be higher than this. What a mess.","true":true}
