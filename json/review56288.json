{"101487":170405,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-31","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was... odd. It was a good movie don't get me wrong\\, but it was filled with plot holes and moral gymnastics. For example\\, Princess Leia magically has the ability to use the force\\, even though she has never previously shown that power\\, the hacker that Finn & co. go to find is unreachable but even though he is\\, and I quote \\\"the only one in the galaxy who can get you through\\\" they still find a criminal hacker completely by luck because reasons. I like the backstory of Luke's mistake over Kylo Ren\\, though when the actual entire truth is revealed it no longer makes sense why Kylo murdered some of Luke's students and took the rest to the Sith rather than\\, oh I don't know\\, killing Luke and contacting his parents to tell him his uncle just tried to murder him. Oh and Rey is still a Mary Sue\\, a bit less than it the Force Awakens though thankfully. Back onto Kylo\\, he states that his true goal is to end both the Jedi and the Sith\\, the First Order and the Rebellion and end the battle between light and evil so Disney don't have to make any more F*cking movies\\, but as soon as he gets the chance to crush the First Order he just joins them to destroy the Rebellion. Oh and Luke dies from non existent wounds because Mark Hamill's had enough of this sh*t. My biggest jab at SW:TLJ  is that it doesn't do what the 2nd movie in the original trilogy does\\, leave a powerful empire over a handful of characters with many emotionally defeated so that the final movie can resolve everything\\, overcome and crush the empire and make the lead Sith turn good. But this Trilogy could've been concluded in this movie\\, Kylo had his character development and could've of finished both the F.O and the Rebellion and ended the series right there. Instead we're left with a crushed F.O\\, a small but strong Rebellion and a Rey that is 100% stronger than Kylo Ren.","true":true}
