Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so bad i just can't honestly believe it got the go ahead\\, \\nSo luke skywalker gave up the force and is dissalusioned he is now bitter and cynical\\, \\nRei has 1 60 second lesson to become a jedi?. snoke ? who is\/was he ?. A stupid slow motion space chase that makes no \\nsense\\, its actually worse than speed 2 on the boat\\,\\nLeia floating in space like mary poppins \\nLuke uses a holographic projection to stall the first order then it drains him so much dies LMFAO. \\nRepeatedly they keep saying forget the past (movies) and start a new\\,\\nwell unfortunately there are 40 years and 8 movies you just can't forget\\, however this is one movie i would love to forget.","true":true}
