Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is splitting fans right down the middle\\, I for one am on the light side. I loved this movie\\, in my opinion the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi (I will always consider the original trilogy as the best movies). Mark Hamill is at his best\\, and the same goes for Carrie Fisher. This movie takes a lot of chances and certainly has a flaw or two\\, but I really thought this was an exciting movie that kept me surprised.","true":true}
