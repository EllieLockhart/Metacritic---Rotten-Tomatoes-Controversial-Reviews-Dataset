Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is better than i expected.\\nMaybe  a little problems shows\\, but there is so many precision and care about the little stories and puts weight on my shoulder. Make difficult Decisions to the Characters and to the viewers as well. The last 1 hour is like..wow there is 2 or 3 Finales there\\, what happened??? That Was amazing.SW8 shows the new and the future for us. I hope there is some better future to all Movies.\\nPeople gave too low audience score to the movie for no reason..\\nMy value is 4.5\/5\\, but i give more +0.5 FOR NO REASON","true":true}
