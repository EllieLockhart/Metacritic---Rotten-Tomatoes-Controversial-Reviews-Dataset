Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever. None of the new story lines and characters introduced in TFA and in the Aftermath books were used effectively. Rian Johnson flicked old characters off his finger like a booger he was trying to get rid of. Stupid plot holes. Leia somehow transformed into Superwoman. Apparently Chewbacca is now a vegan because the movie needed two minutes of screen time to deal with his moral dilemma over self-sustinance ... couldn't give that much time to Snoke's backstory though. Glad Rose (completely new and totally boring character was part of half of the movie\\, because when you have Luke Freaking Skywalker to work with\\, let's choose random new character as the focus of the movie. I mean\\, Rey is just somehow a superhuman Jedi after like ZERO training. And pretty much the entire rebel fleet was decimated so this was basically a snuff film for all hope. Can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am in this movie.","true":true}
