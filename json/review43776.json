Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars movie ever. The story and each character were so poorly written.  First Star Wars movie I was ever bored at. Had tickets to see it again on New Year's Eve but I am going to try to get a refund. Rian Johnson killed Star Wars.","true":true}
