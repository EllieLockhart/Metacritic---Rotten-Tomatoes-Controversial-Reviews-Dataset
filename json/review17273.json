Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like it. It makes all the time I spent watching the previous movies\\, the clone wars\\, and Rebels\\, really feel aimless and a waste of time for Luke to kind of be a chump in the end. I actively had to re-immerse myself several times into the movie as so many moments forced me out of watching and enjoying to say \\\"huh?\\\"","true":true}
