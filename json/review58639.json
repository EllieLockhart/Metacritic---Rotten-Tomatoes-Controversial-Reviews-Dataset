Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I dont want to give this game 0\/10\\, but due to critics overrating the game\\, I think it should be a message for developers. Game is trying to make you feel compassion for whole Abby storyline. Its a great idea to show two sides of coin. Idea is great\\, but the way they did it really confuses me. I forced myself to play  Abby part for this 10 hour. I let her be eaten by clickers around 80 times. If there was a way to kill her\\, i did it. I wish the scenario worked for me\\, but it didnt. I guess it is an evidence of the fact that game is poorly written. When game made me play Abby against Ellie\\, I simply didnt want to punch Ellie. How can i worry more about a boring grey character like abby more than Joel and Ellie who were main chracters in first game. TLOU2 had a great potential\\, but they screwed up. I dont knwo who to blame for this. I didnt raise the topic of absolute uninteresting new characters (Mel\\, Nora\\, Abby\\, Owen and other part og their wolf gang). Abundance of pregnancy ( zebra is pregnant - abby's father is good because he saved it\\, Ellie killed dozens of people\\, but when she kills Mel who is PREGNANT she gets shocked. Dina is pregnant and that affects Abby's choice. Third point\\, I dont have anything against LGBTQ and women overall but why mostly all women characters are shown form a good perspective (Abby is a good person at last\\, Leader of scars is good at last\\, leader of Jackson Marie is right about revenge etc) while male are shown from a bad side ( Joel is a selfish moron\\, Tommy cant leave the idea of revenge\\, leader of Wolves is a coldblood child killer). Fourth point is straight up lying in trailers ( shwoing that joel is alive and that they will have adventues in seattle).  I put 0\/10\\, because i think this game is overrated. As a fan of first part i fell like Nill just spitted in my face.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
