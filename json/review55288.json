Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leia's scene in space definitely ranks among one of the top worst scenes of the saga. The cuteness of creatures was kind of expected as marketing drives that spect (does not entirely ruin the story); however\\, Rey -male's name- and Kylo's multiple telepathy sessions is not suitable to the story\\, especially when King (Rey) is not even a padawan yet. Luke's comeback leaves emptiness to the entire saga. Not a fair expected comeback with an unfounded hologram-supported battle with brat-looking rather than bad-looking Kylo.","true":true}
