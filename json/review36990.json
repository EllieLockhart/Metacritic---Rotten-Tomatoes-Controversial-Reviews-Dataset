Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was slow\\, and was not engaging. Felt like the writer\/director didn\u2019t know how to proceed with the film and made things up along the way. This is the worst Star Wars movie of the franchise. Felt as if he just wanted to throw away the characters. His idea seemed to care more for his new characters\\, and forget about the characters from past movies. It appears the writer did not have any affection towards characters previously established\\, as he just washed them away","true":true}
