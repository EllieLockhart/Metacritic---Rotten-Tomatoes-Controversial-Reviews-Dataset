Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Melhor filme depois da trilogia original. As pessoas talvez n\u00e3o entendem que o filme mostra uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o. Que o novo sempre vem que o passado \u00e9 algo importante mas tem que ficar para tr\u00e1s. A vida tem que seguir. E a for\u00e7a \u00e9 muito maior e complicada do que podemos entender. O filme surpreende \u00e9 inovador e mostra porque Kylo Ren e a Rey s\u00e3o os protagonistas e antagonistas perfeitos para o futuro. E tem muita filosofia profunda.","true":false}
