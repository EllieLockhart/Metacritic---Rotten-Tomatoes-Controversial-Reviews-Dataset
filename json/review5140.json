Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Daisy Ridley (Ray)  and Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) turned an otherwise failed Star Wars movie into a better than average film. Daisy's acting in particular was top notch and her scenes felt like they were the only ones with true suspense. All of the other side plots were directionless and unnecessarily time consuming. It seems the director and writers tried their best to make this film a disaster with Fin and Rose's story line\\, the pungently bad purple haired captain and an unbelievabley incompetent First Order fleet.","true":true}
