Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does Rian Johnson even have JJ Abrams' phone number?  Apparently not because the @&$&$ movie has zero connection to The Force Awakens. Rian has managed to make me hate a franchise I've loved all my life. Just like Indian Jones 4\\, this goes into my small bucket of movies I pretend don't exist","true":true}
