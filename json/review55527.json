Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals\\, shit story. Also takes a huge dump on the universe that fans cared about.. \\nQuestions unanswered or total cop out(Snoke\\, Rey's parents).\\nNew characters never developed.. Story lacks universal values (no need to learn anything\\, no need to struggle or work hard\\, even if you fail your mission you can luck out and find someone else to do the job..no consequences)\\nOld characters disrespected.. Not consistent with their actions in previous movies.. Seriously Luke didn't give up on the most evil characters ever but gave up on his nephew?\\nDon't think Disney understands what ppl love about star wars..","true":true}
