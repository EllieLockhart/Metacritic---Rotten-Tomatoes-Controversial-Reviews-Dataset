Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so forgettable.\\nThere's not much to say. People hate it and some people love it.\\nYoda does something that destroys information that could help others but his explanation is that Rey already knows. Luke's character is debatably destroyed.\\nThe message of this movie is to destroy the past.","true":true}
