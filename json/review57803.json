Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Want to know why the \\\"critics\\\" love it and the audience hates it?\\n\\nIts because the critics are payed to \\\"love it\\\" and the audience is honest.\\n\\nAny actual \\\"fans\\\" of StarWars will hate this plot-hole filled\\, SJW cash-grab\\nthat spits in the face of the previous movies.\\n\\nThis is yet another franchise I loved that has been sold out. Yet the true\\nproblem is all the shills and sheep that clap when the credits roll.","true":true}
