Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Practically the only amusing part of the movie was the crash at light speed. There was an hour to hour and a half of filler that didn't need to be there\\, marketed to SJW's\\, and the romance  had no reason to be there (other than filler). Watch the original trilogy\\, Disney needs to stop ruining Star Wars and leave it be.","true":true}
