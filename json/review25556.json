Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No strong male figure throughout the entire movie. While it was great to see some strong female characters\\, it just seemed as though there was too much agenda throughout the movie. Reverse racism\\, sexism\\, and anti-religion. The action on the other hand was great\\, lots of filler to get through in order to enjoy it. Disney sold out a long time ago before they were in a galaxy far far away.","true":true}
