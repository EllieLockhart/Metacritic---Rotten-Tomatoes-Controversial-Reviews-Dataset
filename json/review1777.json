Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, this has to be one of the most disappointing films. The whole thing is just bad writing\\, too many plot wholes\\, and a whole subplot that was felt unnecessary. It was enjoyable and there were scenes that were beautiful\\, but it did not justify the way the story was told. There were many parts of the film that seemed\\, far-fetched to happen and parts of the film were I was unpleasantly shocked\\, WTF moment because I just don't see it actually happening. It gave me more questions than answers\\, and not in a good way..","true":true}
