{"101487":113965,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**CONTAINS FUCKING SPOILERS!**\\nLet me tell right here\\, and right now I am done with the Star Wars franchise. Not only is the main protagonist a dumb broad who has A cups for titties\\, she also is about as intelligent as my right testicle. Speaking of testicles I cringed so hard at the part where Yoda pulled out his cock and started to slice away at it with his light saber. Like\\, really? You're going to show a scene a male show his dick\\, but no female boobies\\, what a fucking disgrace! The dick scene is definitely going to please the SJWS.\\nSpeaking of Social Justice Warriors\\, the lady who takes over the resistance fleet after Leia dies in a orgy with Han Solo and Luke Skywalker(Solo and Luke die in that orgy too)\\, is a disgusting purple haired feminist! This disgusting being\\, who is a feminist\\, takes a page out of the book of the most oppressive religion to women\\, Islam\\, and chooses it as her favorite religion. We know this because near the end of the film she Allhu Akbars the First Orders ship in the name of Islam. I don't know what was more repulsive\\, the movie theater hot dog I ordered that tasted good\\, but was given to me by a disabled person\\, or the fact that allowed females to have a main role in the film (I.E. being a light saber person thingy\\, leading an army\\, flying a space ship). I mean this movie is so in accurate it has women fucking driving\/piloting heavy machinery that moves! I mean I've never a woman successfully drive a car with out killing someone else while she's texting and driving\\, so how the fuck do you expect her to fly a space ship across a battle field. \\nI along with these roles being fucked I am also very disappointed in the casting of Daisy Riddley as Rey (and in the way they wrote her character). Not only is Daisy's forehead about the size of my foot (I wear a size 13 in mens fyi)\\, but they write Rey and Fin as two star crossed lovers. Now let me tell you why this doesn't work. Rey is a white girl\\, Fin is a black guy\\, black guys aren't human they are part apes\\, therefore this relationship is a disgusting display of bestiality and coal burning. The last thing that doesn't make sense about their relationship is that Rey is skinny\\, and if black guys do date white girls they like them big and fat\\, so.","true":true}
