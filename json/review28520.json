Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probabaly the best since Empire. Has one of the most visually stunning scenes in the entire series. The acting is top notch and better than 75$ of the rest of the series. Highy recommended.","true":true}
