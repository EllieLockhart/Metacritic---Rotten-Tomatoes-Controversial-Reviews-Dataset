Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First you should see the movie and form your own opinion\\, however in my opinion this movie is bad. There are to many plot holes\\, the slapstick comedy\\, and the forced attempts at humor were all bad. The portrayal of Luke Skywalker was what officially killed this movie for me. It was a slap in the face to all the fans. I wish that The director had listened to Mr. Hamill and had done this the right way. ","true":true}
