{"101487":161310,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, I am on the fence as a fan. \\n\\nRather than a typical review\\, I'm going to go through this in sections and pull up some of the major points that grabbed my attention. \\n\\nThe acting\\, music score\\, visuals of the movie\\, costume DESIGN\\, fight scenes and camera work were all amazing.. Can't fault those things at all.\\n\\nHowever\\, The pacing felt off\\, it was a lot to take in\\, needs smoothing out a bit. \\n\\nGoing into the lore and continuation of the SW mythos  in this movie...  powers\\, visions. I'm good with it. I don't have the complaints that some fans have about the Force in this film. I don't mind new takes on the Force. The Expanded universe did that all the time as did the ORIGINAL movies.\\n\\nI am unhappy with however\\, as most people are\\, is the fact rey can do all of these amazing feats with the force in a matter of hours or days without having any training\\, which goes against the entire premise of the previous films that to get anywhere to become a jedi or force user one had to work hard for it. Rey however seems to be able to do anything she wants with little EFFORT and I found that off putting. As much as I defended the character in the first movie\\, I could not do so for this movie. The only way they could really fix such a thing is to state that she \\\"was\\\" trained already\\, a former jedi or alike\\, but lost her memories\\, however that might be a bit hard to explain now with what was set up and stated about rey in this movie\\, a missed OPPORTUNITY I felt.\\n\\nPlot points and story telling...\\n\\nThere were some interesting things but also a great many things I had issues with\\, these things all fall into issues with CONTINUITY\\, both for star wars as a whole and this new TRILOGY. \\n\\nSnoke's death... very... oddly placed\\, unexpected. But... I just have a feeling he's not dead\\, there is just something up with that. His character was too built up and then abruptly ended.He was shown to be very powerful\\, yet not back story\\, despite the movie implying that he was important. I'm hoping this is expanded upon in SW 9.\\n\\nAs for Leia's space flying scene\\, I personally loved. It was great seeing her use the Force that way\\, unexpected\\, thought she was going to die in that moment. It makes sense that she could use the Force in some way like that. Though some fans dislike it\\, I am not one of them. (Though others do make a good point about her getting back inside the ship was odd due to the VACUUM of space).\\n\\nA small issue I had was Luke hiding away\\, and there being a map to him. I find that odd that he seemed to have left a trail if he wanted to stay hidden..Though I can accept the explanation that the map was to the Jedi temple\\, as opposed to Luke himself\\, or something that he left behind.\\n\\n\\nLuke's death was interesting even though some dislike it. \\n\\nI'm very split on his personality however. I accept that people do change over the years\\, though I also agree that it's odd that a man who wanted to save his father\\, who was already considered a monster\\, would want to kill Ben for turning to the Darkside\\, to prevent his actions\\,rather than save him. He ran away from guilt and to \\\"die\\\"\\, so I would think that.. as a hero\\, if he wanted to die\\, then why not die in a last ditch attempt in killing Snoke? But instead he became a hermit. Luke is not perfect\\, and nor do I expect him to be\\, but I'm unsure if this change in him is a bit \\\"too\\\" far a stretch\\, But again I can appreciate this different take on Luke too. I respect the vision of this movie. So I'm very split\\n\\nI wanted to see more of Luke's explanations of why the Jedi had to end. Rather than just \\\"the Jedi are arrogant\\\". And then that opinion being changed... for no clear reason other than \\\"please come back we need you\\, it's not your fault\\\". I think it would have been better to have him say \\\"the Jedi were the first to use the Force\\, and we gave birth to the Sith\\, Dark Jedi\\, Vader... Kylo Ren\\\" and then have him want to end \\\"all\\\" of it. That the Jedi are a danger to the galaxy or something because people always fall to the darkside eventually and hurt the galaxy. And then have him convinced that without the Jedi\\, darkside cults will always rise.Which sparks his return. But that's just my version.\\n\\nI like the Yoda scene. I think it was clever that Yoda burned down the tree\\, to show Luke the truth in his heart\\, that he really did not want the Jedi to end\\, or he would have done that a long time ago. \\n\\nSome scenes were pointless and dragged\\, like the Finn & Rose side story with DJ. Their end romance felt forced and not earned. As much as I love Finn\\, I feel his sacrifice would have been an a emotional and worth while moment to have\\, rather than Rose stopping him. It was a bit inconsistent to have her tell Finn to not die for the people you love.. by almost killing herself to save the one she loved. I don't know what message that was supposed to impart.\\n\\n\\nOther than that... some scenes had some.. \\\"forced comedy\\\"\\, out of character moments for some individuals during serious moments. But overall\\, enjoyable if you just want cool action scenes and visuals. \\n\\nI'd still like to find out who Rey is\\, her parents and so on\\, it's hidden and I think Kylo is lying to her. I'm sure (I hope). I'm counting on that SW 9 can patch up some things and that this movie is leaving some mysteries and uncertainties on purpose.. (JJ has a lot of work ahead of him though to try and SALVAGE this)\\n\\nI really hope this to be the case\\, as if not\\, as I mentioned earlier\\, rey is far too overpowered for someone who has had no training. and that really spits on the essence of the previous movies  and the core morals and PRINCIPLES they taught\\, to work hard to achieve something\\, to be patient\\, that things wont come to you on a plate. The story of rey so far would appear to throw all of that into the bin and for no good or logical reason at all. Any attempt to explain her major power and skills goes against the already pre-established mythos from the previous films and expanded universe.  I'm hoping they can fix this.\\n\\nI respect Rian's vision in that he wanted a very different SW movie. I'd give it a 2 star rating (2.5 to be GENEROUS of me) I feel. Very new and fresh\\, yet also some odd changes that may go a bit too 180 on some characters. Though I understand that it was intentional. \\n\\nMy side notes and nitpicks is that we do not see the New Republic in this movie (just like in TFA)\\, I dislike the Rebels vs Empire story being repeated and I feel it does not pay respect to Return of the Jedi\\, in that seeing the NR in action and in power should of been the big payoff from the OT. Rather than this NR\\, Resistance and First Order strange trio relationship going on\\, leading back to where the OT started\\, and that to me just feels a bit lazy. But that is just a personal vision\\, not to do with the quality of movie making\\, but as a lore fan.","true":true}
