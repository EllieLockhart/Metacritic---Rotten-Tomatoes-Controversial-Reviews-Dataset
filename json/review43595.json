Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not a terrible movie but it most definitely was not a great movie either. At the end I didn't feel like the last 2 and a half hours were well spent. I don't mind comedy but it seemed forced into the script. The storyline wasn't cohesive\\, Adam Driver's acting still reminds me of a ma petulant teenagers behavior. Hux's lisp\/accent was infuriating as was much of the dialogue in this movie. The battles were ok but just ok. Rey was the highlight of this movie\\, it's hard to argue that she's the one thing that kept this movie afloat. You could wait for this to be released on video and save yourself the bother of having to go see it in a theatre. As a life long Star Wars fan I was not impressed.","true":true}
