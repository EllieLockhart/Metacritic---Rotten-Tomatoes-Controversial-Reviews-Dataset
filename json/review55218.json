Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a very dark moment in the history of Star Wars. Never felt that sad about the Star Wars universe ever before. Disney should have sticked to JJ Abrams. He delivered a superb Episode 7. Rian Johnson shoudl feel deeply ashamed of what he had done to my childhood hero and all the millions of fans out there.","true":true}
