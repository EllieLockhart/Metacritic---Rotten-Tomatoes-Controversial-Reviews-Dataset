Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a life long\\, die-hard Star Wars fan  who grew up in the '70s and '80s loving nothing more than Star Wars. Last Jedi  was the best Star Wars movie to date. I never thought I'd like anything more than Empire\\, but this one did it. I've read all the books\\, the comics\\, I love this movie. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting\\, but it was awesome!  *Thematic spoiler* it has a fresh take on that middle movie tragedy like Empire where all is apparently lost and i can't wait to see where it goes from here!","true":true}
