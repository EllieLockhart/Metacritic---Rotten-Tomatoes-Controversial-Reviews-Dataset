Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This definitely \\\"feels\\\" like a star wars movie.  Well most of the time.  There are a few sequences that remove the \\\"star wars element.\\\"  Rey is still overpowered with no explanation.  Luke is completely different from how he was in the previous movies.  Chalk it up to old age\\, I guess.  The bad guys are not really bad. They are weak\\, pathetic\\, and hardly any threat.  The fight scenes are mostly garbage\\, this is because Disney doesn't know how to handle fight scenes\\, like at all.  Fin is totally pointless as usual.  A new character is introduced\\, Rose.  She is inserted for diversity purposes exclusively\\, and serves absolutely no purpose to the plot.  All in all not worth seeing.","true":true}
