Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am still in shock of how much I do not like this movie and I Love Star Wars. This movie embodies nothing about the characters we all have grown to love from the original trilogy and completely removes the point of many of the characters introduced in The Force Awakens. I really mean I have no idea what the plan for Episode 9 is going to be and sadly I feel I do not really care. This was the same feeling I had when I came out of Rogue One with a lot of characters that really I did not care about doing things on screen for no purpose then the movie ended. I even loved the Prequel trilogy as each movie had a purpose even if many felt the execution was not handled well. The Last Jedi just does not feel like it knew what it was or where it wanted to go. For the first time ever I cannot recommend anyone go see a Star Wars movie. This actually breaks my heart. I give it 2 stars as some of the battle scenes were nice and the look and sound of the movie was done well.","true":true}
