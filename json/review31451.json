Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some parts could have been better. Didn't care a lot for the whole story line with Finn and Rose. Outside of that I loved the character development of Rey and Kylo. Also what they did with Luke was incredible!","true":true}
