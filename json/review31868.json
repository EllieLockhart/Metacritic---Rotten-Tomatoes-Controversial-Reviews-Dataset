Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler alert!\\n\\nKylo Ren's character grows in this movie\\, that's the only character with an arc. The rest are just wandering around in the wilderness.\\n\\nMost of the questions raised in The Force Awakens have been discarded. The mystery around Snoke is resolved by killing him. And he is killed all too easily I must say. I think eliminating him is good for the trilogy\\, but I don't think it was handled well. The battle after his death is visually interesting\\, but emotionally unengaging. There is nothing at stake now that Snoke is dead.\\n\\nWho is Rey? No one? Really!? The character deserves a better treatment. A little effort in the storytelling. If a powerful Jedi can rise from nowhere\\, why are Yoda and Obi Wan so concerned about Luke and Leia being the last. How can Rey learn to use the force without training? This is critical to the plot and simply discarded.\\n\\nAfter such a long leadup to meeting Luke he has zero impact on the story overall\\, except to delay the First Order troops from entering the base. He's just a grumpy hermit on an island filled with pointless creatures. Why spend so much time wandering the island? For cheap laughs.\\n\\nWhat was the code breaker for?\\n\\nI could go on\\, but why?","true":true}
