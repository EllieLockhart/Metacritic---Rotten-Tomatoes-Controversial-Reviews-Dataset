Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful train wreck of a film that completely negates the story set up in it's predecessor. If that's not enough a senseless plot\\, poor characterisation and at times some poor cgi makes this film the biggest let down of the year.","true":true}
