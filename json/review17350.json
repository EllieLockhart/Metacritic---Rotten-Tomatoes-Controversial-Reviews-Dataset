Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw an article before seeing the movie that said that the director of Last Jedi let Carrie Fisher write most of her own lines. After seeing the film I couldn't help but think that maybe he should have let Mark Hamill do the same and then this film might not have been such a freaking disaster","true":true}
