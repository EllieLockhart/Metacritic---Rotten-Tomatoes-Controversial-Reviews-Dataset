Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a typical Star Wars movie. As usual some people will like it\\, some will hate it. I however am kind of in the middle of the road on this film. After trying to stray away from spoilers and finally getting to watch the film\\, I came away a little disappointed after I walked out of the theater. It's not that it was a bad movie\\, not at all\\, it was just not the direction that I thought they would go after TFA. The story and characters are decently developed and leaves you wondering what is planned for the future and what they might do to tie some loose ends with certain characters.\\n\\nMark Hamill was great as Luke once again\\, he brought forward a strong and compelling performance. Daisy Ridley brought along another strong performance as Rey. John Boyega as Fin and Kelly Marie Tran as Rose brought a decent side story with interesting characters\\, but their \\\"romance\\\" seemed forced and not entirely necessary. Carrie Fisher was great to see as Leia once again. However the best performance to me was Adam Driver's as Kylo Ren\\, he brought a great performance that makes the character look very self centered\\, but also very conflicted about his emotions.\\n\\nIn the end\\, to me\\, this is a decent movie but I am very interested to see what's planned for the future.","true":true}
