Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, beautiful movie that was shockingly bad and leaves little reason to care about the characters or the whole franchise in general. I appreciate a movie that takes risks\\, but not one that makes you question why you cared about the movie's universe at all. While it looked beautiful\\, the paper thin characters some how felt even thinner by the end of it. The one exception being Kylo Ren - sorta. His idea of burning the past to escape it is kinda interesting. But you feel zero pathos for him\\, so he too eventually falls flat. \\n\\nWay to ruin it Disney.","true":true}
