Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I AM TIRED OF STUPID ROTTEN TOMATOES NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO AUDIENCE CRITICS! STUPID SITE! OUR VOICES SHALL BE HEARD NOW!!!\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi was really messed up! It has f**ked up Star Wars. Sure\\, The Force Awakens was bad\\, but THIS IS BULLCRAP! LUKE DIES!!\\nStupid Rotten Tomatoes. Now you will find audience critics important now!","true":true}
