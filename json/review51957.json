Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh breath into an old franchise. I've been a huge fan since 1981 and I love just about everything in this movie. What a great fun time at the movies with some wonderful geeky conversation fodder to keep us engaged for years.","true":true}
