But man do I wish I had never laid my hands on this abomination.Now let\u2019s be honest here; The gameplay was ok\\, nothing too special or exquisite tho\\, just a smooth variation of what you\u2019d find in other third person AAA titles.The scenery and graphics and just the General way the game looked was stunning. Generally speaking\\, it is a really\\, reaally well-made game. Which makes me even more mad.Because all of the effort that the developer team put into creating such beautiful environment\/characters\\, went to the bin thanks to the INSANE decisions that were made plot-wise\\, character-wise and marketing-wise.A game like the last of us\\, is all about the story. Which is what made the first game so memorable.I dare to say you could\u2019ve just watched a play through of the game on YouTube and it still would\u2019ve had the same effect because the last of us was basically an animated movie where you also had the control of the character which only made it slightly more engaging.Think of Last of Us Part 2 as a human being.A really really beautiful and good looking human being. Think of the design\\, gameplay and graphics as the skin and flesh of the game\\, and the story as the heart and soul of it.Now what\u2019s a body without a soul??That\u2019s right; a corpse.And what do you do with a corpse?? You bury it. Because there\u2019s no bit of life left in an empty shell to help it keep living.And that\u2019s exactly the case with TLOU 2.It may be ALMOST perfect in other aspects\\, but as long as the story doesn\u2019t work\\, none of it is worth it. Much rather it makes it even more disappointing. Because you keep playing the game with a sense of shame and pity about it all the way thinking to yourself \u201cwhat a great game it COULD HAVE become.\u201dI barely finished the game\\, and as soon as I did\\, I sold my copy and am never gonna touch it again. It was a painful\\, torturous journey\\, that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon my evilest enemy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
