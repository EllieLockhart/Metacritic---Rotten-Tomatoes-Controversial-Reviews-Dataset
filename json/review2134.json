Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A surprisingly clever continuation of the star wars saga. For me personally it might be the best handcrafted movie in the series. Sure it is a divisive film\\, and of course taste is subjective\\, but the fan score on this site reflects childish acts by entitled children rather than the quality of the movie. My choice of giving it topp score comes down to my personal taste\\, but 40 percent is just dumb and objectivly wrong.","true":true}
