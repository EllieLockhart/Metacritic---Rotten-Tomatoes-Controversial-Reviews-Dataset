Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining until you realize you just watched hours of pointless plot line\\, for some unexplained reason the Rebel's went from being the super power of the Galaxy to a group of about 20 incompetents under Leah's leadership where running constantly is equated with wisdom\\, Episode 9 has literally no draw or purpose to it\\, and that all of Star Wars lore was flushed down the toilet. Other than this\\, it was pretty entertaining.","true":true}
