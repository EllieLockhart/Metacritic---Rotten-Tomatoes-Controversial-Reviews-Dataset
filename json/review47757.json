Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When subverting expectations is given a higher level of value then the overall story\\, character growth\\, characters being true to themselves\\, and so on. This is a film made by someone who was more interested in shocking the audience with decisions than treating the characters and story we all love with the respect that it deserves. I have never been more disappointed leaving a film in my life.","true":true}
