Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a good movie...BUT...an utterly horrific Star Wars story.  The events of the Force Awakens apparently didn't happen.  The main villains are made to look like imbeciles.  New characters are introduced but have zero reason for being there.  The jokes are force choked down your throat ( just like this pun) .  Everything the Force Awakens built up (Snoke\\, Rey's lineage\\, etc) means zero.  Snoke is a throw away\\, Hux is a boob\\, Phasma is a poor man's Boba Fett (what a waste of a fantastic character). The sub plots are useless.  Finn & Rose are completely useless.  And why the hell is Poe not told the plan??? There's so much more that is bad\\, but I'm getting angry just typing.  Save your money movie people.  This one is just bad.","true":true}
