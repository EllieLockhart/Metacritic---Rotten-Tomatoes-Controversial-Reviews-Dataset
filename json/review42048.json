Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes some unconventional choices\\, but ultimately brings new ideas and strengthens the characters so much. In The Force Awakens\\, Rey is lost and tries to find her place. Rian Johnson takes that and makes it the core of the character. She is actually no one. She won't get any help\\, she needs to define who she is on her own. Couldn't get more emotionally resonant than that. I'm thankful for this movie\\, especially after watching episode IX.","true":true}
