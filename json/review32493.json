Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars review. \\n\\nI was a Star Wars fan. I never reviewed a film before. This film was so bad it made me angry.  People should not be payed to make this bad of a movie. The reason I created an account on here and wrote this review was to vent how angry I am that I saw this film. Also\\, hopefully public outrage from real fans and theater goers somehow prevents such a colossal mistake in filmmaking from happening again. The biggest studio made this film with basically an unlimited budget. They screwed up big time. It felt like they never even watched other Star Wars films\\, didn't like or respect the fans. For sure I will never pay to go to any Star Wars films in the future\\, I won't be buying any merchandise anymore\\, and I will cancel my plans to visit the planned Disney World Star Wars Land. Thats how much I disliked this film. \\n\\nAlso of note\\, I could have written much more about how I disliked this film\\, and how any fan could have done a better job for a fraction of the price of whoever the clowns are that made this film got payed. \\n\\nI stopped writing this review halfway through\\, but this is what I managed to put in writing \\nFilmmakers please take note for future films. \\n\\n\\nMy short review:\\nThe movie was horrible.\\n \\n\\nMy theater experience:\\nI received an invitation to see a free screening of \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\". Usually if I get these screening opportunities\\, they are a few weeks\\, to a few months before a movies release. In exchange the film makers want feedback on the movie. This takes place in the form of a discussion with them at the end of the screening and the filling out of a questionnaire. \\n\\nThis is the first screening invite I have received after a movie has already had its wide release. The explanation I can surmise is that the vast discrepancies in reviews between the critics who overwhelmingly praised the movie and the fans whom overwhelmingly disparaged the movie has created a curiosity as to what went wrong. If this miss match ever occurs (which is rare) the results are usually skewed in the opposite direction:  critics pan the movie\\, while fans praise. Never vice versa. \\n\\nMy detailed review: \\nAfter seeing the movie\\, I know what went wrong...\\n\\nDefining Star Wars\\, part 1\\, Generally\\, What is Star Wars? \\n(And how this was ruined in The Last Jedi)\\nLet's first define what Star Wars is. Star Wars in the most general aspect is science fiction. That is to say\\, fiction based on science. We may have different polices though out different work environments and different laws depending on what state\\, country or epoch we live in. But\\, the laws of physics as we understand them are the same throughout the universe. And it is these very laws of physics that science is based on. No matter where you travel within the universe\\, the laws of physics still apply. Star Wars as it is presented\\, is a tale that happened \\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far away\\\". But\\, the laws of physics still apply. (Except when using \\\"The force\\\". The force is one of three main pillars of what constitutes a Star Wars movie. More on this later). \\n\\nWithin the first few minutes of 'The Last Jedi' The movie insults anyone who has ever visited a science museum\\, or taken a physics course by showing 'gravity bombs' being used in deep space. Why would bombs drop in space\\, with the same gravitational force as we have on earth!? Scientific discrepancies like these make it difficult for a viewer to suspend disbelieve. The most used defense of this that I have seen is that this is just a children's movie\\, and that these details don't matter. This logic is abhorrent.  If anything\\, the fact that children do watch these movies should inspire a moral imperative to get the scientific facts correct as this will help educate our youth in an entertaining setting that they will likely not be forgotten. In addition\\, this also violates a major teaching of fiction and fantasy genre story writing. If you establish a fantasy or fiction 'world' you also have to establish the laws and physics of that world at the time of writing\\, and you must not violate those laws once established! Screen writers know this! This is storytelling 101!\\n\\nReviewing and studying the entire Star Wars cannon before writing a new movie script is important and its very obvious that the people involved with this film\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" did not do this. Violating rules established over 40 years and many movies also\\, makes it incredibly difficult to suspend disbelief. We all know its fiction\\, but for a brief two hours in a dark movie theater we want to trick our minds into believing its all real. This becomes increasingly difficult when you violate storytelling rules that have been established over time based on human psychology. In every other Star Wars installment\\, it takes years of study and practice with a mentor to learn \\\"The Force\\\". But\\, in the Last Jedi\\, you have a main character\\, Rey\\, learning the force by just breathing a few times? This doesn't make any sense within the Star Wars established fiction! When you break fundamental laws of storytelling\\, many times within one film\\, it shouldn't be to anyone's surprise why the audience reactions were so negative!\\n\\nAt its very fundamental level\\, Star Wars is an established science fiction saga that has been in the collective consciousness of the world for many years. This film\\, The Last Jedi\\, did not adhere to (1) established science or (2)\\, the previously established Star Wars fiction. Therefore\\, strictly speaking\\, at a fundamental level\\, it is not a Star Wars movie. It is something else. Some of the faces may be the familiar\\, but everything else is different. \\n\\nDefining Star Wars part 2\\, Who are the main characters? \\n(And how this was broken in The Last Jedi)\\nThere are many characters in the Star Wars saga. They come and go. But there are two main characters that appear in every installment of Star Wars. \\nDespite what many people think\\, the two main characters of Star Wars are the droids (robots)\\, R2-D2 and C3PO. They provide the constant to which everything else is in flux. The story arcs and bends\\, but the scaffolding is provided by R2-D2 and C3PO. Audiences fell in love with these characters. They are forever a part of pop culture. \\n\\nWhat was the reason to create a new main character robot\\, BB8\\, once Disney bought Star Wars? Is there some contract clause that every time they use a George Lucas created character they have to pay more money than if they came up with their own characters? That is the only explanation I can surmise. It makes no sense not to continue and have the stories revolve parallel to that of the two droids\\, R2-D2 and C3PO. You have established robot personas that people love\\, can not age or perish because they are computers\\, are engraved within our collective consciousness or the entire world\\, and Disney minimizes the role of these two robots? That's a huge error!People are flocking to theaters to catch a glimpse of Star Wars as defined by the previous canon lore. Not some new fiction created at a board meeting based on cash flow. These droids\\, R2-D2\\, and C3P) are characters that provide the string that binds the different movies together. You cut them out\\, you also cut the string. The movies don't flow into each other as well. You make it more difficult to suspend disbelief. \\n\\nThe defense of this perhaps is that\\, it can be argued that the saga is about the Skywalker family? Or perhaps this is a saga about the force? Yes\\, this is all true\\, but from a character perspective\\, the saga is fixated on the two original droid characters. The Skywalker family is paramount\\, but individual Skywalker's come and go. The force is not a character. The force is a kind of mathematical variable within the science fiction canon that allows the to writers to bend the laws of physics. Not a character. The force is a main feature\\, but not a character of the fictional universe. \\n\\nMinimizing the roles of R2-D2 and C3PO within the story of The Last Jedi was a fundamental error in storytelling continuity. The studio took away the main characters.\\n\\nDefining Star Wars part 3\\, briefly what is The Force?\\n(And how this was broken in The Last Jedi)\\nAs stated above\\, \\\"The Force\\\" is a kind of mathematical variable within this science fiction film series that allows the characters to bend the laws of physics as we know them. You have well established laws of how this 'Force' works and the time it takes one to learn how to use it within the Star Wars saga. The Force is a main feature component of the Star Wars fiction. It's not some abstract detail. Everyone is going to recognize that in this film you have characters learning how to use the force within a few days by just breathing with their eyes closed\\, however in every other Star Wars film installment it was established that it takes years to learn and time spent studying with a master to learn the ways of the Force! \\n\\nIn fact\\, it is this long period of learning time that makes the Force relatable on a human level. Many things in life take a long time to master. People may have talent\\, but it takes years of hard work to truly master skills such as various occupations\\, games like chess and go etc. This was part of the childhood lesson of Star Wars. You need to seek out and find great teachers and mentors. You have to study and work hard to master the skills you need as an adult.  (These are the kind of things Jim Henson's involvement brought to the story and why his influence on George Lucas was so important to Star Wars\\, more on this later) This film\\, The Last Jedi forgoes this entirely! This is an incredible continuity error. So big of an error that it's clear the writers and directors of this film did not care at all about the Star Wars franchise as previously established. They wanted to do their own thing. That's fine\\, but don't call it Star Wars. \\n\\nIn summary\\, Why this is not Star Wars. \\nThis film purports to be a Star Wars film but it is not. We have previously defined the main three features that stand as pillars for which The Star Wars saga's foundation sits upon. When you don't include or violate the main principles of something in this case\\, Star Wars\\, You can not label it as such\\, a Star Wars film. This is the reason\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"  is a bad Star Wars movie. If we view it as something else\\, perhaps a fantasy flick\\, then it shouldn't be judged so harshly. However\\, this film is sold as Star Wars. And if this is truly a Star Wars film\\, and being installed as part of the story arc\\, then the entire canon is broken. There is no reason to continue watching further installments\\, and there is no reason to rewatch previous films of the saga either. There is no reason to spend money on merchandise or visit theme parks based on Star Wars. The entire cannon makes no sense. \\n\\nWhy these new films will never be Star Wars? What made the original 80's movies special?\\nJim Henson\\, was an American puppeteer\\, artist\\, cartoonist\\, inventor\\, screenwriter\\, and filmmaker who achieved international fame as the creator of the Muppets. His masterpieces also include the films\\, \\\"The Dark Crystal\\\" and the infamous \\\"Labyrinth\\\". Through conversations and with George Lucas\\, Henson was inspirational. The magic that Jim Henson was able to create with his muppets and films was the example that led to the creation of Yoda. It was Lucas\\, Henson\\, Spielberg and that era of 1980's movie making that brought out something special. The new Star Wars movies have none of the original creators and it feels superficially made when comparing to the originals. The Last Jedi was poorly written. The level of thought and detail that was a staple of Lucas films is gone. The foundation of thought that permeated throughout the previous films is gone.","true":true}
