Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't get the bad ratings. This movie is flat out great. I feel like everyone reviewing this movie must be 70 years old because they can't see that this is a perfect movie for the new generation. Even if most old geeks who see this don't like it. I think it is perfect and draws you in and pulls you out at good times with good twists and turns the whole way. Lets be honest because this can't worse than the clone wars movies because there is no Jar Jar binks. This is overall a great movie if you actually know how to enjoy a movie and not blast everything you see!","true":true}
