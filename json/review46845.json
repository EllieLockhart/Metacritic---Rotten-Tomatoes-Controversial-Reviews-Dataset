Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well there goes my childhood. Pure trash. All of the plot holes from 7 were made gaping in this one. Luke is not Luke at all...super Leia? Sorry save your money.","true":true}
