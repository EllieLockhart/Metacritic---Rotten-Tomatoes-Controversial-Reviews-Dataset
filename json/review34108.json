Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"tfa did a great job settings things up (had its flaws\\, but was still a good film)\\, but this movie\\, tears it all down\\, craps all over good characters and destroys any grand imagination anyone could of had in this story\\, turning it in to a story comparable to a children's movie with Disney's classic slapstick humor and rash story twists.","true":true}
