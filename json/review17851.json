Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had some entertaining scenes but's that's only worth half a star because the film is awful. The usual laziness we get these days with films\\, the bad writing\\, the lack of a proper story and pretty much no new ideas just copying stuff seems a lot worse with this film. A truly shocking idea to have the resistance pretty much destroyed in this film\\, which has probably already ruined the next film where we'll see a ridiculously unrealistic comeback that ends too quick with some sort of miracle I reckon. The old Star Wars was winning against the odds with clever tactics\\, this one they come across as incompetent.","true":true}
