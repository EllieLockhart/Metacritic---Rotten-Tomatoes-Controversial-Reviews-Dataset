Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really unfortunate in direction\\, but I suppose stories have to change.  Despite my feelings that these aren't the characters that were developed in the original trilogy\\, it was the terrible script and nonsensical screenplay that drove this movie into the ground.  The constant tonal shifts in a single scene took dramatic moments and turned them into confusion about what we were supposed to be paying attention to and subverted any character development.  How critics defend this is beyond me; the movie is a bad movie\\, not because it's a Star Wars movie\\, but because it doesn't adhere to basic elements of meaningful cinematography and story telling.","true":true}
