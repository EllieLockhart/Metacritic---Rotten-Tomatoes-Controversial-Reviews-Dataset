Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who isn't a big star wars fan\\, this was an enjoyable adventure film. The emotions were credibly shown by most characters and represented well by the music.","true":true}
