Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible story telling\\nNo likable characters\\nDestroys aspects of the star wars world\\nTotally destroys an iconic character\\nMakes force awakens undefendable even to me\\, who has bled star wars since i first saw it in 1980 when i was 4\\nAlienates the fans who made star wars the phenomina it is\\nCant watch this again","true":true}
