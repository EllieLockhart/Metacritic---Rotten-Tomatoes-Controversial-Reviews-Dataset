Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a great movie. Of course I had a lot of things in my mind that I thought would play out differently. However\\, it was a great movie. I loved the fight scene with Rey and Kylo teaming up. Didn't like the Mary Poppins moment or Luke's death. I am okay that Luke dies\\, however\\, if you were going to kill him off\\, why not let it happen in an actual battle. Other than that\\, I liked the movie.","true":true}
