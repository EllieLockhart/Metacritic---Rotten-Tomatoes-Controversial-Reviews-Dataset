Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, it looks like Star Wars and sounds like Star Wars but it is not Star Wars. I tried really hard to like this movie. No sense in repeating what everyone else has pointed out.  I can say this though...  they took out the main ingredient in Star Wars.... George Lucas. Say what you will about the prequels. They at least exist in the same universe as the original trilogy. This story\\, if you can even call it that\\, does not even exist in its own trilogy.","true":true}
