Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give the last Jedi 5 out of ten. \\n\\nLuke sky walker was done horribly. \\n\\n a star destroyer is obviously slow as hell. \\n\\nThe endless Chase of the rebel ships was just stupid. Terrible script. Really who thought this was a good idea!!! \\n\\nI felt like was was watching space balls at times. To much lame humor. Especially in the beginning. Set a bad tone. \\n\\nBut I'm still glad I saw it and I'm sure I will watch the next one also.  \\n\\nMay the force be with you","true":true}
