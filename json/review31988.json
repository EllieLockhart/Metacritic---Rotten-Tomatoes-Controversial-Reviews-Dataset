Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers Ahead:\\nThis movie gets a 5\/5 for me just for subverting the tired and overused trope of \\\"heroes come up with a crazy plan to sneak into X and do Y to save the day\\\"- in the real world\\, crazy plans don't always work\\, and sometimes the people in charge have a solid plan that they don't necessarily have to tell everyone about. By going over his rank\\, Poe discovers the lifepods are being fueled\\, and then leaks that information over spearkerphone to Finn and Rose\\, allowing a completely untrusted third party to overhear and eventually use that information to sell the Resistance out and get almost everyone killed. \\n\\nThis movie has something rare for a Star Wars movie: Nuance. I hope that the producers don't take the 52% score to heart and continue telling an interesting story rather than the cookie-cutter garbage that all of these fans apparently want.","true":true}
