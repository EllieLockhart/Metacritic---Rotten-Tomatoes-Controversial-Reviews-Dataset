Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was like watching a 2.5 hour long Spanish Soap Opera with constant emotional turmoils during every single character arc. Most of them had a unsatisfied conclusion. Was expecting to see a shocking movie. And it was\\, for the most part - shockingly disappointing. Action scenes were great. Humor was brutal. Great performances By Hamill and del Toro.","true":true}
