Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage film. It's apparent now that the agenda was to kill off the old to bring more importance for the new\\, which is fine\\, but Luke deserved way better. The plot was very poor. 75 percent of the movie is a chase through space at maximum flying speed? Space flying? Green milk? No lightsabre duels? Snoke so easily defeated? Rian Johnson takes a dump on everything created by George Lucas. The name of the film should have been Space Balls 2: The Search for More Money. Will never see again.","true":true}
