Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never felt this conflicted about a Star Wars film before. On one hand I really enjoyed parts of it\\, there are some stunning moments\\, it\u2019s emotional\\, powerful and brilliant. On the other hand parts of it infuriated me. There are some baffling creative decisions and plot points which are offensive to the millions of Star Wars fans around the world. Questions are still not answered\\, plot points are forgotten about or brushed aside\\, and the middle section slumps into prequel awfulness. Mark Hamill is sensational as Luke and his story arc with Rey is the highlight of the film. There are some gorgeous moments with great use of sound and cinematography the likes of which we have not seen before in a Star Wars film. It filled me with joy and so when we are subjected to cheap plot devises and twists it really angers me. Ultimately JJ Abrams is left with a monumental mess to clear up in episode 9 as for me the direction taken here has seriously taken Star Wars off track. ","true":true}
