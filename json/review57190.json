Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars film ever produced\\, possibly the worst film ever made. It is superficial where it attempts depth\\, it is clumsy when it attempts to be sober. It has no story to speak of\\, and where it is even coherent one might well wish it were not. You can see the mistakes coming a mile off\\, and just have to sit there saying\\, 'don't do it'. But\\, in the end\\, you just know they're going to do it.","true":true}
