Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was completely enjoyable.....just what a Star Wars movie should be!  The cast was perfect\\, the exciting\\, the homage to the original not overdone.....highly recommend it for a fun time at the movie.  I didn't \\nenjoy Rogue One and wasn't thrilled about seeing The Last Jedi...am so glad I saw it.  I'm back on the Star Wars bandwagon!","true":true}
