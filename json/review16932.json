{"101487":138622,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I originally would have given this movie a solid 3 out of 5 stars. After a couple of years of reflection and absolutely no impulse to rewatch this movie I dropped it to a 2 star movie.\\nYes\\, it is better than the prequels\\, along with the force awakens. Mainly due to the look of the movie they spent 200+ million to make the movie look like Star Wars episode IV\\, a film that in its day maybe cost 10-15million(?!!) Even with inflation\\, I'd guess 50-60!!\\nThe film looks great in parts\\, the space battles etc. But they're forgettable\\, granted I have not rewatched the movie since it came out but why bother...\\nI dont care about any new character they have introduced in Star Wars since return of the jedi! They have not had a memorable character\\, ship\\, or something like the death star...\\nFirstly\\, i think episode 7&8 are better than the prequels.  As I said previously they are both solid 3 out 5 movies. Largely forgettable action sci-fi movies that look great but are devoid of anything new.\\nI do find myself wondering\\, if the prequels looked like these movies would I still like them more?\\nMy biggest problem with the prequels was the look and feel of the 'Star Wars universe ' the extensive cgi dulled my interest very quickly. Yes\\, the characters\\, dialogue and acting are bad and I did not care about the new characters either but I think I would have given them 3 out of 5 stars and said action wise\\, there is lots and it looks great. Shame about the characters. But\\, I remember the Darth Maul duel\\, I remember the Pod race and i have only seen the Phantom menace once in theatres too!!\\n\\nThe prequels\\, you could argue tried and succeeded with new ideas better. The double edged lightsaber was cool\\, people loved the pod race(I didn't) or at least had memorable moments. The last Jedi falls flat on offering anything new and\/or memorable. (It does try)\\n\\nPeople who enjoyed the film sound like they're defending it when they're just saying they didn't hate it.\\nI didn't hate it. It was better than I thought but I probably would not recommend it. If you're a star wars fan you have probably seen it anyway but\\, Star wars fans fall into 3 categories \\n1. anyone over the age of 30 who grew up with the original Star Wars trilogy.  These people either loved it as kids or rediscovered it again in the 90s and were surprised how good it was as adults.\\n2. Casual fans. People that just watch movies for movies. Good or bad.\\n3. Kids whose first experience was either the prequels or these new films.\\n\\nFor kids only time will tell if Star Wars can compete with Marvel\\, Harry Potter\\, Lord of the rings and dominate like in the 80s\\, I dont think it does.\\nThe appeal of Stars Wars is to that first category \\n1. Fans of the original trilogy.\\nAnd that's it.\\nI doubt Star wars is gaining 'new' fans from the last jedi that is why there was a perceived backlash.\\nAfter killing off Han we got a terrible Luke who had nothing in common with Luke from the original trilogy\\, not because he was old. The character\\, his actions and principles had all changed.\\nFor people that grew up with Luke and Han fighting for good and defeating the empire this was a slap in the face.\\nThe whole film is full of dead ends plotwise and red herrings.\\nEven the action is bland\\, yes it looks great but there are no odds\\, there is nothing at stake...\\nAs it ruins Luke. Leia is not in the movie and the sequels we were promised have not arrived.\\n\\nYou dont need to watch any of these movies other than\\nStar Wars\\, The empire strikes back and Return of the jedi.\\nThe rest do not expand\\, build or improve on those movies they actually weaken them a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n...just a little\\n\\nI will stress they tried to build or expand things in this movie and show things from a different view point but\\, showing new force skills is not groundbreaking...and\\, a lot of this film feels like world building for future movies.\\nWe still have At-ATS and the millennium falcon etc. But\\, if this film is set 20-30 years after Star Wars would they not have new weapons??? Is that not like America using the same artillery and weapons in WWII as they did in Vietnam!?!\\nOh\\, wait they're only on display to please crowds. Why think of new ships\\, weapons etc.","true":true}
