Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess. To long\\, entire plot line didnt need to exist\\, stupid cgi characters for the sake of it\\, by the time it got to anything interesting i was to bored an underwhelmed to enjoy it. Honestly the whole codebreaker casino plotline was just ridiculous and probably the main reason the movie sucked so hard. Also did we really need to see luke skywalker milk and alien for green milk?????","true":true}
