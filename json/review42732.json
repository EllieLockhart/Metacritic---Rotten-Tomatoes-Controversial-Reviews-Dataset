Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great! It was fresh and gave new ideas and theories to the Star Wars Universe. I feel that many \\\"hardcore\\\" fans are too wound up in the fact the movie didn't go the way that they wanted. The movie was a surprise and hard to predict. I hope this paves the way for an even better Episode IX","true":true}
