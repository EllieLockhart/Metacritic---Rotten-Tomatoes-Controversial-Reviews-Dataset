Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director of the movie you made bad to ok move i am very on the fence of this move of rating a 5.5 or 6.5 out of 10 for the last jedi. You should have had a more justified why for luke to die. You should have made luke more bad like i am one best jedis. Come one the hole Leia flying back to the ship come on not needed take out of the movie you completely are running star war that grow up to love. There was so much i hated with this move there was lost i loved but over all that is why i can give it 5.5 or 6.5 out of 10 if you would have done some things different i would give it bett rating","true":true}
