Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Different. Exciting. Shocking.\\n\\nAs Luke said in the trailer\\, \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\"\\n\\nBold twists\\, and wonderful surprises scattered throughout the film.\\n\\nI really don't want to give a spoiler filled review\\, so i will say this:\\n\\nIf you are looking for homages to the original films or \\\"Legends\\\" (expanded universe content)\\, and the same old same old: You're not going to like it.\\nIf you have been wanting more out of the Star Wars saga: This might come close to your expectations.","true":true}
