Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in wanting to love it. The whole time\\, I kept asking myself why the First Order didn't just jump a small fleet to light speed\\, jump out ahead\\, and blast the rebel fleet. And that's just one of the blaring inconsistencies. I can't even mention Leah's Marry Poppins moment where she wakes up in the vacuum of space and force flies back into the ship. I almost laughed out loud. I really wanted to like this movie.","true":true}
