Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't think it was possible\\, but The Last Jedi made me appreciate the prequels. Not because they were good\\, but because this movie illustrates just how difficult\\, maybe impossible\\, to capture the magic of the original trilogy. The setting are claustrophobic and uninspired. The plot basically revolves around a premise that is best used for a cliche road trip movie with plot holes you can drive a star destroyer through.. The character motivations make little to no sense \\, basically turning everyone into a two-dimensional caricature of themselves. And then there's Super Leia. \\nThere is so much discussion to be had on just how bad this movie was but I don't want to go into major spoiler territory this early on. Overall\\, this movie proves that the mousey overlord isn't interested in producing quality but will put anything out if it makes them money.","true":true}
