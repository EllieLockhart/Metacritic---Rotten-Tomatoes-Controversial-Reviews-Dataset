Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sooooo much bad\/easy\/stupid things that it ruined the entire movie for me.\\nI love Star Wars. This is bull****. \\nSeems like the writers did not give a sh** about the trilogy\\, the prequels and the animated series.\\nI've said enough.","true":true}
