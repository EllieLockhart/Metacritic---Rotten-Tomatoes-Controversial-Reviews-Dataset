Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as it left me thinking about whether I liked it\\, The Last Jedi gave me a good time. It always feels special watching a Star Wars movie and this new addition is worthy enough to be rated as one of the best. It won't go down the way you think. However\\, it does go down very well excecuted.  The middle dragged slowly due a  specific boring storyline on a casino planet. But once the movie picks up its pace again\\, you will be left with pure entertainment and emotional scenes with all of those beloved characters.","true":true}
