Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching this movie it's hard to believe Ryan Johnson has ever seen Star Wars before let alone likes the franchise. If you like watching a starship slowly running out of gas for 3 hours this is a movie for you. But then maybe it's the correct alagory for the Abrams Star Wars Trilogy. It drags on for hours without getting you to anywhere that resolves needlessly posed mysteries and refuses to build the universe in any meaningful way. I'm a huge Star Wars fan but this movie almost ruiens the franchise for me.","true":true}
