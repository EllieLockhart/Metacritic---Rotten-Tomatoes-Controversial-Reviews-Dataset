Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, I hate it.  I have to say the story is idiotic.  Too many plot holes in the story.  An example might be the whole section of Fin and Rose travelling to Canto Bight Casino can be cut out and it will no difference to the story line.  A waste of  45 mins just to give something for characters to do. \\n  The character is just horrible.  Captain Plasma\\, need I say more.  Waste of talent and characters.","true":true}
