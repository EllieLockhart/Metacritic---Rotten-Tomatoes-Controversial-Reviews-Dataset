Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would like to know which fans did not like this episode.  This episode ranks with Empire Strikes back in greatness.  The story had twists.  The humor is great from Chewie.  Moments happen in which you cheer - more than \\\"Empire Stirkes Back.\\\"  Heroic moments.  This even had moments for which you could say \\\"That's cool!\\\"  Do not believe the audience rating of 3.2 our of 5.  Disney has done a good thing.  No Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
