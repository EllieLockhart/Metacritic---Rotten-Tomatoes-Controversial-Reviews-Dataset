Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the force is now buddhism\\, losing its fun good vs evil simplicity - some of the plot turns were good but emotionally it missed too many notes.  Left unsatisfied and so sad that Carrie Fisher died.  The ending felt so off considering she is not in the next film.  What a waste to kill off Luke.","true":true}
