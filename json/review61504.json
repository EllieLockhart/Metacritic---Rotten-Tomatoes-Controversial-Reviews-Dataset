It was not necessary to show everything of Abby\u2019s life as they even copied lots of models at base that ruins immersion. This part should have been shortened to show us only her relationship with the surgeon killed by Joel\\, as relatable character development couldn\u2019t have been conveyed to the player.I don\u2019t consider it a bad ending. Note that the main objective of the first part was to deliver Ellie to the Fireflies to create a vaccine and such objective wasn\u2019t completed. Joel travels half of the country and at the very end\\, he decides just go home.The real problem was to be forced to play as Abby\\, it felt like measure to emphasize with her (but there is absolutely no way you could do that after seeing her killing Joel) and becomes desperate to the point to save awesome and memorable parts (such as the Seraphite island and Ray King boss fight) to her. It got disgusting when you are prompted to attack Ellie at the theatre (meaning game over if you let Ellie win \u2026 Expand","true":true}
