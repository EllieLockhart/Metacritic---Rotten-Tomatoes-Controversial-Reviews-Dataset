Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually splendid. However\\, Inconsistent plot (basically Battlestar Galactica ep 1 chase in slow motion)\\, attempt at lifting new heroes simply by bastardizing Luke\\, who is now borderline murderer and sociopath. Down your throat one sided gender politics : ALL women are heroes\\, ALL men are either evil\/goofs\/reckless. (Also includes Disney criricizing capitalism -for Real Disney inc. ?). I suspect critics tended to be subjective by fear of appearing politcally incorrect Hence a remarquable gap between current user rating (49%) and critics (91%).","true":true}
