Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't awful but it was disappointing... one critic summed it up best when he said how you reacted to Luke's lightsaber toss would determine your view of the movie. For me it was disconcerting... would he really treat a lightsaber that way??! We suspend our belief because we believe in a galaxy far far away but there were just too many plot holes... Why didn't Admiral Holdo just tell Poe and the crew her plan?? Why was Luke's response to the monster he created to run and hide??  When you couple that with Rey's parentage... sorry it was an entertaining film but a bad Star Wars one.  My sister who hardly watches movies LOVED the film but when I said Rey's parentage was something I was particularly happy with she said surely he was lying... I think this show will be judged in hindsight when we see where the new universe travels to but for now it's a 6.5\/10.","true":true}
