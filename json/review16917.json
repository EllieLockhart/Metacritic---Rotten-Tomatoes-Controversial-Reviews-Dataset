Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I once heard that if I were to rate this a one star then they would not count it with the overall % score. This is so the real % score doesn't become revealed because they do not want the audience real opinion of this movie to be exposed. So I'm giving this a two star even though I would give it a zero star if I knew they would count it. With that said\\, I feel that liberalism\\, feminism and SJW propaganda the leftist Hollywood elitests are attempting to shove down our throats are ruining this once great franchise called StarWars.","true":true}
