Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was disappointed. I don't really like the new star wars movies. I know this is uncommon but the prequels are my favorite. Revenge of the Sith is 1st place to me. I hope the next trilogy will better. I DON'T KNOW HOW\\, BUT THEY ACTUALLY MANAGED TO MAKE IT WORSE THAN THE FORCE AWAKENS AND ROGUE ONE!","true":true}
