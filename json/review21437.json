Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't give any spoilers\\, I'll make this short and brief. It's a really entertaining film. Some parts were a bit slow\\, but overall\\, it's a great action packed film and I was in the edge of my seat in some parts.","true":true}
