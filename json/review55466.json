Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"More of the same predictable Disney formula. Nothing special about this at all. It's pretty unfortunate what they are doing to the series\\, and extremely unfortunate what they did to Leia in that space scene. Whoever had that idea should be fired immediately.","true":true}
