Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was confused to see such a change of course from The Force Awakens with The Last Jedi. All previous plots were disregarded and the characters appeared to be completely different people\\, with different motivations. The plot twists were surprising only in that they made no sense in relation to the plot or why the characters (or director\/writer for that matter) would make those decisions. The film was more concerned with making an ideological point (which I actually agreed with in principle) than having a coherent plot. Ultimately\\, the film was very slow and clumsy.\\n\\nPerhaps most bizarrely\\, large parts of the film seemed completely unnecessary and led nowhere. In fact\\, the film added nothing to the ongoing trilogy\\, which makes sense as it appeared to be a stand alone film\\, entirely different to any other in the Star Wars universe in style\\, background or continuity.","true":true}
