Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wish I had waited till this was free to watch. We all felt deflated by this film\\, and the more I think about it afterwards the more I find that makes no sense. A couple of real face palm moments and lots of jokes that fell flat. Our teenage girls were talking half way through\\, they said it was like old people Harry Potter\\, set in place that's no interest to them. I have to agree.","true":true}
