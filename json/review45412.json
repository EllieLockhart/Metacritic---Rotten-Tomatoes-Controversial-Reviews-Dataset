Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very bad movie. Waste of Mark Hamil's talent. I strongly disliked The Force Awakens as well. Not a fan of the prequels. The only Star Wars movie made after the original trilogy that I enjoyed was Rogue One. The Return of the Jedi should have been the last Star Wars movie ever made. There can be no Star Wars movie with out Darth Vader. ","true":true}
