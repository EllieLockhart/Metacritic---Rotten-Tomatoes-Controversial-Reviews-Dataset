Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"like a lot of people did\\, I had to watch this movie more than once before I gave my official thoughts on it. There were several parts that left the fanboy in me screaming like a little girl\\, but there were also several parts that made me feel like Im having my time wasted. All in all\\, this was a good sequel to The Force Awakens\\, not a pefect sequel\\, but a good one.","true":true}
