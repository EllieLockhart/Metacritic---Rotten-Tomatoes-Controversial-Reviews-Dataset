Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars films. I really appreciated the way the film grapples with themes of disappointment and failure. It would have been really easy to make a Star Wars movie that pandered to exactly what fans and mainstream audiences wanted to see (arguably\\, The Force Awakens does that a bit too much)\\, but I don't think that would have made for a compelling narrative. \\n\\nSure\\, there are flaws with the plot of The Last Jedi\\, but none are so overwhelming that they overshadow the central point of the movie: we must learn from our failures as much as our successes\\, our weaknesses as much as our strengths. I thought Rian Johnson communicated an emotionally and philosophically complex story that really delivered. If you've grappled with grief and disillusionment in a serious way\\, this may be your favorite Star Wars film. I know it's one of mine. \\n\\nThank you\\, Rian Johnson\\, for making a Star Wars film that was so different from and better than my expectations. I look forward to your future Star Wars films!","true":true}
