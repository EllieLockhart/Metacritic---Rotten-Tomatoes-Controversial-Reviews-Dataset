Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is amazing\\, it's something no one could predict and really emotional. There where moments playing this game that I felt like utter **** the theater scene where you play as Abby ruined me\\, and the golf scene was truly brutal. And that's why this game is as good as it is\\, the fact that a game can make you feel this much emotion and true pain is crazy. On top of all that the gameplay is quite compelling\\, the stealth combat is great and the enemy AI is much more developed then most games I've ever played and the graphics are impeccable. I also love how they had the guts to kill Joel\\, and I find it's hilarious that so many people are mad about that\\, that's truly a brutal moment that many creators don't have the guts to do. On top of all that\\, the acting and animations in the game are incredibly well done and actors such as Ashley Johnson and Laura Bailey show incredible performances that honestly make me wish that actors like them got more recognition in the whole industry of popular media\\, seeing as what they do is often much more complicated than what a conventional voice actor from an animated film.Story: 10\/10Gameplay: 9\/10Graphics 10\/10Pisses off incels 10\/10Animations: 10\/10Voice acting: 10\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
