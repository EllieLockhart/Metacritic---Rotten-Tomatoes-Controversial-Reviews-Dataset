Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long-time Star Wars fan\\, but was very disappointed with this installment. Luke\u2019s character was destroyed\\, reduced to a petty cry baby who just kind of dies as the end. Such a shame to bastardize one of the most formative protagonists in film history. All the questions from Force Awakens were answered\\, but not in a satisfying way. Luke a deadbeat runaway\\, that\u2019s the best you could do? And to make it worse\\, the movie ends with zero connection to an Episode 9. You literally don\u2019t need 9; there are no cliffhangers\\, nothing to build on. In conclusion\\, the writer seemed more concerned to play toward our nostalgia than develop a compelling story. He had all the tools\\, but failed to put them to good use.","true":true}
