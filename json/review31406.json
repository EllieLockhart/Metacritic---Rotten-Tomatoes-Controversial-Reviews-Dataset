Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some obvious flaws and a lot of justified criticism from the hard core fans\\, but I found the movie to be entertaining and worth watching. It's really about expectations.  I learned when episode 1 came out that there will never really be an equal for the experience that we had with the original movies\\, but that shouldn't overshadow our willingness to embrace the Star Wars of today. I'm glad that the story continues even if it doesn't always go the way I would like.","true":true}
