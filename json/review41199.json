Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has some fun. exciting\\, and surprising moments. It is enjoyable as a stand alone movie. My wife may have hit it on the head\\, though\\, when she said\\, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the world needs too many more Star Wars movies.\u201d The themes get repetitive\u2014dark vs. light conflict\\, cute droids save the day\\, small parties infiltrate the mothership against all odds\\, etc. The series is almost James Bond-like in the need to be adhere to what has come before. For that reason\\, while the movie is definitely enjoyable\\, it struggles to recreate the magic of Episode IV and Episode V. The backdrop is becoming too familiar.","true":true}
