Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am absolutely shocked by the negative response to this movie.  Walking out of the theater I was thinking that it might be my favorite Star Wars movie\\, but before I could say that my 11 year old son said it was by far his favorite of the movies\\, and he is pretty hard to please.  The last hour was one of the most immersive experiences I have had in a theater\\, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!","true":true}
