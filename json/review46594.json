Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watery plot that creates no character arcs for the protagonists. The main characters learn very little and the audience is shown that the entire plot was a \\\"failure\\\" with no consequence besides a romance between Rose and Finn. \\n\\nConfusing lack of fan-service compared to TFA. Why not deliver on the fans expectations like all of the Marvel super hero movies do? Why is Star Wars the film-makers experiment with making a new type of drama instead of a fun wizard fantasy\/adventure movie like all of the rest? The result is a movie that feels forced and has too many fake-outs and plot-twists that its impossible to feel invested in the story or characters.","true":true}
