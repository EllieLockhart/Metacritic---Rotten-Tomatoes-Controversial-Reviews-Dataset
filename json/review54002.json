Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I appreciate Rian Johnsons attempt at Star Wars. I respect and admire his work and his passion for this franchise. Still\\, this is not the way I wanted it to be treated. I don't agreed with his handling of my hero Luke Skywalker. I don't appreciate the reused themes from ESB and ROTJ. I don't agree with the portrayal of The First Order being so powerful so quickly and that there isn't a larger Resistence or remnants of the Republic. I never thought I'd say this\\, but I wish theyd consult with George Lucas more. His prequel trilogy was flawed\\, but at least it had more originality and creativity. The prequels took more risks that were far more interesting to watch. I literally have to turn my mind off to watch TLJ to enjoy it. This is just my feelings\\, but I totally understand and respect that others will enjoy this movie. It's just not for me.","true":true}
