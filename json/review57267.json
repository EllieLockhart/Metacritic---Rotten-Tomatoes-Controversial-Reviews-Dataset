Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has flaws but what movie doesn\u2019t. Spoilers from here With luke being the way he is remember it has been over thirty years since episode VI For leia flying through space don\u2019t nitpick it because leia is using the force. Snoke is just a red herring villain and just there to develop Kylo. Canto Bight is there to show that there are people who help both sides and no one can be just good and evil. Hopefully you learned something and may the force be with you","true":true}
