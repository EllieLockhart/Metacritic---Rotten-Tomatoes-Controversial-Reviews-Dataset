Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social Justice Wars: The Lost Jedi was even worse than The Phantom Menace. At least that movie  despite Jar Jar\\, pod racing\\, bad dialogue\\, and little Anakin held true to the overall vision and theme of the saga. This moving was an over hyped mess.\\nShow your continued disgust and BOYCOTT SOLO.\\n\\nThe official critics must have been paid to produce positive reviews. This movie is garbage.\\n\\nTied for second worst Star Wars movie. He did what Jar Jar couldn't do which is to completely ruin the series. It was bad. There were a few good points in it though. Rey and Kylo were utilized well. The acting\\, overall was good. The character development of the primary characters was good\\, but the secondary characters\\, including Luke\\, were either mishandled or written poorly. Below are my top 10 problems with this movie. Warning\\, they contain spoilers\/\\n\\n10. Force Skype\\n9. Virtual lightsaber battle at the end.\\n8. Psuedo pod racing scene with animal rights angle.\\n7. Over-the-top feminist themes intensified.\\n6. Continued hatred and exclusions of white males in the cast\\, unless cast as evil.\\n5. Snoke was a strong\\, strong character. Why kill him off so easily?\\n4. Only 3 lessons of Jedi training?\\n3. Porg.\\n2. The movie started off as a comedy. The jokes were funny\\, but Star Wars is NOT a comedy.\\n1. Leia survives being sucked out into space without a space suit on.\\n\\nIt's not exactly as bad as the Phantom Menace\\, but it isn't much better. Probably on par with ATOC.\\n\\nHere are two additional problems with the movie.\\nSnoke's origin and source of training\/power never explained. How Luke dies.","true":true}
