Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a diehard SW fan.  I read the books\\, I collect the merch\\, I even build custom Lightsabers.  I left this movie with ZERO interest in seeing EP9.  Everything that was built up in EP7 was thrown out.","true":true}
