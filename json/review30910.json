Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social media and movies just don't go together... The movie was great. People's argument about what's wrong with it is unsubstantiated and bandwagoning. The movie had fantastic fight scenes with a message that is appropriate for the length of this franchise. See it for yourself. Remember people b**** about George Lucas prequels too. It's amazing...
