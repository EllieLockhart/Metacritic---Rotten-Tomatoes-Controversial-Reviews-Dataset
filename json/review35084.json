Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I saw this movie I was into it but felt uneasy about the writing\\, specifically the character work of Luke. After sitting down and watching it again I found myself finding more and more holes. Usually multiple viewings bring out the good that you missed the first watch but The Last Jedi is the complete opposite. The Throne room fight scene with two guards that simply dance off screen and wave the poles around. Leia in space... Rey lifting rocks to save the day... Holdo... The main cast not interacting with each other at all... the millions of dollars put into the visual and audio work cover it for a little while but underneath that is just a bad movie.","true":true}
