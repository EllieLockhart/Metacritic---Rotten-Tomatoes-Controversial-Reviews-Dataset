Didn't read the reviews until I'd finished to avoid spoilers and I'm stunned at how half the internet seems to have it! The storytelling I thought was so clever and original. Initially when we went back a few days and relived the story as Abby I just couldn't wait to get back to the confrontation but seeing everything from Abby's perspective and seeing the hurt Ellie had caused really made me question whose side I was on.\r\rJoel's death was gruesome and horrendous\\, but Abby was trying to find vengeance for her father in the same way we had come to understand Ellie was. I was glad at the end that Ellie spared her. It seems there's no good guys and bad guys in the post apocalyptic world\\, just different shades of loss.\r\rBasically\\, I think I felt all the things the writers wanted me to feel and I wonder if maybe it was easier for me because I didn't play the first game (I just watched a recap on YouTube) so I wasn't quite as emotionally attached to Joel and Ellie as some other may have been.\r\rStory aside\\, so much of the game was immersive and visually stunning. Escaping from the scar island under the burning debris was incredible\\, as was much of the dark immersive parts with infected coming at you from nowhere\\, and the intensity of the sniper scene where you feel angry when he kills Manny only for you to then discover it's Tommy.\r\rIt felt like a level of storytelling that wouldn't be possible in a film and for the first time in a very long time I was disappointed when the game ended and I wanted more.\r\rI really don't understand all the negative reviews\\, this experience was completely epic.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
