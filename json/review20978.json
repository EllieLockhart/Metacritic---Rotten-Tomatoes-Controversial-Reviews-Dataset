Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hoping the movie would get better as it went on and on. It just had scenes that dragged on and dumb attempt at jokes. It was nothing like the real Star Wars that Lucas created. It was all Disney\u2019s lame Interpretation of a great film. Star Wars is supposed to be about family\\, fights\\, conflict\\, sides and resolve! Not ships and lame Disney drama. Disney F\u2019ed up Star Wars for good! What a waste of money! ","true":true}
