Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn\u2019t the best Star Wars movie but it has its moments. I feel like this movie had some missed opportunities and there were some parts that were very over the top fan fiction level crazy. This movie could\u2019ve been 2 movies. No one says it must be on 9\\, it\u2019s the end of this saga\\, make it 10. Liked it enough to see it more than once","true":true}
