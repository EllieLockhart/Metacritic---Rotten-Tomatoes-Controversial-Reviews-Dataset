Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney: *rips up actually good and interesting script of story*\\n\\ndisappointing 100%\\n\\nmaybe you could rate it better if you could understand anything that happened in the movie","true":true}
