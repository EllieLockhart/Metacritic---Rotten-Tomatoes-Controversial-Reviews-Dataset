Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was well-made and not awful but there were a lot of plot holes and for such a long run time it felt rushed\\, as if I was watching two movies that had been spliced together. The compression of the timeline messed with the characterization and a lot of the actions characters took seemed forced\\, like the writers were just trying to accommodate the plot. I wasn't a huge fan of TFA either\\, but I liked it more than this\\, if only because it felt more well-paced and well-written and it had heart throughout\\, whereas this didn't really connect with me emotionally until the very end. All in all\\, it's pretty mediocre. I appreciated that there was an attempt to take risks and be original\\, but a lot of the plot also felt recycled from the original trilogy. Rogue One has still been my favorite of the new Star Wars films so far.","true":true}
