Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I can not believe how childish people are on this site.  Out of the 177\\,000 reviews on here\\, I could not believe the number of reviews I came across that said they only signed up just to give TLJ the lowest score they could just so they could lower the rating.  Not only that\\, but there were a number of reviews where the reviewer said they didnt like TFA and didnt want to see another SW film yet they went to see TLJ even though they said they thought it would be crap going in and had already made their mind up that it would be horrible no matter what and of course after watching it that is how they felt about it.\\n\\n\\nNow me personally\\, I thought it to be a solid film that\\, had it not had the title Star Wars on it\\, would have been liked by more people.\\n\\nI would love to explain things in detail but I think we may still be on a somewhat  spoiler embargo so I will do my best.\\n\\nTHE BAD\\n\\n-The film is a bit clunky and does tend to jump around enough so as to fell disjointed\\n-A good 20 minutes or so could have been cut from the film and most of that 20 could have been cut from one particular scene (you know which one if you saw it)\\n-Some characters once again had a decent build up in trailers and interviews and such bt again were a major let down.\\n-SOme of the comedy bits did seem out of place and could have been omitted.  It was not as good as how it was handled in TFA.\\n-At least one particular story point that causes a heated conflict about midway through the film was a bit needless BUT\\, if anyone has ever been in the military\\, you will know that one character was wrong in his actions.\\n-One use of \\\"force\\\" power\\, wile ok sounding in theory was not nadled well in execution.\\n\\nPositives\\n\\n-As ALways\\, visual effects were amazing.\\n-Chemistry between Rey and Kylo worked and felt believeable.\\n-THough some where mad about it\\, I am glad that there wan't a huge lightsaber duel between 2 characters.  YEs there had alsways been at least 1 so I was happy that there was not one in this film because it made it different.  I mean 7 films with the duelling and you cant have one film withpout?\\n-Acting was over all done really well with Adam Driver going above and beyond with Kylo Ren.  He is easily becoming the best new character of the saga.\\n-Mark Hamil...WOW....WHile some are mad because he didnt seem like the Luke from 34 years ago\\, I actually understand that over 3 decades people can change.  Right now I am 38 years old and am completely different from when I was 8.  Also\\, with the events that he had gone through in that time\\, I can fully understand why he chagemged.\\n-Rian Johnson did a solid directing job and I applaud him for sticking to what JJ did in TFA by shooting on film and using as many practical props as neccesary.  Even one particular scene\\, there was a practicle item used whereas Lucas had CGI'ed it to hell in the prequels.\\n-Dialogue never felt clunky or odd at all.  I mean though it is not saying mych when you are going up against the sagas worst which was about sand\\, it was still solid.\\n\\n\\nI could add even more and go into detail but I feel that I have already made this too long.\\n\\nIf you were not a fan of SW before this film will not change your mind.  If you are an idiot that let's others decide for you if you should see a movie or not\\, especially if you like the series and have no real complaints about any of the films in it so far\\, then you should give it a chance regardless of what others tell you (this also goes for those that overly gush about it).\\n\\nMyself\\, I am a long time fan that grew p with the originals\\, wasnt a huge fan of the prequels (THough Sith was decent) and I enjoyed TFA even though I knew going in it was basically a soft reboot and I emjoyed this episode.  Not the best in the series\\, but not the worst.\\n\\nI will say though that with everything done in this film\\, JJ Abrahms is going to have to really come up with something crazy to bring it to a decet close.","true":true}
