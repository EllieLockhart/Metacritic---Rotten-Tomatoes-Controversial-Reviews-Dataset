Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. The movie threw way too many characters at you causing the film to feel too crowded. In my honest opinion the movie should have focused on it's already established core instead of throwing new characters in the mix the whole thing felt way too rushed. I would put this movie on about the same level as Revenge of the Sith. ","true":true}
