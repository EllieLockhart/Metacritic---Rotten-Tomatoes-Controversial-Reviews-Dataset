Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of my least favorite movies from the Star Wars series; fighting with Ep. 2 for the bottom of the barrel. It\u2019s half mediocre to boring\\, a quarter awful and a quarter good. I generally like the big three good guys\\, and the new addition to the band as well; unfortunately\\, Disney continues it\u2018s streak of crapping on the original trilogy almost every time it touches it.
