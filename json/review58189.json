Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can now tell that this series is being made by Disney. First you have like milking an animal next you have the Mary poppins scene. And not to mention you have the most powerful man in the galaxy\\, a person that an entire generation grew up with and then shared with their children\\, and yet they kill him off in the most distasteful way. Certainly not worthy of a skywalker. Rian Johnson should be embarrassed\\, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega should reflect on why their characters were so good in force awakens but yet so terrible in this film. Roughly 40%  of this films plot felt the same as the time wasting fluff I used in my middle school and high school essays; for what purpose was the \\\"we need gas for our ship\\\" dilemma being drawn out for an hour necessary for. Give us more of the characters we love (including Rey and Fin) and less of the Disney garbage (including Luke saying laser sword\\, poor plot line\\, milking a space cow\\, and Luke throwing the most important light saber in history over his shoulder like it was a piece of turkey bacon). It hurts to say but I would watch the phantom menace multiple times before I watch this again","true":true}
