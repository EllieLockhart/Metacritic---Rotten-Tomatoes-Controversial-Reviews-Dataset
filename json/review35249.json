{"101487":174676,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-05","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good:  \\n\\n- One of the best LOOKING Star Wars films to date.\\n- Both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley do a good job of further building their characters - Adam Driver does an exceptional job in this film.\\n- Fights and visual effects are great.\\n- Many twists and turns that you don't see coming\\n- The relationship building and scenes between Kylo and Rey are great.\\n\\nThe bad and the ugly:\\n\\n- Luke's character arc is confusing\\, so say the least.  IMO\\, it doesn't jive with where the character has been and where he was projected to go.  Won't spoil it too much\\, but even Mark Hamill was pretty vocal about this same point.  And because his arc is pretty integral to the entire film\\, it leaves much to be desired.\\n- We desperately needed to see more flashbacks to Luke's academy and Kylo's temptation by Snoke.  What they showed us in this movie was not enough to explain Ben's transformation or Luke's sudden loss of will. \\n- The side plot on Canto Bight with Finn and Rose is pretty pointless in the grand scheme of things\\, and becomes some weird social justice crusade. (Hey\\, good job saving the dog-horses and not the slave kids!)  It all leads to them getting caught and making no progress that actually helps in the end.  It also keeps Finn away from Poe and Rey (relationships that NEEDED to be further cultivated\\, as they were in the OT) and ends with the death of a character who should have gotten more development.  \\n- The Holdo character made no sense and her dynamic with Poe (and constant dismissal of him as nothing more than a quick-triggered flyboy) results in endless amounts of damage to the resistance.  She's supposedly 'redeemed' at the end\\, but it's really too little\\, too late.  A simple dialogue or two with Poe to get them on the same page would have saved a lot of lives and time.  \\n- Poe's character really got no progression.  Most of the movie is him getting yelled at or slapped by the female leads\\, in some weird feminist way.  Both Poe and Finn\\, who should be similar in stature to Han and Leia from the OT\\, still have very little character development and haven't had more than a handful of minutes of screen time together.  Unlike in the OT\\, where Han and Leia are pretty much together the whole time and Luke is around except for his trip to Dagoba\\, the trio of Rey\\, Poe\\, and Finn have spent very little time together.  There's only this odd false dynamic between them that would never have developed that quickly in real life.  I understand the Rey\/Kylo relationship takes center stage\\, but Finn and Poe are critical characters for the 'ground' game\\, just like Han and Leia were in the OT.  \\n\\nIn the end\\, there are many flaws that could be pointed out\\, but I have a feeling that we won't be able to give a final review of this movie until after Episode 9.  My hope is that 9 will tie a bunch of loose ends and that what seems to be fact in 8 will be revealed as something different in 9.","true":true}
