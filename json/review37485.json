Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are some flaws with this movie. There are plot holes\\,and some characters are not used enough(Snoke). Why most people\\,I have realized\\, don't like this movie is because the characters are different. For example\\, Luke is drastically different from his 4\\,5\\,6 character. Though\\,this is to be expected. Luke has been isolated for years\\,and has not accepted his role as an legendary figure in the galaxy.Thus\\,his view on force users are shifted and he shuts himself out from the force. The main thing is that this movie wants is to forget 4\\,5\\,6.This is causing many fans to be mad at this movie.I enjoyed this movie. The one scene that I don't like is when Leia so shows survives the vacuum of space.","true":true}
