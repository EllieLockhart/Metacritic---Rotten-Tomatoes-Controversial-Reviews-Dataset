Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler coming:\\n\\nWith the Disney take on the Force\\, as a yin and yang that must remain in balance\\, they have set the stage for disappointment to anyone expecting or simply hopThe two parts must rem in balance\\, so in Disney's Star Wars Universe we are forever stuck with \\\"Meh\\\" endings.  So basically what they've done is to change the Star Wars movie platform into a simple boxing ring.  Neither side can be vanquished\\, we can only hope to witness a decent battle.  While last Jedi delivers that\\, it's so much less than the average moviegoer wants\\, it leaves us yearning for that Victorious feeling we left the theater with after the original\\, but knowing that we can never ever get that again.  Instead we're left paying ever higher movie fares for the latest offering\\, that has been engineered by the Disney machine like a Bag of Doritos\\, never satisfying with just one\\, leaving you hungry for more\\, and hoping for some closure that never comes","true":true}
