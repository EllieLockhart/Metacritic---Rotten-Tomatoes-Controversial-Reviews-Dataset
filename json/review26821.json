Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One moment there is a space-chicken\\, the other killing. You cannot laugh and cry from one second to another. Pretty bad movie and with little realism in the plot\\, meaning the story goes on for the sake of the story.","true":true}
