Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tedious battle\/fight scenes spattered with unnecessary melodrama and uninspiring action that lacked the illusion of risk or vulnerability. If you ever wondered what Star Wars would be like if directed by James Cameron\\, I think this gives a rather good impression. \\n\\nI grew up on the original Star Wars and enjoyed the last two (Episode 7 and Rogue One)\\, but this was a disappointment. Without spoiling the film\\, I was particularly irked by the final scene just before closing credits - you know the one I mean!","true":true}
