Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"some will like it and some wont. people are different are so are their perceptions and opinions. \\n\\nWhat is upsetting beside the film is how critics are insulting the intelligence  of the people who didn't like the film by suggesting that's because it has more women\\, people of color\\, that they dont get it\\,  blah blah.\\n\\nwomen \/ men \/ creatures don't account to anything if the part they play is just a pile of ape shit. all that matters is a good story and its proper execution.\\n\\nthere is something terribly rotten with rotten tomatoes. \\n\\n92% for this film. omg\\, wtf","true":true}
