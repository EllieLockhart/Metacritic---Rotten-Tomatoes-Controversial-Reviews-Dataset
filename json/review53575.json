Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely dissapointed at the mishandling of the Luke Skywalker charechter\\, who was painted extremely differently to how the charechter is intended to be. Not only that but after being teased his reappearance after all of episode 7 to only see him for very brief segments was a let down.\\nThe new trilogy charechters where bland and boring\\, I've felt no connection to them\\, whereas by episode 2 and 5 (The middle of their respective trilogy) I felt a strong attachment to the main heroes.\\nThe plotline itself was very odd\\, and felt... uninspired. A slow chase through space? How thrilling.\\nAlso the movie took a random half hour break to a gambling based planet with Finn and the worst charechter to Grace the screen of a star wars movie since Jar Jar Binks\\, 'Rose'. Where the two went off on an adventure to save the pwetty animals and learn how the upper class is bad.\\n\\nThe only good things about the entire movie was the charechter development of Kylo ren\\, the only charechter the new films birthed worth a damn\\, and Mark Hamill.\\nThat's it. \\nBring back luke.","true":true}
