Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been so indifferent on a Star Wars film\\, it's either I think it's amazing or I think it's garbage\\, but the Last Jedi has me torn. You could argue that The Last Jedi has the best scene in the entire Star Wars Saga\\, but you could also say that it has the worst scene in the entire series. \\nI had a few problems with the last Jedi but they all boil down to the fact that I think the execution of director Rian Johnson was not there. The movie had a lot of good ideas but some of them didn't work for me. For instance\\, the whole plot with Rose and Finn made no sense for the movie. I think both Rose and Finn are great characters\\, but their side plot could've been cut out completely.\\nBut this movie had the best fight scene out all the Star Wars films in my opinion. Watching Rey and Kylo team up to fight Smoke's guards was my favorite part of the entire film\\, maybe even the entire series. But overall I liked the movie\\, but it is not better than Rogue One and The Force Awakens in my opinion.","true":true}
