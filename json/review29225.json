Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Re-posted review as last attempt failed:\\nThis short review is from a non Star Wars fan: This movie was simply put embarrassing and frankly laughable. (1) Many plot holes. (2) A waste of a good villain with hardly a good backstory. (3) Totally superfluous side-mission that seemed to lead to nowhere. (4) Lazy storytelling. (5) Agonizing and unnecessarily tedious second act. (6) Underutilized interesting characters. (7) Porgs! a shameless merchandising gimmick. (8) Uneven pacing. (9) Odd tonal shifts due to misplaced humour. A half star rating is half a star too much.","true":true}
