Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the deepening of the Jedi universe was so awesome. I thought the throwbacks were amazing! Sure the plot has some Holes. But all of them do! (Ewoks) but this film just had so much fun. And that what these are for! Think back to your fist movie\\, did you care what critics thought? Just sit and enjoy and have fun again. Accept!
