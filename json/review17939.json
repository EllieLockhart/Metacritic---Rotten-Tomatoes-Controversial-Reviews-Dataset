Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think i made it about 10 minutes into this movie before turning it off. Keep in mind that i was on a 17 hour flight to japan and instead decided to watch every other movie they had\\, come back to TLJ\\, and then turn it off at the same moment. The moment was when snoke told kylo he looked like an idiot wearing his helmet. Why? Why do that to your villian? Could you imagine if palpatine did that to vader?","true":true}
