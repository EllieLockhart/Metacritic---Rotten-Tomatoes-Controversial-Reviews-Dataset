Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did initially like this movie when i saw it\\, and thought\\, at 3.30am as i got home from the midnight showing ... yeah\\, it was good.\\n\\nBut\\, then i slept on it\\, and the mediocre parts of the film were so distasteful that i couldn't really equate this reconciliation with a number.\\n\\nI hated more of the film than i liked about it\\, and while it is competent\\, the one feeling i have is that they murdered every single character. What i'm left with is an awful movie that makes the prequels better. it makes Force Awakens ultimately unnecessary. \\n\\nEvery decision in the movie is so broken and leaves large plot holes. No character is left unscathed in how terrible their role is. I winced at seeing Leia\\, Hux\\, Poe\\, Holdo\\, Rose\\, Fin\\, Luke\\, Rey\\, Snoke\\, Kylo become badly written\\, forced idiots in the situations. The idea of being a hero\\, is shattered in pieces which is very odd for a hero mythology series. The idea of sacrificing yourself to protect others is subverted and sabotaged and it's weird to see this happen more than once on-screen when so many people are being slowly decimated and killed off\\, ship by ship. \\n\\nI do want people to see this\\, but only because i have no sense of what people enjoy about this movie\\, and i want to know what they do like about it. I am struggling to see if the people who enjoy this movie\\, understand the problems\\, or are capable of ignoring them. \\n\\nI.e. what do they think about the rebellion suicide bombing their enemy. It never comes up except to think ... why didn't they do this earlier. And\\, it's true. It opens up the whole cheapness of asteroid bombing planets you don't like\\, which is going to be a great movie for children to watch in the next episode\\, as their female hero Jedi encourages\\, helps\\, watches and cheers on the destruction of an entire city in the next film\\, because they're not going to win with 10-20 rebels left.","true":true}
