Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only truly awful Star Wars movie ever made\\, it would take a 20 page essay to go over all the problems so just go watch reviews on Youtube instead of this movie. I'm mainly just really sad for J.J. Abrams\\, personal tragedy tore him away from his trilogy which had some real potential. Instead\\, Rian Johnson threw away whatever plans Abrams made and along with Kathleen Kennedy ruined whatever hope there was for this trilogy. Add in some frivolous writing they succesfully achieve their goal of \\\"subverting expectations\\\" by spitting on established lore and beloved characters. But Disney made their money and the people responsible for this mess still have their jobs so I guess what we can take away from this is that Disney doesn't care what anyone thinks as long as they make their money.","true":true}
