{"101487":193248,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Warning: Spoilers below*\\n\\nThis film was terribly disappointing and is the weakest film in the franchise-even worse than \\\"The Phantom Menace\\\".  For all of its flaws (Jar Jar\\, Sidious' complex political machinations) at least Episode I concluded with the epic battle between Obi Wan and Maul.  Cue \\\"Duel of the Fates\\\" choir singing in Sanskrit.  Instead\\, this film which ended only with a mockery of a \\\"duel\\\" between Kylo and Luke.\\n\\nThe main problem with this film is that it fails to build substantively upon the fascinating plot developed in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\".  Unanswered questions abound:\\n\\n1) Who the hell is Snoke?\\n\\n2) Since the defeat of the Empire in \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\"\\, how did the First Order rise so successfully and how did the Resistance\/Republic descend to such a dire\\, pathetic state in which they revert to the rag-tag band of militants \u00e0 la the original rebel alliance?\\n\\n3) How was Anakin's lightsaber retrieved from Bespin?\\n\\n4) Who the hell are Rey's parents?  The film appears to contradict itself on this matter: to Snoke\\, Rey is a Skywalker\\, but according to Kylo\\, she's the daughter of paupers.  But if the latter were true\\, how does one explain Rey's psychic connection with Luke's island\\, or her affinity to his old lightsaber and all its memories?\\n\\nFor all its cheap humor (yes\\, I said it-cheap)\\, the entire film deals with major issues in anticlimactic\\, irreverent fashion completely unbecoming of the original trilogy's epic grandeur: \\n\\n1)  After an agonizing cliffhanger wait between this film and its predecessor\\, Luke nonchalantly tosses his father's lightsaber off a cliff\\, showing that Rian Johnson didn't even have the balls\\, or was simply too lazy\\, to address the complex question of the lightsabre's provenance.\\n\\n2) Luke's history with Kylo (including the details of Kylo's turn to the dark side) at the Jedi school is also given the bare minimum of plot development.\\n\\n3) After slapping Rey silly with his mastery of the force\\, Snoke\\, the supposedly bad-ass Sith lord\\, is killed in stunningly simple fashion.\\n\\n4) Rey's Jedi training is nothing but ranting from a cynical Luke (nothing of the rigorous physical activity and soul-searching we saw Yoda put Luke through in Episode 5).  She apparently becomes a Jedi spontaneously\\, with almost no training.\\n\\n5) Yoda appears from outta nowhere\\, only to burn down a tree.\\n\\n6) Admiral Hodo's highly effective kamikaze plan was executed at literally the 11th hour (why the hell didn't she do it earlier and save the rebels a whole lot of misery?!).\\n\\n7) The only lightsaber duel in the film was nothing more than an elaborate illusion: Luke never got the chance to exhibit his lightsaber prowess in actual combat.\\n\\n8) Finally\\, and most comically\\, Luke\\, the most powerful Jedi who ever lived\\, has claim to the distinct title of being the only Jedi in the franchise to die of nothing more than strenuous meditation.  \\n\\nTo conceal its lack of plot depth\\, the film employs various visual smokescreens: the adorable squealing penguins on Luke's island\\, Luke milking a sea-cow\\, the First Order's gratuitous canon fire at Luke\\, the extended space chase of the rebel fleet.  Yet\\, all of this film's visually-appealing distractions make it more spectacle than substance.  The most ludicrous moment was Leia's flying through the cold vacuum of space like f***ing Sailor Moon.  Now that was unbelievable\\, even for a franchise rich in fictionality.\\n\\nSurprisingly\\, most reviews of this film are glowing and fail to notice that the film has more holes in its plot than a block of swiss cheese. Like Kylo deceived by the illusion of Luke's projection\\, these foolish reviewers seem to have been taken in by the film's empty spectacle.\\n\\nMoreover\\, I take offense with the film's casual killing-off of Admiral Ackbar at the start (for goodness sake\\, that fish who's been around since Episode 6 should have died in a more epic and honorable fashion)\\, and its disjointed narrative flow: the film poorly transitions from plot arc to plot arc\\, such that it appears we are pausing the battle between Kylo and Luke to watch the rebels' escape\\, before hitting the play button on the duel yet again.  This stop-start narrative flow is distracting\\, making it appear that so much happened over there\\, while practically no time passed over here in the interim.  This poor narrative flow is exacerbated by the fact that the entire film revolves around a depressing two-and-a-half hour spaceship chase\\, making very little happen in the way of plot development as not much progress can be made beyond the fuel-strapped rebel cruiser\\, whose doomed fate hangs onerously over the entire film.\\n\\nThe idea of \\\"hope\\\" plays over and over in this film like a broken record.  Like a violent Shakespearean tragedy only without the fascinating plot\\, important characters are killed off (arbitrarily!): Ackbar\\, Luke\\, Snoke.  Hell\\, nearly the entire resistance is massacred.  To make matters more depressing\\, no rebel allies apart from Luke come to aid Leia at her most desperate hour.  Pathetically\\, the film's only escape from utter bleakness (a bleakness even deeper than Episode 5) comes anticlimactically at its end in the form of a random child who can grab a broom with a force.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, this hollow film fails to deliver on the suspense established by its predecessor.  Lacking good pacing and a compelling plot\\, it attempts to paint over these defects with cheap jokes and bold visuals.  Johnson marketed this manure as beef tartare and critics are gobbling it up in praise.  As a director\\, Johnson's a complete disgrace to the franchise\\, and I actually wish Lucas could return to pick up the pieces.  \\n\\nThe only pleasure I got from the film were the penguins.","true":true}
