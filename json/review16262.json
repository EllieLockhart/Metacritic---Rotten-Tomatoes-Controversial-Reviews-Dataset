Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not entirely sure what the haters are thinking. This movie is a very good Star Wars movie! Sure there were problems with pacing - and it felt a lot like the screenwriter KNEW that audiences were only there for the Luke\/Rey\/Kylo storyline\\, and so they said 'Okay watch all these other scenes to get back to that!'. I adore the additions of Rose Tico and Holdo\\, but I think the storyline on Canto Bight was too long for too little happening. However\\, the storyline between Rey and Kylo specifically was very well done! A nice call back to mythos originally seen in the first KotOR game surrounding the idea of a Force Bond\\, as well as something unique and intriguing in and of itself! Adam Driver continues to be absolutely compelling as Kylo Ren\\, and Daisy absolutely charming and relateable as Rey. Speaking of - I think the twists and turns with Rey and Kylo\\, namely the reveal of her parents and his betrayal of Snoke was wonderful! Fans will surely be divided about Kylo's eventual choice as well as the fate of Luke\\, but in my part\\, the story felt satisfying even if the pacing was a little slow at times. I'm anxiously awaiting episode IX and hope to see that Rey's faith in Ben (aka 'our only hope now') is well placed for his redemption!","true":true}
