Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the critics\\, I don't know how Disney do it but they know how to get the reviews they want. This film makes poor attempts at humor\\, virtually all the characters spin their wheels on ultimately unfruitful endeavors. Rey continues her assent in the force\\, without training. Also if the rest of the galaxy knew how idiotic the first order was they'd be overthrown in an instant. Oh & Leia also seems to have developed her own Mary Poppins ability in the force that handily manifests it's self at the most convenient of times.","true":true}
