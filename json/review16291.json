Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not mad\\, just disappointed. The Last Jedi doubles down on The Force Awakens' forced humor\\, shallow characters\\, and lack of believable world building. Things happen because the plot demands it without anything making sense given the series' previous events. \\\"Let the past die; kill it if you have to.\\\" Disney and writer\/director Rian Johnson take this quote a bit too far and have thus killed this fan's enthusiasm for any future Star Wars media. Adam Driver (who really is the saving grace of this new trilogy) and Mark Hamill are the only reasons to watch this travesty. \\n\\nP.S. I am a real person\\, not a troll or Russian bot. Just a baffled fan.","true":true}
