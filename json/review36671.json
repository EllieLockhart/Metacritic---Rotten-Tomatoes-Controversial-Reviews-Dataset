Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is not just a bad Star Wars film\\, but a bad film in general.  There were  a lot of plot holes\\, contradictions within the film\\, and even contradictions with previous Star Wars films.  Pointless story arcs\\, no character development\\, the plot was flimsy at best\\, cheap humor at the expense of tension and dramatic effect of the film\\, and characters which behave completely differently from previous films with out a believable reason for it.  It was just weak\\, and not worth spending your time and money to see.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.  The only positive points were the special effects and musical score.  At the core\\, it was just poorly written\\, and bad story telling.","true":true}
