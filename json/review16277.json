Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to say that this movie was bad\\, just that it didn't meet my expectations as far as the plot and story.  I didn't care for the manner of Luke's death\\, and I didn't like his attitude for most of the film.  I also expected more from the Snoke character.\\nAgain\\, this wasn't a bad movie\\, it just could have been a lot better.","true":true}
