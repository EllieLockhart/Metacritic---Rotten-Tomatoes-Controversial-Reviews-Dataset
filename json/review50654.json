Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"58% ??!!!I just came back from watching it and thought it was good. Sure it had some problems but not a 58%. I think there\u2019s a bunch of trolls that got offended by the comments about weapons in the film. This movie is way better then Justice League and that has a better score Then the Last Jedi .
