Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker is subject to such devastating character assassination in this film that it's hard to watch if you hold Star Wars dear to your heart. This\\, in addition to the underwhelming plot\\, erratic tone\\, rushed and poorly executed scenes\\, and many plot holes results in a terrible disappointment for Star Wars fans. The Last Jedi completely missed the point of Star Wars\\, and is easily the worst film of the franchise to date. The only positive is that both Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher-along with the rest of the cast-deliver wonderful performances\\, so long as you don't care whether or not the characters they're portraying are recognizable as the heroes of Star Wars\\, because they quite frankly are not. This film fails as a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
