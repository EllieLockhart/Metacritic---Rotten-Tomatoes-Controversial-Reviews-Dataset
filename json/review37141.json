Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only problem comes with the Finn and Rose subplot\\, which creates serious pacing issues. Everything beyond that is great\\, but it's a love it or hate it kind of deal\\, evidently. The negative reactions are pretty ironic when you take into account the main theme of this movie and the negative reactions to The Force Awakens.","true":true}
