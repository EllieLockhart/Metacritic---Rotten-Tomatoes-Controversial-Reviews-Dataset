Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely shocking...... What have you done Rian Johnson.... Terrible! Storylines that lead nowhere.... CGI fluff- did you not learn from lucus's mistakes in 1\\,2&3?? Too much stupid comedy and unwelcome characters. The rebels are basically get chased on a ship in slow motion  for 2hrs while other side stories lead nowhere\\, what a waste of time that could've been used in so many different \\nways with more depth of storylines for the \\nmain characters. What was the point in snoke.......? Snow foxes??? I mean wtf","true":true}
