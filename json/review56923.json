Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars movie I\u2019ve always wanted. I liked the Force Awakens even though it was pretty much just fan service. TLJ took everyone\u2019s expectations and threw them in the trash. Which is exactly why I loved it. Tired of hearing a bunch of grown men say their childhood is ruined. Get over it. This movie took some awesome chances and they paid off. ","true":true}
