Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been fortunate enough to see each Star Wars movie as it came out in the theater.   I  love these movies.  The Last Jedi is surprising creative touching funny exciting and imaginative.  High expectations met. Jaw dropped a few times then smiled or cried.  Will be going to theater again.","true":true}
