Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lets get one thing straight.  This movie is worth seeing in theaters.\\n\\nFor the surprisingly small amounts of epic\/intense moments there was one that made the whole experience worthwhile although there were very many problems I had with this movie.  It ended up feeling more like spaceballs than the epic we know of as the Star Wars Saga.  This movie is filled with sad attempts to get out a laugh and seemingly untouchable characters.  There were several moments where there was an intense build up to a characters death and then SWOOSH something magically saves the day\\, leaving the light side nearly unscathed.  A couple of moments that seemed to have been built up got out laughs in the theater when I think it was meant to be serious.  overall\\, a disappointing experience.","true":true}
