Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing TFA\\, a recycled new hope\\, my expectations coming in were already low. After decades of fans waiting for Luke\u2019s return\\, It was a total failure around Disney to not do more with him in this movie. Somehow\\, which is not surprising\\, the story loses focus with what was suppose to built around Episode 7. I gave it 1.5 stars just because they brought back puppet Yoda. ","true":true}
