Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see the Last Jedi on December 14\\, 2017. I left the movie very disappointed. The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie ever.  The story is bad\\, has plot holes everywhere. It treats characters like Luke Skywalker in a very disrespectful way.  The scene in Canto Bight is boring and useless (makes no sense). I could keep going on\\, but many reviews have gone into details already. \\nJJ Abrams and  Lawrence Kasdan on The Force Awakens screenplay had given Director Rian Johnson the opportunity to pick up on so many interesting stories and characters; which Rian Johnson tossed to the garbage or just did not mention at all. I think that Rian Johnson should not be allowed to do another Star Wars movie\\, because I think he does not understand what Star Wars is all about.\\nI wish that the Last Jedi could be taken out of the Star Wars canon and be remake. But since I think that will not be done by Disney. I just hope that J.J. Abrams does a good job on Episode 9 and fix this mess that Rian Johnson created.","true":true}
