Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am usually silent\\, with my opinions but I also a hardcore star wars fan. I will say this Disney\\, Im the guy that helps you get to your billion because i will watch the move 4 or 5 times in the theater. I buy the toys posters different versions of the movie. You have lost my wallet good luck.","true":true}
