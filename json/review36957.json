Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was not just underwhelming but boring. The plot is poorly laid out and there is a whole arc which has no purpose. The actions of characters in power also make no sense. It seems that the people are aware they are in a movie and it shows. \\nThat said the movie is beautiful. One of the best visual movie of the year\\, but I came for a story\\, not shiny colors.","true":true}
