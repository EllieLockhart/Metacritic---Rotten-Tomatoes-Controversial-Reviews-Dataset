{"101487":175819,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was bad because of the following reasons: awkward storytelling\\, being a 2-hour movie about a breaking down spaceship which is out of a never heard of before space fuel\\, a cringe-worthy series of scenes in a space casino with really stupid caricatures of wealthy folk which all ended with an alien PETA commercial\\, a bunch of non-answers about character origin\\, the campy-Avenger-like \\\"jokes\\\" every ten seconds\\, the bad writing for Luke\\, the Smeagal-rip-off looking Snoke\\, the awful character Rose (Oh Lord have mercy she was awful\\, her sister was pretty boss though).  Or that Luke does something awesome at the end\\, and makes you think that him and kilo will have some epic fight in the next movie\\, but then he just disappeared! This movie sucked balls","true":true}
