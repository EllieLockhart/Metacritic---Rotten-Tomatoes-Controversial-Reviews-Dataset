Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I at first wanted to like this movie at least some despite it not living up the critics acclaim... but then as I had time to process what I saw I grew to despise this movie.  It is the worst in the franchise and makes me hesitant to watch more of the series I'm sad to say.  So much is wrong in this film.\\n\\nTotally butchers Luke.  He's completely out of character.\\n\\nPlot holes.  Plot holes.  Plot holes.\\n\\nSJW nonsense.\\n\\nMary Sue!\\n\\nCraps on previous film's build up.\\n\\nUgg I hate to even mention more it just makes me feel bad thinking about this film that I really wanted to love.","true":true}
