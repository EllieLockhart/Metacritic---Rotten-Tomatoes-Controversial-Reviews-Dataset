Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"100% Masterpiece. Can\u00b4t tell too much without saying spoilers\\, so I will be specific\\, this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever made\\, mind blowing and twisted. Rian Johnson did a sequel with a lot of risky plots that at the end result positive\\, and took the main characters to a lot different paths that we didn\u00b4t expected it. A+","true":true}
