Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson had every opportunity to make an excellent movie.  Instead\\, he and Disney delivered a campy\\, goofy\\, and just bizarre train wreck that doesn't do any justice to the characters or overall saga.  The pacing seems like it was determined by an 8 year old with ADHD\\, none of the major sequences had any real gravitas and instead are peppered with cheap slapstick humor\\, and worst of all\\, the film does no justice to the great characters that previous movies created.  The whole thing just seemed like a cheap\\, farcical knockoff.  There is no quality here.  Utterly disappointed.\\nFurthermore\\, I'm utterly bewildered at how such an obvious pile of BS could reach a 93% fresh rating here with critics\\, but a thoroughly rotten rating from users.  Is Disney paying off critics for good reviews?  Something is fishy here...","true":true}
