Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please tell me we get a new writer\/director for next episode. I cannot imagine how the critics can put this anywhere near the top of Star Wars movies. I have it 6\/9 myself. Better than episode 1\\,2 and rogue one. That\u2019s it.","true":true}
