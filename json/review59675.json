The issues however are many and I will try to explain.\r\rGraphics: yes they seem nice especially the outside visuals of landscapes but faces at times seem utterly weird and not in keeping with the rest of the game. When I see people say the graphics are 10\/10 i just laugh because there are some really poor ones.\r\rGameplay: It is I am afraid to say quite dated in the way it works but the worst thing is the jump system which seems to fail for no reason and they even include a easy jump version in the controls. This should tell you that they knew it was bad but decided to do nothing about that.\rThe game had some very boring parts in my humble opinion and just seemed to be there to stretch the game out.\r\rSound: Very nice and I cant say too much negative about it\r\rAll in all not a bad game but a disappointment none the less\\, If ND wanted to make a political statement they should have done so via twitter because some of this stuff does not need to be in games. Woke culture is bleeding into too much stuff these days. The way ND and Sony handled the leak was terrible but that does not effect my score at all.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
