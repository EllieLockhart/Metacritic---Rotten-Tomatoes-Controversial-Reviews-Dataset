Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't remember any previous highly anticipated movie leave me thinking\\, \\\"What the ****\\\" after only the first 20 minutes. For anyone that is a real fan\\, definitely steer clear\\, it's actually heart breaking how the movie destroys characters we once loved by blatently acting out of character. Did the director even watch the previous movies?\\n\\nI was actually embarrassed of the Star Wars name after this movie\\, without exaggeration not one person left the theatre with a smile. Some were confused\\, others hurt others still angry. Granted it  was a late showing and only 2\/3rds full but still\\, not a single happy face. A quiet walk more suited for a wake to the parking lot. No laughing and excited kids\\, or yells of \\\"I can't wait for the next one!!!\\\". I actually have lost interest in Star Wars and don't care how it ends. It ended in a way where there is no real conflict left. The protagonist is invincible and the antagonist is weak and a fool.\\n\\nHorrible horrible movie. Heart breaking. 1\/3 of the story was not even needed as it was useless and didn'tt advance the story... it had a feel that the director and studio were trying to push an agenda on the audience.\\n\\nSeriously. Wow. It was a horrible movie. Sorry.","true":true}
