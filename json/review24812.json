Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My 1-star rating was only for the visuals. The rest of the movie was trash. I left the movie feeling heartbroken. It would have been perfectly okay to kill off Luke; but\\, like with Han\\, they did it without respecting the character. Why\\, Disney? Why?","true":true}
