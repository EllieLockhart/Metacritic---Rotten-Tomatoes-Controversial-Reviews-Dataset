Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the opposite of TFA. In TFA it was basically a remake of A New Hope\\, in TLJ\\, too many things are different. Things are changed and risks are taken just for the sake of it. From the force powers to the personalities of the actors to the plot points. I really liked TFA and thought it was done well even though it was obvious it was a reskin of A New Hope. But this mess\\, and it is a mess\\, is just all over the place. It's so divisive in its direction and pacing. Scenes constantly go back and forth. It's as if it were made specifically for ADD millennials... They've ruined Luke and made him a joke. The moral of the story is anyone can be special and that's a great message but we got that from the original trilogy. We got that from A New Hope. Seems like Disney is trying to put their stamp on it recklessly\\, represented by the scene at the end with the little boy. No wonder everyone coming out of the previous showings didn't look happy.","true":true}
