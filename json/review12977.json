Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't believe Rian Johnson understands Star Wars.  He might have just watched the previous films prior to writing this episode and wen't for surprises instead of logical story telling.  In the process\\, he destroyed Star Wars with this ridiculous film.  Young Star Wars fans might not see it\\, but if you grew up with the originals\\, you will hate this film.  2 of the prequels were bad films\\, but atleast they didn't destroy Star Wars canon.  This film destroys\/damages the canon\\, which is an unforgivable\/irredeemable mistake.","true":true}
