{"101487":170283,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is written and directed by Rian Johnson. It is the second film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy\\, following Star Wars: The Force Awakens where the movie left off.  The movie stars Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, John Boyega\\, Oscar Isaac\\, Andy Serkis\\, Lupita Nyong'o\\, Domhnall Gleeson\\, Anthony Daniels\\, and Gwendoline Christie in returning roles\\, with Kelly Marie Tran\\, Laura Dern\\, and Benicio del Toro joining the cast. \\n\\nTo be honest I have a love and hate relationship with the Star Wars franchise. Equally\\, I love Star Wars (New Hope) and The Empire Atrikes Back\\, but over the years I find it difficult for the franchise struggling on it's brand of originality. With Return of the Jedi and was George Lucas's involvement and the original cast. I find it complex to believe that they were not taking a risk. Because of my perspective I find Star Wars for a franchise being a risk taker and as I find Return of the Jedi for market line of toys. Same with the Prequel's and The Force Awakens. \\n\\nWith Force Awakens in 2015\\, I was very happy that they gotten JJ Abrams directing and writing the film. But with the outcome of the first movie of the new sequel trilogy... I find it to be good\\, but not taking chances but making it safe for this new start. Just in  two years of thinking over of what I think of Disney and Star Wars. For Disney being humble to its fans of welcoming a new chapter in the saga and giving its audience a safe story because of the prequel's that George Lucas was in charge of. I believe it is a good move but it was not settled for me. I do think that the Force Awakens is a good Star Wars film but it was not Star Wars film. It's just felt like an average action sci-fi film. But today on December 15\\, 2017\\, this love-hate relationship with Star Wars is brightening because of Rian Johnson. \\n\\nEven though that we live in this day amd age of reporters and journalism getting to know the facts behind the curtain of Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, even for Mark Hamill disagreeing with everything that Rian Johnson wrote on paper for this film. Not agreeing with anything by what his character does. But protecting his character that he cherish throughout his acting career\\, but in my mind. Deep down I really want Luke Skywalker as this Yoda and Odi-Wan like character that I've seen in this movie. Giving us the man that was heroic titan when we last saw him. Now he abanded his world as an outcast and blame his faults on to himself. Seeing a stranded man contemplated from his faults. (\\\"It's time for the Jedi\\, to end!\\\") showing for the time to end and for a bright new beginning\\n\\nDaisy Ridley as Ray as this ambitious woman that we first met in Force Awakens blossomed in this movie. Really blossomed and seeing the world that surrounded by her into darkness and hatred in both sides of the force and people. Again\\, Rian Johnson wrote Daisy Ridleys character very open to what she has awakened to. (\\\"I want someone\\, to show me my place.\\\") finding a place and finding an answer to her new world. \\n\\nAdam Driver as Kylo Ren\\, I have no problems as him as the antagonist. And with Adam Driver's character is more fleshed out because it was better written for him. Giving him a conflict of what good and bad and what side you should stay on. Being conflicted by his master's and hoss doing's (\\\"Let the past die\\, kill it!\\\"). Kylo Ren or Ben Solo is so compelling and very comparable to Darth Vader. \\n\\nCarrie Fisher's last performance as princess Leia it's very heartbreaking to see in this film. As it doesn't feel like Heath Ledger's death before The Dark Knight. But which gotten to know Carrie fisher as Princess Leia for 40 years. But as for Carrie Fisher's last performance in a film ever\\, I believe that everybody will be rejoiceful by what she did in this performance. As a character perspective\\, Princess Leia has seen a lot of shit\\, her home planet Alderon being blown up in front of her\\, death in every corner\\, saying love ones departed. With Rian Johnson and Carrie Fisher working together on what Leia should be presented in this film is great. Her motivation as this wiser character\\, she saying innocence and love ones dying but leaders leadding in the wrong way (\\\"Losing warriors\\, not leaders!\\\"). Rest In Peace Carrie Fisher you will be missed. \\n\\nAs for the side characters I have no problem with\\, but In a way it's slips away the driver of the film. Oscar Isaac as Poe Damron is really really good in this film I love Poe Damron in this for more than the Force Awakens. We get more of him. John Boyega as Fin is not a game changer in my eyes. Fin just wake up in his comma and has a hard on for Ray and seeks her out\\, and then we get this this story that was good for the sorry later on\\, but not really intentional. Like I'm just gonna say it I'm not a huge fan of Fin. I just believe that he is a character filler. It's a shame really because I really like John Boyega as an actor. It flows really well with the story but it was just too much for the story. I love when I move it takes of risk and Rian Johnson did\\, but if its necessary\\, put it in. If not\\, DONT!! But then again\\, this is not the Skywalker films that we are used to seeing. We are finally heading territories that are not rhymed with the Star Wars saga. \\n\\nAs for Kelly Marie Tran\\, Laura Dern\\, and Benicio del Toro joining the cast\\, I find it not game changing at all\\, to me it was just fillers. Kelly Marie I find really good in the film. I love the  introduction to her character being good partners with Fin. But I find it not really intentional to be in the film\\, not even being memorable. Is it really going to film? I don't know! I believe that you will get what I'm saying once you see this film. I'm trying to keep this review spoiler free as possible. \\n\\nThe only flaws I have a film is the character structures of the new side characters and the previous ones in the first film. But I do believe that the film is labyrinth with magnificent moments. Honoring Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki films. Especially honoring Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford films. Everyone keeps forgetting that Star Wars was built and engineered by a film lover. That name was and is George Lucas. \\n\\nThis film is beautiful to look at\\, the feel and the cinematography of this film felt like it was not for us but behave more welcomed to this universe and to this film. I love the 70mm wide shots that Rian Johnson put in this film. Sure JJ Abrams use the same lenses from new hope\\, but didn't really feel like a Star Wars film? Ryan and Johnson knew what he wanted with the lenses and the direction of the camera that he wants with this film and it was beautiful simply beautiful and just amazing to look at. This is a well directed Star Wars film at my opinion. If you're that guy that is really into filmmaking like me\\, you will rejoice!! \\n\\nRian Johnson has a unique voice for his script writing. He created worlds that we can even imagine before he came to the galaxy far far away. From Looper and Brick\\, two of my favorite films of all time. When I heard in 2015 that he will be taking over this saga\\, i've said it before and I'll say it again. We are going to be blown away until episode eight comes. This film is beautiful\\, breathtakingly beautiful. Metaphorically brilliant\\, bringing the characters in the new stages that we never seen these characters ever before. And breaking the cycle\\, that's right.. The cycle has finally broken. I was getting tired of these repeats and repertoire of this whole saga. Sure we did get some rhymes borrowed from the saga and using these rhymes into good use into this film. But repeating that sing that we seen before was not insight in this film at all. This will be a game changer to all the fans of this franchise. Everybody will not like it maybe even hate it. But I'm just going to ignore that because I gave my love back to the franchise are used to grow up with. \\n\\nI believe in 1977 when they first seen Star Wars it was an eye-opener\\, and even when they saw Empire Strikes back. It happened again. 2017 The Last Jedi\\, we finally got the Star Wars that we wanted to have for very long time. A game changer\\, I film to love and cherish. I believe when I have kids\\, and when they have kids. They will see in time that this film is miraculous to the old and the new. \\n\\nI am going to give the same grade that I gave for the Force Awakens. Because of the character structure that happen in the middle of the film\\, slowing down the narrative structure of the film. But I truly think that Rian Johnson's ambitious writing for Star Wars is what I wanted to see for very long time that I never seen\\, but finally getting to see it\\, my dreams come true. If you're in the same crowd as me\\, this is the film. Go see it!! \\n\\nGrade: 9\/10","true":true}
