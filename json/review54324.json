Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a star wars fanatic ever since my dad showed me them. I loved all of the movies thus far\\, some more then others but loved them all the same. Now that I have set the context of my fandom. I want to be frank\\, i made an account just to write this. Words do not describe my disappointment in this film. I would of been able to accept all of the story direction even though its not what i wanted. If the movie itself wasnt a train wreck of a movie. Its not thay its a \\\"bad star wars\\\" so much that it is a terrible movie. No amount of fandom can buy you leniency for this horrible addition to the saga.","true":true}
