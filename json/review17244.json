Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really really really wanted to like this movie\\, and left the theater feeling confused and empty. After digesting what I saw\\, I had to wonder if Rian Johnson ever really liked Star Wars. This movie actually betrayed so much of what I loved about Star Wars. TLJ does a great job creating the Star Wars universe\\, it fits. But Luke\\, and other characters we cared about\\, were purposefully subverted... for the sake of subverting\\, not for making a more meaningful movie. Luke flat out deserved a better\\, more meaningful\\, more heroic ending. The fans deserve better than this. While I get a movie can't make everyone happy\\, new  SW has got to appear to the younger generation\\, which might explain humor this is painfully out of place for Star Wars\\, along with the annoying social commentary that was an obviously more important than a good story. All in all\\, this is how an Star Wars is ruined as a franchise. Disney Rian Johnson'd it. So sad.","true":true}
