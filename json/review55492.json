{"101487":155130,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest fear after seeing \\\"The Last Jedi\\,\\\" is that it paves the way for future SW films to get away with cheap\\, plot hole mired storytelling\\, with a strong indifference\\, and almost disdain\\, for the legacy established by the title it bears. Not only are tropes established in the original trilogy thrown violently out the window (which I do not mind)\\, but subplots established in \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" TLJ's immediate predecessor\\, are also hastily disregarded\\, leaving anyone who expected some degree of continuity between the two a little puzzled. Afterall\\, are we not viewing a sequel to episode VII\\, and one which is part of a larger trilogy? Episode VIII hits the reset button in a way I would expect an initial installment to do so\\, and in some ways\\, it is so self-contained\\, I would prefer to hand out a flashcard to any first time viewer of the new trilogy with the relevant takeaways from episode VII\\, so as not to confuse them with back-to-back screenings of the two. If there is one feeling TLJ tries to recapture from the original trilogy\\, it is the sense of surprise from major twists\\, a la episode V. Sadly\\, this film tries to dial the \\\"twist\\\" factor up to about 10\\, to the point where they simply feel trite. I do not mind risk taking\\, nor do I mind the notion of fresh storytelling\\, so long as they're carried out in a structured and coherent manner; something which TLJ fails to do.","true":true}
