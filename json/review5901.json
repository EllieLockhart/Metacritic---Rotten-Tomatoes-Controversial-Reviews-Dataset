Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Had a huge opportunity here but missed the mark. The framework of the story is intriguing but the delivery and some of the decisions made are very mind-boggling. The Leia floating in space scene may be the single worst Star Wars scene ever filmed including anything involving Jar Jar Binks. It looked like a cheap knockoff of a Marvel Superheroes movie not Star Wars. And killing snoke without ever making him really matter makes no sense. I mean why? And then just phasing-out Luke very questionable. Where is this story heading? There's no momentum and seemingly no Direction heading into episode 9. I understand it Star Wars needs to break with the past a little bit and head into something new but I'm not sure this was the right way to do it. In fact I'm almost certain it was not.","true":true}
