Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really want to know why so many critics liked this. Did they see a different version? I love sci-fi\\, fantasy\\, action\\, adventure\\, comic book\\, and hero movies. This movie had one great scene (and it didn't have any sound or actors).","true":true}
