Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie that takes a s**t on the fans\\, and then tells the fans they are wrong. Hack movie\\, Hack writing\\, hack job to establish characters\\, lack of character development for the new characters\\, story arks ended at pointless times that destroy the overall story. ~30 minutes of the movie spent to show something that could have been done in 5 min\\, when that time could have been spent developing Rey's story. just to name a few of the problems.","true":true}
