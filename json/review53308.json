Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Continuity. This the major issue with this film. If this film was anything other than a \u201cStar Wars\u201d film it wouldn\u2019t be that bad of a film (at least as good as a \u201cTransfomers\u201d movie). But the problem is that the film is supposed to be the eighth in a series. It completely disregards the lore\\, history and legacy of the seven films that came before it. Most notably the one right before it! It\u2019s as if Rian Johnson had never seen a Star Wars movie\\, and that JJ Abrams had only given him the names of the characters\\, and that it was set in space. It is not \u201c fan service\u201d to ask for a film that has some kind of basis\\, in the universe that the previous films have established. This film isn\u2019t taking Star Wars in a new direction but is rather a blatant\\, disrespectful abandonment of its predecessors. The film reveals its intent when Kylo Ren says\\, \u201cLet the past die\\, kill if you have to\u201d. This is why we hate this film.... killing the past isn\u2019t how you move forward. We are all the sum total of our experiences\\, our past is what makes us who we are\\, for better or worse. It\u2019s how we learn and what makes us stronger. Forgetting your past\\, dooms you to repeat your mistakes. If Disney doesn\u2019t start embracing the films that came before it\\, they will never progress. They will never expand the Star Wars universe. A universe ripe with possibility and adventure... And that\u2019s what we all really want. ","true":true}
