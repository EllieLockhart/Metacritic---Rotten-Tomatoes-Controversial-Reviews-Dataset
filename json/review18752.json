Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a good movie\\, but a bad starwars film.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker looks as a grumpy old hermit\\, stuck in the past\\, and for a 40 years jedi not wise at all. As character\\, very disappointed development\\, throwing away his fathers lightsaber\\, considering the murder of his nephew... weak jedi in a duel with his apprendice. \\n\\nClassic characters in the mithology are not developed and the movie itself treats it's heritage like the Luke' Jedi texts\\, something to be burned as nothing important or to be respect of.\\n\\nEvery single unanswered question from The Force Awakens has been answered or deemed unimportant\\, thrown aside like the lightsabre handed to Luke\\, a very emotional scene at the end of The Force Awakens\\, reduced to a gag.\\n\\nThe Canto Bight foray and story line was painful\\, and could be cut out of the entire movie\\, with no change to the plot at all.","true":true}
