Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the haters\\, this was a galaxy changing installment! Things evolve- this catapulted the narrative forward; no one knew Carrie would pass away so they had big plans for her next time. They planted the seeds for more revelations in the future. Like long Star Wars fanatic here- I\u2019m happy they\u2019re breathing new life into Jedi lore. Haters and insult slingers need to write their own fan fiction if they think they\u2019ve got the corner market on the intellectual property. It was a freaking fun movie.","true":true}
