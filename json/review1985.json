Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A solid movie that could have been great. I liked the first half more than the second half. I liked how Luke's character has changed and they didn't just do fan service\\, but I didn't buy how his character didn't evolve a lot throughout the film. That was my only major issue. Adam Driver is absolutely amazing and steals the show. His best performance to date. Ridley is better here than in Force Awakens in my opinion and I didn't mind the Canto Bight subplot. I liked how Johnson did something different and think the film is way over criticized but I understand that it could have been better. Still\\, this is my second favorite film of the new Star Wars so far just behind Rogue One.","true":true}
