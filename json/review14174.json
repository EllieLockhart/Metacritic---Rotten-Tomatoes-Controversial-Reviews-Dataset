Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you would enjoy seeing a Jedi milk an alien a Princess fly through space like Mary Poppins\\, a cringe-worthy series of attempted jokes... no character development - the only formidable bad-guy killed with no explanation of his origins and then you'll love this! Way to go Rian Johnson and Disney! You did something impossibly difficult! You made Star Wars suck!","true":true}
