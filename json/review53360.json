{"101487":115277,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-30","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroyed everything TFA set up. Tons of plot holes and things that just didn\u2019t make any sense. Rian Johnson looks as though he didn\u2019t even watch TFA or study how a Star Wars film is supposed to be made. There\u2019s a reason the studio and director are coming out to defend the film; it\u2019s awful. It doesn\u2019t feel like the second part of a trilogy. SPOILERS: There\u2019s way more wrong with this film than just Leia\u2019s spacewalk or the way they treat Luke. The main Resistance ship running out of fuel is stupid\\, but even so\\, they used up the fuel to slowly run away\\, then used it again to fuel the transports\\, then Laura Dern used it again to jump to light speed. Why didn\u2019t Laura Dern tell Poe of the plan\\, even when he started a mutiny? He couldn\u2019t ruined the entire plan. Why did Poe\/Finn call Maz? Does Poe even know Maz? Finn met her for about 5 minutes. Why didn\u2019t Maz just tell them the name of the codebreaker? Why did Rose stop Finn from deserting? Doesn\u2019t the Resistance have more to worry about than deserters? Does the Resistance punish deserters? The Rebellion didn\u2019t. The casino planet was worthless. They free animals that will get caught again\\, instead of taking some of the kids with them. The plan ultimately fails anyway. How did the codebreaker know the Resistance were using shuttle transports to flee? As far as he knew the plan was to get back to the ship and jump to light speed. The plan wasn\u2019t revealed until after they were caught already. Finn sorta beats Phasma\\, but they were gonna die anyway because of the explosion\\, so the entire subplot was useless. There\u2019s a big deal about not being a big hero\\, but that\u2019s exactly what Laura Dern does in sacrificing herself. Rose saving Finn from sacrificing himself was dumb\\, because she had no idea Luke was coming back. So by saving him\\, she doomed the Resistance. Why didn\u2019t Luke just tell everyone he was making a distraction? What if they never figured out what he was doing? Why didn\u2019t the Millenium Falcon just blow up the cannon? If those small ships could then the Falcon certainly could. Rose and Finn having a romantic interest in one another was really forced. Everyone is exactly where they were at the end of TFA\\, except maybe Kylo Ren. There\u2019s really not much to look forward to in Episode IX. In short\\, it\u2019s one of the worst Star Wars films ever made.","true":true}
