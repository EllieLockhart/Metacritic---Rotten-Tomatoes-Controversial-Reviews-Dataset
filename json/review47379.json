Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say to add to this conversation? Firstly I want to say that I didn't have any fan theories going into this film\\, so that argument against those who dislike the film is invalid in my case. I've watched it a few times now and have thought a lot about it. I am a fan of Star Wars\\, but not a fanboy (am a big time Trek fan)\\, but I love the original trilogy and The Force Awakens\\, but this really was a disappointing movie. In an attempt to subvert the expectations of the audience the director manages to have no \\\"payoff\\\" from anything that was set up in The Force Awakens\\, or for things that were set up in THIS movie. You read that right. This movie doesn't even pay off itself. It also doesn't set anything up for the next movie. All we can look forward to are characters who are mostly the same as they were before this movie began\\, and a hope that Luke Skywalker makes an appearance as a force ghost to do something epic. I find the path and the story of the current characters very superficial and uninteresting. I do not feel the same way as I did at the end of The Force Awakens where I was excited and looking forward to the next movie. There are multiple plots going along at the same time and really only the Rey and Luke plot was interesting to me. Much of what happens seems like filler and has little consequence on the plot. There were also some heavy-handed political messages\\, which distracted from the film experience for me\\, mainly because they weren't done well. I think this movie also suffers with re-watchability. After seeing The Force Awakens\\, there were several scenes I looked forward to watching at home on my TV\\, but with The Last Jedi\\, I am struggling to think of a scene I want to see again. Maybe the Luke\/R2 scene\\, Luke\/Yoda\\, or maybe the throne room battle. I guess I could just look those scenes up on YouTube and save myself 2.5 hours. I'm not ranking this movie low because I'm an upset fanboy\\, it just wasn't a very good movie. Aside from any Star Wars related missteps\\, which there are several\\, a movie that barely rolls along with lack-luster characters and no payoff from the beginning to the end\\, it just isn't a good movie. I am giving it a star and a half for good visuals and a few scenes that were done well.","true":true}
