Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rife with plot holes\\, poor character development\\, forced humor\\, and a disappointing version of Luke Skywalker. This was probably the worst of the series. Visually stunning as usual and Kylo Ren intrigues the audience enough to keep you from walking out in disgust. ","true":true}
