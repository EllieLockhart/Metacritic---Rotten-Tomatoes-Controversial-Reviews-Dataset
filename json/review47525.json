Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What poor storytelling. None of the plot points from the first instalment were elaborated on\\, which was very disappointing. Its like it was written by a different person - oh wait it was.... Pacing was terrible\\, and the story just did not flow. The humour seemed forced\\,  corny and out of place in the star wars universe. My biggest problem is that there was no character development from the previous movie\\, and that there were major holes in the plot. New characters were introduced but they were not interesting at all. I remember thinking during the film that the final act could redeem the film (i was being hopeful)\\, but alas it was a big let down as well. All in all a major disappointment. Some of the visuals were impressive though. Still amazed that disney would release something with such a poor plot.","true":true}
