Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, kills the feeling on 2015 movie\\, just another movie for weekend\\, I don\u00b4t remember epic dialogues\\, action o battle\\, it\u00b4s like  Frozen Short Film before Coco\\, before the real movie Episode IX","true":true}
