Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not my Luke Skywalker. No consistency between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. It\u2019s as if both directors wanted to do their own thing at the expense of the story and characters. Too many plot holes and pointless adventures for Characters just to get them in the movie. If you are looking for any answers to questions from TFA don\u2019t set your expectations too high. Good Luck to JJ On Ep 9 Rian Johnson handed you a hot potato. ","true":true}
