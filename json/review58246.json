Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"75% of this movie was canto filler and uninteresting\\, one-dimensional characters. The 25% of it\\, however\\, is filled with spectacular CGI and great character chemistry. \\n\\nThe movie's almost a balance itself. Dull galactic battles and shootouts are contrasted with lightsaber face-offs and the \\\"flash slashing\\\" of the First Order ship. The wrinkly\\, CGI Andy Serkis - I mean Snoke - is paired with the much evolved Kylo Ren. The pointless detour to the casino runs along with Rey and Luke's conversations on the island. Finn and Rose's bland interactions are booted under Rey and Kylo's mesmerizing\\, near-perfect chemistry.\\n\\nHonestly\\, it's easy to see why everyone is so divided between this movie. However\\, that epic teamup of Rey and Kylo in Snoke's throne room tipped me to the more positive side. Much more satisfactory than TFA.","true":true}
