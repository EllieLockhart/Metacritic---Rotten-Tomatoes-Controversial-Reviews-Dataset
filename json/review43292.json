Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a film that did't live up to its expectations\\, didn't fulfill the set ups of the Force Awakens\\, and didn't honor the legacy of the original film characters. The villains were cartoonishly juvenile and naive\\, and the social politics were front and center to the detriment of the story.The visual effects were good and so was the music score.","true":true}
