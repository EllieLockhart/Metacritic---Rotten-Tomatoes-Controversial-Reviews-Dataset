If my English is incorrect\\, it's because I'm not English.You have to try the game.  You can explore and see things that don't appear on gameplay videos if one doesn't explore.

The ending is something spectacular if you think about it.  Haters cry because the stark reality of how life really is.

There is too much to say to dismantle the haters but not being able to express myself better because I cannot speak English well I stop here.  look for foreign reviews and translate it is worth it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
