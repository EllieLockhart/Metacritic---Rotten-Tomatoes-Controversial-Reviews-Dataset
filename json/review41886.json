Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is total garbage\\,from snoke being nothing\\,superman leia in space\\,turning luke into a wuss and ruining his character\\,rey with no training looking like a jedi master\\,and kylo being the worst bad guy ever.Then on top of that the first order is waiting on the resistance to run out of fuel\\,just garbage","true":true}
