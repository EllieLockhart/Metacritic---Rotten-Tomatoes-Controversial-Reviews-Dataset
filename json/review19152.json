Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"its just a boring movie\\, this movie feels more like a part 4 to the prequels then a part two to the force awakens. If your looking for answers to questions from the first movie apparently that's our fault for expecting to much. If your going to see it make sure its a matinee showing to save some money and I've never been a star wars fan the only one I liked was the last two so maybe this one wasn't ment for me ","true":true}
