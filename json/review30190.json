Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it and was a jumbled up mess.  The passion and lore of the Star Wars movies was lost after seeing this overly long P.C. snore.  Too many holes and nothing clicked.  Next film I'll wait till it comes out online.","true":true}
