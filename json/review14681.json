Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. The Last Jedi made my heart cry a little on the inside - not because of how moving it is\\, but for how terribly made it is. It's worse than most bad Star Wars fan fiction\\, and does nothing to serve the story\\, the characters are weak\\, and the decisions the writer made are so blah and disheartening. Ironically\\, many of the Transformers movies (as terrible as they can be) have more genuine emotion and better character development. It also felt badly edited and somehow a movie where next to nothing happens felt 4 hours long with many wasted scenes. We didn't need to see Luke fishing and milking a sea cow's te@t! This one is not only a bad Star Wars film\\, it's a  bad movie in general. 1 star.","true":true}
