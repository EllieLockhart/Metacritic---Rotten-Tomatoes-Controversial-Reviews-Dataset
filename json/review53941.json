Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually created an RT account just to I can review this film and give it half a star.  I've been a star wars fan since I was 6.  Luke was my hero\\,  When my friend asked me if I had high expectations for this film\\, I told him \\\"Not really\\, I just expect it to be good.  There is no way I can dislike a film that has Luke Skywalker in it.\\\"  Boy was I COMPLETELY WRONG.  The sad part about it was that I really really wanted to like it.  Ruining my childhood hero is simply unforgiveable.  There was no reason to do it.  Congratulations Rian Johnson\\, you've done something that I never thought would be possible.  You've completely soured me on the entire Star Wars franchise.  I'm actually selling all my toys now and I'm not going to spend another cent on any Star Wars film going forward.  I'm sticking with the MCU.","true":true}
