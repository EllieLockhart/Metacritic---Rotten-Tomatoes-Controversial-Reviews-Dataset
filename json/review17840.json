Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had its moments but it also left a gaping hole in my heart. You have to see it because it\u2019s Star Wars but you want it to be better than it is. It makes you happy JJ is coming back for the next one. I think anyone who says it\u2019s the best Star Wars movie yet is really wanting it to be more than it is but know in their hearts it\u2019s not even close. ","true":true}
