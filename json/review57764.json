Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very mixed feelings with this one. Completely torn. If you are a casual moviegoer\\, for the most part\\, you'll find The Last Jedi to be an entertaining movie. If you are a Star Wars fan..... you get the sense as the movie is unfolding that something is out of place. Something feels off. The pacing of the movie isn't Star Wars\\, for the most part the humor isn't Star Wars\\, the final scene- for the very first time in the Star Wars saga- unnecessarily and uncharacteristically steers completely away from our main characters\\, and most importantly The Last Jedi literally works to dismiss most of what The Force Awakens established and turns it upside down. Which isn't necessarily bad\\, but because this is part of a trilogy and not a standalone movie\\, by the end of this juggernaut we are left with very little to look forward to for Episode IX. The movie is beautiful\\, the cinematography is excellent\\, the last act is fresh and entertaining\\, but.... the pacing\\, story development\/character arcs bring down what could have been a great Star Wars movie. The potential was there. Execution... not so much.","true":true}
