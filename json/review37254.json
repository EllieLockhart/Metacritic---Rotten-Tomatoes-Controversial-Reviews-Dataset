Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people like me don't hate The Last Jedi because A) we hate everything or B) we don't like change or C) it was not what we expected. We hate it because it was poorly paced\\, poorly executed\\, cringe-inducing\\, and boring. Long stretches of the movie made no sense\\, or were poorly derivative.  You could drive the Millennium Falcon through the plot holes. Enough with the knee-jerk\\, automatic love of this movie.  Demand better from Walt Disney\\, and for God's sake get rid of Rian Johnson.","true":true}
