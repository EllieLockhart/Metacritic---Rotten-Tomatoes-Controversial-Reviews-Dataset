{"101487":163250,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty poor film\\, overly long and poor story\\, that's the sort of this review. SPOILERS AHEAD. Here's the reasons why:\\n\\nMost character's stories are not developed in anyway\\, for example Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi and for some reason Ben Solo is bad\\, so Luke thinks about killing him which leads to the destruction of the new Jedi. Why is Ben bad? It's not expanded on why he turns bad\\, we're just suppose to accept that people are born bad\\, and don't have reasons. This is stupid\\, even the greatest evils in the world like Hitler and Lucifer have a reason for being the evil they are\\, but Disney Star Wars doesn't want to waste time with developing character's background so you relate or understand them\\, it'd rather spend time showing you either slow burn Luke wont train Ray scenes or Finn and his new girl escaping ridiculous situations.\\n\\nThis then leads Luke to hate the Jedi and cut himself off from the force\\, which isn't explained why. The Jedi teachings didn't tell Luke to try kill Ben\\, it was a mistake made by Luke. So in his hatred for the Jedi he goes to live on the first Jedi temple. Right... It's like a god hating ex christian going to live in Vatican city\\, makes no sense. All this is out of character for Luke and is against everything we know about the character.\\n\\nSo we faf around with will he won't he train Ray\\, while she and Kylo Renn have a connection that ultimately leads nowhere. Whilst this is all going on she finds a dark side mirror\\, which after a cool looking scene does nothing to develop Ray's character.\\n\\nThe film teases all the way throughout about Ray's parents and ultimately we find out nothing about them\\, because Snoke was fucking with her and Kylo. And then we get to Snoke\\, who gets no back story of who he is\\, where he was whilst the Empire was around\\, why he is so strong with the dark side\\, why he's deformed\\, nothing. Just another big bad character Disney Star Wars throws at us with no explanation. Also this guy is slapping Ray around and making Kylo Renn look like a child\\, but is killed by Kylo and he can't see it coming... ok.\\n\\nI can't even be bothered to go into Leia having super Jedi powers all of a sudden\\, Finn's washy storyline or how dumb it is for Luke to die after his Force projection is stabbed.\\n\\nUltimately though the film ends and the Resistance and the First Order are left in the same place as they were at the end of Force Awakens\\, with a few soldiers dead on each side\\, characters like Snoke and Phasma thrown away with out any development and Resistance looking a bit ropey. Our 2 major characters are left without mentors and we roll credits.\\n\\nAll in all a poorly written film\\, with little character and story development\\, that leaves you thinking maybe the licence should have remained buried.","true":true}
