Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bait and switch\\, aggravated\\n\\nAs already said by many\\, Disney lured people into the theaters by using trailers made with the evident purpose of letting them think they were about to watch a REAL Star Wars movie. There were no hints of the director's intention to completely destroy the franchise in order to clean up the canvas for the new \\\"version\\\" of it.\\nIt has correctly been described as a form of Bait and Switch\\, an illegal conduct by which someone lures you into buying something with certain desirable and worthy features and\\, after you have paid for it\\, they give you something less worthy.\\n\\nThey did it again with the trailer for the BluRay\/DVD edition of The Last Jedi.\\n\\nWatch the trailer\\, and you will find NONE of the most hated features and scenes of it. No trace of Canto Bight. NO TRACE OF ROSE TICO !!!! No trace of all-males-are-evil and all-female-are-good propaganda. No trace of the purple haired inept vice admiral Holdo.\\nThe movie they present in the trailer IS NOT the movie you will get in the BluRay\/DVD edition.","true":true}
