I LOVED THIS GAME!!! It made me feel responsible for once! most games I kill blindly and without remorse as there is no real emotional connection between you and the npc's. When you kill an NPC and another finds their body or sees them get shot there usually a cry out of pain and possibly a name relating to the seemingly real life you as the player justI'm going to dive right into this.

I know a lot of negative reviews seem to focus on the fact that you don't agree with what Ellie is doing in this game. I think that this is the point. The game finally makes you feel bad for killing. I often times found myself stealth a lot more\\, to avoid killing NPC's. Unpopular opinion...I prefer the sequel to the first game. I love the aspect of walking a mile in another persons shoe's aspect. I love the love triangles\\, I love the artistic way they show comparisons between Ellie and Abby\\, I love the fact that they don't focus on Ellie being a lesbian as it should just be a normal thing\\, I love the real fear that a character you love might just die at any moment.
