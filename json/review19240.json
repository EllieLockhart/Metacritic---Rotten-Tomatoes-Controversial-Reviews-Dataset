Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a good film. The characters make stupid decisions\\, it doesn't feel human. The humor falls flat. It does a disservice to the already shallow Star Wars universe by not offering anything new\\, and simply undercutting what came before. I don't care where any of these characters go. And I won't be joining the cult of zombie fans who love these new films rabidly and without discernment. It's sad\\, but it's almost worse than Rogue One.","true":true}
