Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone clapped in the beginning\\, one person clapped at the end. The plot was abysmal\\, because of this any character development was punished for their situation being unnecessary\\, dumb\\, and convoluted poorly. Luke Skywalker was a incorruptible beacon of hope in the originals. In the LJ they made him a bum because it suited Rian Johnsons' horrible plot better. A ton of questions were made and only a couple of them were answered. Snoke and the entire first order were just one huge joke\\, now their being lead by the deeply complex character of Kylo Ren who appears to throw a tantrum every time he doesn't get what he want and is mad. Princess Liea should have been killed off\\, not Luke Skywalker! I can go on and on on an endless rant to why this movie was bad\\, but I'll leave it at one more sentence. This film was one huge disappointment.","true":true}
