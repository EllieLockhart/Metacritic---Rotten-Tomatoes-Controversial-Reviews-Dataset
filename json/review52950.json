Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A painfully obvious attempt to kill the existing Star Wars franchise and capitalize on the newer millennial crowd. This disjointed\\, trope-ridden action snoozer is filled with Disney's perceived social injustices that just HAVE to be righted\\, coupled with far too many \\\"What in Gods name am I watching?\\\" moments. \\n\\nAside from a wholly irrelevant 30 minute subplot that demonizes the rich\\, the premise of the movie is based on the assumption that the entire First Order armada has been utterly thwarted by a Resistance ship that travels just a little too fast at sublight speed. That's right folks\\, we're supposed to believe that the First Order built a planet-gun fueled by actual stars\\, but can't figure out how catch or destroy a single resistance Resistance ship.
