Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a poor movie\\, 0 respect from the saga... i don't even consider this one star wars movie\\, on top a spin-off... 2 stars for the scenario and photography\\, only for that!","true":true}
