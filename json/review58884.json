Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Awful awful story!First - I absolutely hate that you travel back and forth in time and people through the whole game. At times i lost track on what the story mission was about.Having to play almost half the game as Abby\\, was extremely annoying - i person i disliked through the game.I bought this game because the trailers led me to believe that this was a new story with Joel and Ellie\\, going on adventure again...how disappointing?The homosexual feel throughout the game (not that i have anything against peoples sexual choices - just not something i can relate to) was annoying too.The endless cutscenes with Abby and Owen were dead dead boring and uninteresting.Very few characters (unlike the first one\\, The brothers\\, Bill\\, Tess etc) were interesting or had something interesting about them.Manny was one of the few with a little spark\\, and wit - but he was wasted\\, without Abby ever using one second to feel sad over her losing a good friend.The ending is a no ending\\, I'm sure ND already have a part 3 planned...im done with this series. I can play tlou 1 over and over again - but I'll never play tlou 2 again.The visual and gameplay are of course outstanding\\, some of the best I've seen - but i buy these types of games because of the story - and storytelling have been a huge problem the last 10-15 years in games. Even the last uncharted\\, was a thin cup of tea storytelling wise - half the game is just the endning in one endless long mission. There are not many left who can tell a good story left in the gaming industry - Rockstar Games...Ubisoft - the can if they will\\,\u2026 Expand","true":true}
