Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode seemed to be made with little adherance to the established lore where force ghosts can now summon lightning (which would have been useful in earlier movies) and characters behave like someone else or just do nonsensical things. For example\\, Luke was mad about being found when he purposely left a map in R2D2 so he could be found. I tried hard to like it as I generally love most of the Star Wars episodes before this one\\, but I found this movie to be too poorly written to like even a little. The one thing I can't take away from this film is the cinematography. That was actually pretty good. As much as it pains me to say\\, it's a trash movie overall.","true":true}
