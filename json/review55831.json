Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretentious HACK\\, Rian Johnson thinks he's \\\"clever\\\" because he \\\"subverted expectations\\\".\\nNo\\, you dummy! Subverting expectations is only good when its done with skill\\, craft and intelligence! This \\\"subverts expectations\\\" because expectations were for a good follow up to Force Awakens but got this steaming pile of manure instead! \\n\\n\\nOh and look at all the paid trolls and bots here giving this trash 5 stars! LOL So obvious which accounts are fake.","true":true}
