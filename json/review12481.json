Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot see where the negatives are coming from.. I am\\, what i would class as a \\\"True\\\" Star Wars fan and i thought the Last Jedi was fantastic! there were of course some small parts that I did not like but on the whole I thought this was a raging success that moves the Star wars Saga along in a great way.","true":true}
