Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was bad... really bad. I was excited to see it\\, but now I wish I had not. Not the worst movie I have ever seen\\, but just gave me no feeling at all. It was not funny\\, the jokes that it did have seemed forced and flat. It was not inspiring\\, scary\\, fun\\, violent\\, it wasn't really anything. It just was. I kept hoping it would pick up\\, it never did. They focused a lot on the good guys all getting killed... I felt no connection to any character in the movie. The way it was shot and bounced around was confusing. To think that the critics liked it so much blows my mind. I guess I'm glad some one liked it because none of the people in the theater wit me seemed to. Ide rather they stop than make another one like this.","true":true}
