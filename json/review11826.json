Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How this script was signed off is beyond me. A terrible meandering plot filled with plot holes. A few terrific scenes and a few funny jarring moments do not make a decent film. Loved TFA and Rogue One. Hated this one. What an utter waste of Luke Sky Walker. Mark Hamill deserved better!
