Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am very disappointed with this movie.  Luke's character is completely castrated and turned into something else.  The guy who would not accept that Darth Vader was evil is the same one who decided his nephew\\, the son of his sister and best friend\\, deserved to die because he was heading in a bad direction.  There is no elaboration on why Rey has this understanding of the force that makes her a savant that can best one of the most well trained jedi's ever...and only with a few days training.  Not much done with Fin.  Plenty of SJW and 'oh\\, what about the animals' sub-plots.  There's a reason I don't watch the 2 minute commercials that just show sad animals and sad music.   I hate being pandered to\\, and at the end of the day\\, that is all this movie did for me.  The Tomatometer is a lie!","true":true}
