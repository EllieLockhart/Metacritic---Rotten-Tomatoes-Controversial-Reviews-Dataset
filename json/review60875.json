We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I won\u2019t go into the obvious good points of the game and jump right into what I didn\u2019t like. The plot.  If ND really wanted me and others to like Abby\\, they should\u2019ve made her spare Joel (who had just rescued her from certain death)\\, thus ruining their whole revenge idea for the rest of the game.  What does this mean?  They should\u2019ve scrapped this terrible plot.  Out of all the directions they could have taken this once great story\\, the direction they went was just incredibly bad.  Why not make another dr\/scientist character who was able to find a cure\\, only to fail at the end after Ellie willingly lets them kill her if you wanted to really tug at my heartstrings.  That could have been a huge amount of gameplay if the goal in the story was to find the cure like it was last time.  Other good ideas would include... having that creepy cult be full of immune people and purposely\\, even forcefully breeding to make more immune (pure) people and would better explain why they\u2019d want to kill other people and having it revealed that the team with the scientist who may have a cure has been kidnapping and killing these immune people over and over to find the cure and failing before they even attempted it with Ellie.  Then a revenge story would make sense.  Dina and\/or Joel\\, hell\\, even Abby would want revenge against them for lying to Ellie. Or the cultists could have kidnapped Ellie\\, discovering her immunity and trying to force her to breed.  That would be a compelling story about rescue\/and escape.  If they had taken a different course\\, Abby could\u2019ve been likable and even friends with Ellie. This entire thing was just a slog.  I couldn\u2019t believe I had to go through that huge traversal with Abby\\, knowing she was going to find her friends dead... where\u2019s the suspense in that?  I truly didn\u2019t care about what I was doing for most of this game.  I was really hoping to see some characters actually make more good decisions in this game.  I don\u2019t know why they decided to make most of the characters dullards with no emotional intelligence.  Why not give them the ability to have conversations and empathy that could avoid violence.  In the first game we see the separation of evil people and good people.  Guy protecting spunky girl who reminds him of his daughter vs. cannibals and merciless highway robbers.  In the end he makes a tough choice that puts him in a grey area\\, but those In this game we are forced over and over again to murder people who we don\u2019t really want to because of nonsensical decisions.  Sure it\u2019s a complicated world with monsters around every corner\\, and no therapists\\, but Jesus\\, give us some hope for humanity.  I was extremely disappointed by the events of this story.  Bleak indeed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
