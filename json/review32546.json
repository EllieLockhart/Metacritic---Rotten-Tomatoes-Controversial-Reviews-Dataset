{"101487":170098,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the last jedi ending spoiler:\\nIt turns out that all females were honorary jedis all along. The stormtroopers throw down their guns and everyone takes off all their clothes. Joan Baez comes out and they sing Kumbaya. Then all the males castrate themselves with a rock\\, apologize for being born male\\, then they march off a cliff to their deaths. The women learn how to clone themselves so that no pesky males ever are born again. The End.\\nRose almost caused the entire resistance to die because she saves Finn. Its just luck that she didn't  screw everyone because if Luke had not shown up then they would have all gotten slaughtered by the  New Order. Her little admission of love and silly cheek kiss followed by 'fainting' was seriously out  of place in an 'epic'. Very immature\\, O.C. moment. Imagine if a man said something like that today to  a woman and kissed her face without permission? He'd never work in Hollywood again\\, thats for sure.  But it's OK for a woman to do it because of freedom of female expression. Thats known as a 'double- standard'. I was bummed that Rey and Finns relationship from Force Awakens was tossed out for a fan  fic style one. \\nThe parts where Luke throws the saber on the ground\\, drinks blue milk and makes Rey sit outside the Shaolin temple for three days were unnecessary and unfunny\\, more fan fiction moments. Like jokes for people who don't like star wars\\, but are just seeing it with a friend.. Making Rey wait would at least make sense if Luke were testing her resolve\\, planning to teach her. But he really wants her to go away. Then the film takes a right-turn into preach-ville and has her woman-splain to him how dumb and guyish he's being so he changes his mind. I did enjoy the parts where he talked about the jedis being pointless vain despots who meant well at first. The road to Hell is paved with good  intentions.. ;)\\nFan fiction is when the writer has the characters doing something they would never normally do in the established story. Like Kirk and Spock kissing or similar. Another feature of fan fiction is when the author places themselves as a vitally important character in the setting of a the story. They usually write themselves in as the best friend or lover of the main protagonists. Rose seems like just such a character\\, except shes not representational of the author\\, but of a desired demographic whom the corporate bean counters feel is 'missing out' on liking a profitable scifi movie series from the 1970s. Namely\\, asian chicks. If theres one thing young asian women don't buy enough merch from\\, its certainly Star Wars\\, lets fix it! Wait\\, still no Hispanic women characters?!? Trash the movie online! Boycott!\\nPeople who need a member of their own demographic to be present in a work of fiction to enjoy it are the racists\/sexists. Not the filmmakers for failing to put in a member of each and every demographic group\\, like a bean counters ark. I watch a ton of Hong Kong films and I never find myself thinking how I cant get into them or cant imagine myself in the story unless there are white characters. (They rarely have any unless whitey is the villian\\, usually a rich businessman fatcat.) \\nThis Bollywood movie SUCKS because there is no white character for me to pretend to be..! Could you imagine thinking such a racist thought? No? But its Ok to think that about movies with white characters that were made when the population of the USA was predominatly white? But what if theres just one token character that matches your race and you dont like that character? Its totally OK because the presence of the one token character means that the filmakers and production company as an organic entity wholly endorse equality\\, right..? It's so not crazy to think that.. \\nCast race breakdown of film=amount of racism production company endorses. ITS SO SIMPLE..\\nThe jokes with Kylo and Vex were a lot funnier partly because of the better lines but also because they havent been established as being oh say\\, the kind of person who would never toss a lightsaber as if they're on a 1960s comedy sketch show..\\nThe DJ hacker character was very Guardians-esque. He shows up from nowhere with no foreshadowing. It seemed very strange that they had time to go dick around in another setting while there was a slow chase going on. Thats why it confused me when they showed up in the casino location.\\nThe basic main problem was the the actor who plays Rose is very high school-level\\, she's awful. They  should have gotten any other actor to do it. There are many actors who are of Asian descent in that age category who are a lot better than her\\, like Dichen Lachman or Chloe Bennett. Tran is completely ingenue\\, her self-conscious and vernacular So-Cal line delivery was just cringeworthy all the way through. She literally seemed like a fan who won a part in the film from a contest\\, she was noticeably even worse next to the rest of the stellar cast.\\nThe kid actors at the end of the movie are awful as well. They showed them for too long and it  highlighted their lack of chops. That made the movie seem like a fan fiction or low budget  production. It breaks one out of the narrative. The way they filmed the children in the prequels was far less annoying. It was as if the kids that got chosen were the producers kids\\, which would be Ok if they could act\\, at all\\, in any way. The way the scene was filmed was too cheesy and overly dumbed down. WE GET IT\\, ALL RIGHT..? The only thing missing was the Children are the Future song from Michael Jackson playing in the background\\, which actually would have improved the scene quite a bit.\\nDid R2 D2 have to be such an anti social robot and stay deactivated for 18 years? What if they had decided to go somewhere? Do they have to put him on a trailer? Why would the map be safer with him inert..? Rather than actively protecting himself? Real nice time for 3PO.. Good thing no one thought he was broken and threw him in the trash. Im sure someone would have at least written graffitti all over him. No mention of C-3pos red arm\\, either. Just like on Lost\\, lots of enigmatic secrets that have no one bothering to do the origin story. Its just an exercise in filming suspense\\, never revealing anything because douchebag Hollywood jet setters dont have time to bother with that much effort. Theres catering to be had and celeb parties to get trashed at and show your junk to aspiring artists and stage hands. Origin story? Have another cocaine frosted coconut shrimp and chillax\\, writer person! Porgs and black BB-8 seemed shoehorned in with very little screen time\\, purely to sell merch of a redco and critters that arent all that cute\\, but taste good with BBQ sauce.\\nYoda animations looked terrible\\, the original puppet looked real\\, ever since then the CG versions look like sundried green tomaotoes with whiskers. Him saying to burn down jedi temple made no sense. It took away the only reason Luke had to be living there. (You can help our generation by going to Washington and burning down the Library of Congress today! Lets do it right now! Makes total sense?!?) 'Those who forget the past are doomed to.. BE AWESOME..!' AMIRITE?!?  (Takes selfie.) #Iaintafraidofnojedighost\\nThe constant telephone conversation between Rey and Kylo seemed like a cop out way to make the plot move along quicker. It was annoying and felt cheap. [It was cool and scary the first time but doing it over and over got old fast. One time would have been sufficient.]\\nThe space-flying Leia looked very CG animated and fake. It had a Tinkerbell-esque movement that screamed Disney. The fact that no one reacted when she got back on board was very weird. It would have been way better to show her saving someone else's life rather than just her own\\, using  telekinesis\\, onboard the ship. The reason she doesn't show her force powers in the original movies isn't sexism\\, (see both Fantastic Four movies treatment of Sue Richards for that)\\, she doesn't use  the force because her being Luke's sister wasn't originally planned until part three. There was another said Yoda\\, not Leia\\, it was a new male character that they cut out (obviously a cracker too). That's why Leia kisses Luke in the med bay in ESB\\, not because of a mistake or a dirty in-joke\\, she hadn't been written as the sister yet. The reason they added it to return of the jedi was that the revelation that Vader was Luke's dad went over so famously that they wanted to pull the same trick in every movie. If you look\\, George Lucas has had an aha\\, I'm secretly your relative moment in every single movie he has done since then. Even in Indiana Jones 4 they pulled that same schtick with Indy and Mutt. \\nWhats is seriously the point in getting a famous person to play a part and then never take off her helmet like Captain Phasma? They should have shown her face at least once so that they could have made more toys with a different head sculpt.\\nWhy do all the male Admirals have a uniform (Admiral Akbar\\, Solo\\, Calrissian) but the women wear flowing dresses and have no sidearm? Laura Derns character design was awful\\, her purple hair looked  non-sequiter and she seemed too darn friendly to be a high fleet official. She looked more like a high school dance chaperone. She needed medals on her chest and an arm patch identifying her as a member of a military unit. The old 'have to suicide pilot the ship manully' gig has been overplayed and was completely predictable here. The movie started with the cliched 'running-running being-chased' trope too. Its like they read David Mamets how to make films book backwards and just did all the things he said not to do. No more title crawls because people cant sit through three paragraphs of words unless its texts from their bff during the movie!!\\nI loved Force Awakens. I love Rey. This was too preachy in about 6-7 parts. Like watching an ABC  Afternoon Special. \\nThey couldn't make it 10 minutes without forcing another female character down our throats\\, looking like they are never wrong\\, steely calm or glib and knowledgable about any concievable subject and that all men should just stop being these supposed yelling spazzes. If women in North Am think men are that bad with the hipster-wank microaggressions they put up with here\\, they should seriously take a trip to  the rest of the world. Like Russia\\, the middle east or India. Men here for the most part try to be fair\\, especially in online venues since decades ago they were told to be\\, by everyone from thier parents to teachers and the media. But still they get aggressively trolled for any comments no matter what by unpleasable busybodies with a soap box on facebook and twitter. Remember when that twitter poster recently said they wanted to hit a feminist? And all these males came on twitter and said they were feminists. Even the original gay male poster was being misquoted. There basically werent any men on there agreeing with the original post. Maybe a couple of 12 year olds whose parents don't monitor them online\\, but there certainly werent overwhelming amounts of macho men.\\nYet suppposedly its terible for women here. Mainly because young people today confuse their own feelings of akwardness during live conversations with others as predjudice. If someone mentions sexuality or racial issues in their presence they get all nervous and panicky because they havent  formulated a personal response and then later on they tell their friends and co-workers that the person they talked to was sexist or racist when really they hardly said anything.\\nFrom the writers at blogs like Gawker and Cracked to the celebrity actors who tweet\\, to the directors of star wars movies\\, there are barely any actual male chavinists left out there in 2017. Just female ones who say for men to 'man up' and then get upset if they say anything. Men are more than OK with strong foriegn women heroes\\, they just recognize shallow pandering and double standards when it is shown so inelegantly. Dont shoot the messenger when the soup has too many chefs. It felt insulting that so many parts were added in that made men look like aholes and women like snide perfectionists. Just to pander to a group of vocal moms who in real life arent customers of Star Wars and wont buy very much merch if at all no matter what additions are put for them. And they will still complain about anything they can think of no matter how many concessions were made for them. So we have to be afraid they will ruin our movies if they dont approve of them\\, using their online over reaction machinery.\\nThis is the problem with not having face to face discussions\\, people are more polite when they are looking directly at someone while conversing. Sheltered snowflakes\\, chronically addicted to outrage\\, taking themselves too seriously\\, using the debate tactics of a 9 year old child\\, that's undeserved online blogger fame for you. Most of them are FSB robots anyways\\, no point in getting upset about their AI generated comment scripts. \\nI like Jyn Erso and Rey but not Rose. Nothing to do with her being asian. I like Gina Torres from Firefly and I own more than 400 Hong Kong kung fu movies on DVD many of which feature terrific real world female fighters like Maggie Q\\, Michelle Yeoh\\, and Cynthia Khan. (All better actors than Tran too.) Ive spent over $2200 on Gal Godot figures\\, statues and merch and shes Isreali. I have many Don Cheadle War Machine figures. So I dont need the actors to be white\\, like is assumed by the 'pat themselves on the back for not being teh racist' faux-clickbaiter-activist\\, shrieking posters will no doubt try to claim. Having a token member of each race in a work of fiction is nowadays needed to avoid claims of supporting racism\\, or at least endorsing it. A lot of people told George Lucas that Star Wars was racist becuse of all the white characters. George Lucas is Jewish so you know that he's probably a white supremacist and member of the Nazi paty.. Like\\, how self involved would somebody have to be to not watch star wars and then go on the nightly news to accuse a Jewish man of being racist? If youre one of the people clicking on causes and getting all up in commenters faces then you are the problem\\, not supposed chauvenist remnants. Go help society by getting off your butt and bothering the local government and police to stop beating up black people and killing natives\\, instead of calling some internet filmgoer sexist for not liking being talked down to like they're a morally handicapped juvenile delinquent.\\nValerian\\, Avatar\\, and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow are all recent\\, way better movies than Last Jedi which are attempting the same tone\/genre and have strong female protagonists. (Consistently better written dialogue\\, more 'fun' overall experience\\, less eye rolls and cringes\\, not as blatently preachy.) Not to mention the awesome Rebels tv show which has Asohka\\, is popular with fans and well reviewed\\, and isnt too condescending.\\nMost people can't explain why they like or dislike anything\\, just their overall mood. Its easy to bait someone online by attacking their intelligence\\, calling them predjudiced or saying the  equivalent of them needing to smile more and 'not worry about it' in online comments.\\nI watch a ton of Hong Kong kung fu movies. It would be sooo racist if I were to say\\, 'Well too bad there arent any white people for me to fantasize about in this movie'. Yet its ok for others to say that about films with caucasian protagonists. We dont NEED to have someone just like ourselves in a movie to love it. We cant make every movie about the particular audience member who will cry racism when there isnt every single race on Earth in every single movie. No one was on twitter spazzing when Family Matters had only black characters\\, because its a show for black people to enjoy. I just see this as reverse racism disguised as social crusading\/backpatting. Its backwards and definitely a first world issue. The person who says \\\"I cant like this because Luke is white\\\"\\, is actually the racist person\\, sorry but you are..","true":true}
