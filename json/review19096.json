Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to imagine a worse story than this one. Disney was given one of the most iconic characters in cinematic history and completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) wasted him. You know the scene where Luke is handed his lightsaber and he chucks it over a cliff? That's a metaphor for what Disney (actually Kathleen Kennedy) has done. Star Wars is a dead franchise unless it walks back the decisions it has made...somehow.","true":true}
