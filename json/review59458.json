Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game was amazing to me honestly\\, if you can go in with an open mind and try to understand everything\\, even if it's just a little\\, this game will emotionally grab you and walk you through it's story and even more amazing world story telling\\, characters feel like real people with their own proper\\, real issues that they have to live with\\, try your best to ignore all the hate it gets online\\, cause as far as I've seen\\, 80% of people I see talking crap about it haven't even played it and are just going off of a 20 minute rant video by someone with a bad mindset about the game\\, trust me\\, the story grabs you and will lovingly and painfully show you the true horrors of the Last Of Us world\\, weather it be the infected themselves\\, or the even less predictable humans\\, this game even made me cry at the end and yearn for Joel at the end\\, where he's most needed for Ellie than ever\\,  as far as I can tell\\, story wise\\, it's amazing\\, gameplay and graphically\\, it's also amazing\\, the only ever issue I had\\, was not having enough differentiation between all the guns\\, as well as it feels like not enough of them\\, but that's personal opinion.
