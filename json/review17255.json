Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really think the film critics are afraid if they honestly review this movie\\, Disney will black list them. The best part of the movie was when the credits came around so that I could leave. \\nThe movie was pretty much unwatchable because of the feeble plot and sub plots and the pointlessness of it all. Also this 2 1\/2 hr movie could have concluded in 90 minutes... was unnecessarily long.","true":true}
