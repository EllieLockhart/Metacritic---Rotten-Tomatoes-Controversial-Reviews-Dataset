Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not a big Star Wars freak\/geek\/nerd\\, but I genuinely enjoy the franchise. That being said\\, #StarWarsTheLastJedi was incredible! Refreshing\\, crazy twists\\, and quite possibly the franchise\u2019s best to date. I\u2019m not even slightly joking - awesome movie!","true":true}
