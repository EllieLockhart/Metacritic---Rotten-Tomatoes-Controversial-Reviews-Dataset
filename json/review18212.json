Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was very entertaining and I was not paid to say that. The film added great explanation of the Force and some awesome new powers. Kylo Ren and Rey had a very interesting relationship which culminated in a riveting scene. All the actors gave great performances especially Mark Hamil and Adam Driver and of course the CGI was stunning. However I will say that there were some sequences that seemed like filler and some characters were built up in promotional material but ended up having really disappointed roles in the final product.","true":true}
