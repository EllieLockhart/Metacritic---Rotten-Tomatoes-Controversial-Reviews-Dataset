Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just got back from MJ Cinema in Harlem\\, saw The Last Jedi\\, Epic from beginning to end\\, a lot of action and high drama and of course The late great Carrie Fisher going out in a blaze of glory in her final film ever.\\n\\nThe Force will always be with her\\, R.I.P.
