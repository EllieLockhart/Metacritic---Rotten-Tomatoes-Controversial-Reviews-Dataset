Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**Updating my score since I read 1\/2 stars are not being included in the calculation. This movie is trash and should really be rated ZERO stars.** There were a few scenes I enjoyed\\, but overall I felt frustrated throughout the entire movie. It did not feel like it belonged with the rest of the series and I feel does not live up to the Star Wars name. There's a reason people love Star Wars and this director decided to abandon those things and reinvent what Star Wars is. He is obviously underestimating the power of nostalgia. Instead\\, he tried to be a revolutionary and in the end broke the hearts of Star Wars fans. So\\, so disappointed.","true":true}
