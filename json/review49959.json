Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You'll never like the Last Jedi until you understand what it set out to do: \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" Once you understand this objective\\, I have a spark of hope that you'll see TLJ for the iconoclastic masterpiece that it is. In the light of this objective\\, the film's multitudinous tradition-destroying scenes shine with genius. The chief example of this approach is Luke's defeat of Ben in Act Three. Without striking a single blow\\, he shows that \\\"oft evil will shall evil mar\\\" and defeats the young villain with a simple trick. ","true":true}
