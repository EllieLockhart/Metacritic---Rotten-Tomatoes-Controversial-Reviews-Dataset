Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film made by someone who doesn't care about Star Wars or it's characters. Fantasy has been replaced by characters who speak like present day society. Every character is funny\\, no character is vulnerable\\, so what we have is a nice looking thrill ride with no stakes. It feels like a low quality marvel movie which everyone tries their best to quip like Robert Downey Jr.\\, wrapped with Star Wars wrapping paper. Johnson's writing feels like a first draft and the future of Star Wars could suffer for it. There are moments fans can enjoy\\, but overall this feels like a movie made by someone who didn't care about Star Wars before making this movie.","true":true}
