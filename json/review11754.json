Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How disappointing. You can tell Disney has taken over the series. Too much comedy and forced humor. This came off as almost as a kids movie. I was surprised to read all the reviews and see that most fans had the same opinion. I pray Disney or whoever sees how unwell this movie went over with th fan base and can save it. Underdeveloped characters. Pointless side plot. Rose is the stupidest character in any Star Wars movie so far.","true":true}
