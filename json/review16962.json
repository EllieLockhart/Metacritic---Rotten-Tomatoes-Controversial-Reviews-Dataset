Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I pre-ordered tickets for the first time in my life and skipped out on spending time with family to go see this. I regret both things. Sure\\, there are some really cool things in this movie and for passive Star Wars fans\\, they will enjoy it\\, as for someone who tries to keep up on all the current canon\\, it feels like a spit to the face. So much much retconning is done where it feels like--I don't know. \\n***spoiler***\\nAs for the main death\\, I thought it was fine. It was good and fitting. It isn't why I feel this way.","true":true}
