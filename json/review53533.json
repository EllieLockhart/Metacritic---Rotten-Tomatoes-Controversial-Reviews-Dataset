Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 8 is the worst Star Wars movie ever.  If you would have told me\\, forty years ago\\, that in the future there would be SW movies that I didn't care for\\, I never would have believed you.  And yet it happened.  \\n\\nI didn't like Episode 7 because it destroyed the fairy-tale ending of Episode 6\\, plus Han was killed off\\, plus the Expanded Universe was obviously trashed by Disney.  There were also too many instances of me thinking\\, \\\"Huh\\, I've seen that before.\\\"  So\\, when Episode 8 came around\\, I had very low expectations even though I thought Rogue One was excellent.  I had to attend Episode 8 by myself because my husband so despised Episode 7 that he refused to go.  But\\, I was curious even though I\\, again\\, wasn't expecting much.  Unfortunately\\, I was right.\\n\\nThe writer\/director managed to trash Luke Skywalker before fading him out.  That is probably the worst element in this movie.  The plot so meandered that I had to ask myself now and then\\, \\\"Wait\\, what were they doing now?\\\"  Were there any worthy male military commanders on screen at all for any length of time?  Darth Angsty-Teen (nod to Facebook) aka Darth Ovaltine aka Ben Solo (not Jacen Solo) was at least as annoying as in Episode 7.  Then there's that pesky lack of gravity problem in space\\, the Mary Poppins moment\\, etc.\\, that many other reviewers have mentioned.  It adds up to a bad movie all around.\\n\\nWhen I left the theater\\, I thought that giving it three stars was being generous and that really it deserved two and a half.  But\\, having several days to think about it\\, I have downgraded that to one star.  Really\\, I would give it maybe a quarter of a star\\, but I did like the animals in the movie\\, so I give them one full star.  That is sad.  I am giving a Star Wars movie one star to boost my rating only because I liked the CG animals in it.  Unbelievable.  \\n\\nI have been saying for two years now that I wouldn't buy the DVD for Episode 7 until it was down to five dollars.  Now having seen Episode 8\\, maybe five dollars is too much for either of them.  At this point I think I will go to Episode 9 (by myself again) only for curiosity's sake\\, but then again\\, by that time\\, maybe I won't.","true":true}
