Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga\u2019s legacy while showing the emotion-rich action fans could hope for us the correct way to say it!!!!! Must watch! The most surprises in a Star Wars movie!","true":true}
