Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of SW for the past 40 of my 42 years on this Earth\\, I can CONFIDENTLY say The Last Jedi is the BEST Star Wars film..","true":true}
