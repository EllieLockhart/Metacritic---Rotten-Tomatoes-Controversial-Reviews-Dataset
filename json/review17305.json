Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed The Force Awakens and how it left me wanting more. This movie has managed to ruin TFA. Poor story\\, major plot and star wars mythos incongruity. \\n\\nImagine if they killed the Emperor in the 2nd film of the original trilogy then Luke trains Yoda and somehow becomes stronger in the force afterwards. Then somewhere out there for no reason Han Solo meets some random girl and they become romanticly involved before the movie ends and it all has bearing on the story's development whatsoever. That's this movie in a nutshell.\\n\\nAnd underlying all of it are not so subtle messages they'll shove in your face through undeveloped or under developed characters you could care less about when all is said and done.
