Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the haters! This is the freshest installment of the Star Wars saga in decades. Yes\\, things are bleak for our Resistance heroes\\, and everyone is struggling to figure out who they are\\, what they stand for\\, and whether to be burdened by the past or to learn from it. Between visually spectacular VFX sequences\\, there's a lot of character development\\, complex nuance\\, and some cracking dialogue (thanks to uncredited rewrites from the late Carrie Fisher). I grew up with the series - in fact Star Wars was the first movie I remember seeing in the theater - and this movie deftly spins things for a new generation of heroes and fans. Go see it in IMAX 3D if you can.","true":true}
