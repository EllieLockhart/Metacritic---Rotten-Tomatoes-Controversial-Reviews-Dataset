Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Force Last Jedi is a movie full of amazing effects and some really amazing turns. Pernsonally i dont like the humor that seems to be omnipresent but i beleve it can be a selling point for others. Altogether there are a lot of plot holes some bad lines and i personally find the changes to Lukes charakter more than underwelming","true":true}
