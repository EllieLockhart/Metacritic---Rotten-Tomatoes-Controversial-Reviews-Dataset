Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cringe-worthy. Probably a franchise killer. Rushed and unlikable characters\\, huge plot holes\\, bad writing decisions and just rediculous moments. If you thought the prequels were bad\\, get ready for this! If you're a long time fan\\, prepare yourself for a major let down.","true":true}
