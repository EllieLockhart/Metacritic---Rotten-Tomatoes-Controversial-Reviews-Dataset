Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone who has seen this movie and thinks it's not Star Wars or its a bad movie has their head up their butt.

It touched on many themes for the universe to move forward and not continue to repeat common themes of just Jedi versus Sith.\\n\\nAlso Yoda is back and literally sets thing on fire like the little goblin he was in Empire and Jedi.","true":true}
