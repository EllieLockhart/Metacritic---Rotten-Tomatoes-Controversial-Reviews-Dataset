Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was beyond terrible\\, I just don't understand how such an amazing space opera that was the original trilogy could be regularly butchered. This film in particular had the most incoherent plot \\, underdeveloped characters\\, and ridiculous and gimmicky plot twists. Did the critics see the same movie that the general public did\\, because I have no clue what movie they saw\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi was AWFUL.","true":true}
