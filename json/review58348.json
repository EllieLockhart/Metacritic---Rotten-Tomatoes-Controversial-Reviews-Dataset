Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fantastic\\, but flawed movie.\\n\\n*SPOILERS*\\n\\nHighlights:\\n- Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Driver brings life a interesting\\, deep\\, conflicted villain and I hung onto every word he said.\\n- Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. Luke's character in this is different from we've seen in the past\\, but that's what I find amazing about it. This is a Luke that has been through hell\\, has had everything ripped away from him\\, and he blames himself. This is a broken Luke\\, and Mark Hamill does a fantastic job bringing that across.\\n- The battle with the royal guards.\\n- The light speed scene. Yes\\, that one.\\n- CGI looked great.\\n- The porgs were surprisingly funny and entertaining. I was expecting another Jar Jar\\, I'm so glad I was wrong.\\n- BB-8. Good fun in every scene he is in.\\n\\nLowlights:\\n- I don't understand why Captain Holdor didn't just tell the rebels her plan. I would have saved a lot of lives and would have stopped the mutiny\\, and stopped Rose & Finn going on a pointless mission.\\n- Rose\/Finn side story. Was completely pointless and sometimes even dull. They end up accomplishing nothing anyway. Added nothing to the movie except to bad out the right time.\\n- Captain Phasma. This character had so much potential. But she does nothing of note in either this film or TFA. She now joins the 'Hall of Characters Who Are Inexplicably Popular Even Though They Did Nothing To Warrant It' alonside Boba Fett.\\n- The Leia Space scene. Seriously\\, WTF was that?\\n\\nOverall\\, I enjoyed this movie. As a long time Star Wars fan\\, this gave me pretty much everything I asked for. While this movie is flawed\\, I do not understand the hatred it seems to be getting from the fan base.\\n\\nAs a long time Star Wars fan\\, I give this a very large thumbs up.","true":true}
