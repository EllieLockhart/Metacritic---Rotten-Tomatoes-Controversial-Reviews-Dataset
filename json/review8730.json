Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all the fans that made Star Wars the colossal franchise it is now will be disappointed with the direction Disney has Luke take in this film. The story was weak with chance\\, not the force\\, saving lead characters. Snoke was apparently an idiot with henchmen. The landscapes and effects we're great\\, that is it. The rest of the movie goes in the trash. Luke the most powerful Jedi? No\\, not in this reality\\, way to screw the fans over Disney. Very dissatisfied this movie.","true":true}
