Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up with the original trilogy\\, playing with the toys and pretending to be a Jedi.  When I was in my 20's I saw the prequels which were admittedly flawed\\, but I still watched them multiple times and enjoyed them.  The sequels have none of the optimistic\\, fairy tale-like magic of the original. The Last Jedi looks good\\, visually\\, but it makes little sense\\, has characters with little charisma and tries to be too smart and stylish at the expense of the franchise's spirit.","true":true}
