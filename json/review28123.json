Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pointless subplot with a diversity hire\\, mary sue back at it again\\, feels exactly like episode 5\\, Luke was potrait horrible by rian. Too much happened that should'nt have happened. Lots of space logic ignored. Rian johnsons ruined the future of star wars with this","true":true}
