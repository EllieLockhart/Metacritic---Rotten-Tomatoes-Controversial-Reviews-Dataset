Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been so dissapointed at a movie in my life. I was going to write a review but what's the point? The critics say its great so it must be. \\n\\ncaution!!! \\n\\nThis is NOT a Star Wars movie.\\nThis is a Disney movie. \\n\\n1 Star for the hyperspace crash. Nice one. Literally.","true":true}
