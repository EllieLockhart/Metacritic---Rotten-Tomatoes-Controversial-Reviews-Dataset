Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie undermines forty years of mythology. Known characters behave in an inconsistent manner to their previously established personality. All of the newly introduced characters are two-dimensional at best\\, heroes and villains alike\\, which makes it impossible to feel anything\\, when they get killed off a short while later.","true":true}
