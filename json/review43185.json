Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This should've been an additional 40 mins to Episode VII. Just a cheap Disney filler movie to take your money until the final episode comes out. Very little happens\\, you could skip this movie\\, read a 1 paragraph summary of 2 events and save 2.5hours of your time.","true":true}
