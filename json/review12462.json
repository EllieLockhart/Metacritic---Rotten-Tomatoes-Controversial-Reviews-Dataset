Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why some may not be feeling this installment\\, but I loved it. 5* for sure.\\nSome of the devices used may be less than popular with the faithful\\, but I don't see how you further the story without them. I'll not discuss details for fear of spoilers\\, but if you like the Star Wars saga\\, this is a must watch.","true":true}
