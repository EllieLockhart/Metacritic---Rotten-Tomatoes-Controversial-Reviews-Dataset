Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold\\, Unexpected\\, Full of Risks... The Last Jedi shatters not just expectations but the foundation of the Star Wars Universe in a way that could reinvigorate the franchise if it doesn't completely break it apart in the process.","true":true}
