Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Characters are flat\\, undeveloped and uninteresting.\\nThe previously set up storylines and characters are left unexplained\\, handwaved or outright ruined by flip-flopping on the tone\\, background and motivations.\\nWithout getting into technicalities of science\\, in this science fiction-flavored fantasy movie. It defeats and disassembles previously set up \\\"science\\\" facts about its universe and makes no sense what so ever.\\nPlus this fields the LAMEST MARRY SUE OF ALL TIME and subverts previously established characteristics of long-standing icons of the universe.\\n\\nSave your money\\, don't go watch it\\, better yet\\, don't watch it on DVD either and save your time as well. If you absolutely have to see it\\, wait until there's a decent quality torrent upload and pirate it.","true":true}
