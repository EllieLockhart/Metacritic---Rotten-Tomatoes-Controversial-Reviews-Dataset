Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally signed up just so I can make my displeasure known about this poor follow up to TFA. The tone of that movie is totally lost in this movie. Some of the prequels offer a more cohesive story. Only reason I marginally liked TLJ more was at least there was no Jar Jar or poor acting young Anakin pod racing. Spoiler warning - ruined it for me to see Luke a grumpy old man. I was waiting for him to bark out\\,\\\"hey you kids get off my lawn!!\\\"  Disney would be smart to cancel their agreement with Rian Johnson or let him do anything on any movie related to Star Wars.  He has ruined the this beloved franchise.","true":true}
