Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved episode 7\\, thought Rogue One was even better... this fell flat. The humor was overused. ( and there just to add jokes... lacking a organic basis for it ) it was full of plot holes\\, and the tone was incredibly uneven. I could go on\\, and i would have passed it off and await episode 9... yet the director as continued to defend the movie and has made it clear he would change nothing\\, even blaming right wing groups for the poor audience score. (I won't dignify that with a comment) what does matter is out of 20 friends and family who have seen it all but two don't like it... hardly a small core fan base. I have suffered from medical problems my whole life and still remember my dad watching the original movies with me the the first time while I was in bed\\, him taking me to see the original trilogy on the big screen for the special edition release\\, bringing me action figures while I was in the hospital\\, since then I have read every single star wars book. I have been a forgiving fan\\, when they announced the books were no longer cannon I was ok with it when everyone said Disney would ruin star wars I stood up for it... see when your in constant severe pain\\, you need a galaxy far far away to escape to\\, and star wars never failed... until the last jedi. And for the first time I took my dad to see it at 10:30 pm opening night to see it. I for the first time in almost 25 years found myself disappointed and depressed  after seeing a star wars film. I was okay with most of the changes. (Not all\\, but most) no\\, what was disappointing was it was a low quality film... unforgivable for a star wars movie. But considering that the director is unmoved by anybody else's thoughts\\, I will leave my review at that. I'm hoping that the han solo movie  is a return to form\\,  and hopefully episode 9 will as well.","true":true}
