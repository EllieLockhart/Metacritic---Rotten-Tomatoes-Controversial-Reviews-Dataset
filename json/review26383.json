Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what I hoped for. Starting with the opening scene\\, through the awkward time consuming and ultimately pointless story arcs\\, to the finish which actually did \\\"end the way I expected\\\" I'd watch it again but I don't want to contribute to its box office success. Disney proved it could deliver hard hitting moments with Rogue One\\, but caters to a younger crowd and basic... um people... in this film. That being said\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fischer delivered unlike I ever expected.","true":true}
