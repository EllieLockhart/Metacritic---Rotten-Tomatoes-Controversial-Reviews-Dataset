Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie from the perspective of someone who liked the others a lot.  Creating all this hope around Snoke just to get rid of him was a let down.  No knowledge of his history or where he came from?  Luke\\, the greatest Jedi ever was made to be weak and his biggest heroic act?  A mere distraction?  What a disappointment.  No decent story.  No real plot.  Nothing about the Jedi scrolls\\, the temple?  Why show the island at all?  Why was Luke even in it?  He didn't even fight one battle?  Why even duck?  What a joke.  And for the record\\, I created this account just to give this movie a bad rating.  It pisses me off that people have to waste so much money to see something so bad.  It betrays everything George Lucas worked so hard to build.","true":true}
