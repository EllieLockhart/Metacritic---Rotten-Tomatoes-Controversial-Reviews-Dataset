Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really bad movie and a huge let down after The Force Awakens and Rogue One. Very poor handling of Luke and Leia character arcs and new characters not given a good enough story to develop their characters either. The most disappointing movie I have ever seen and now sadly the last new Star Wars movie I will ever see.","true":true}
