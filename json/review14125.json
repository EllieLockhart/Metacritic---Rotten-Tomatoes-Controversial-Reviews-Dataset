Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you've never seen a Star Wars movie before and you walked into a theater you would like this movie. However every actual Star Wars fan considers this a slap in the face. Ryan there should be a rule to make a Star Wars movie You Must Be a Star Wars fan! Useless characters\\, useless story arcs\\, and how do you have a Star wars movie with no Saber fights!  Not one! And Luke refers to a light Saber as a laser sword! ?!? What the actual fuck.","true":true}
