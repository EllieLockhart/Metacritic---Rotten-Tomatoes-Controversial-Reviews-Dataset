Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An awful movie. They ruined one of the greatest characters in cinematic history. All his character development was thrown out the window. He did things that were SUPREMELY out of character: trying to kill Kylo Ren\\, disregarding Rey\\, giving himself up to the Force. What a pathetic take. Plot holes everywhere. Awful movie. Don't see.","true":true}
