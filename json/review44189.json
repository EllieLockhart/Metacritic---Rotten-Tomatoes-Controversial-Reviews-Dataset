Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To mockingly paraphrase a line from the original \\\"Star Wars\\,\\\" The Last Jedi is not the film you're looking for... and that is because so many people have either unimaginatively speculated so much that they can not accept anything else\\, and there is a wave of fans that simply cling hard to the heroes and their repetitive adventures in the fan fiction \\\"Expanded Universe\\\" of books going back twenty-five years. This is the source of a lot of negative reviews\\, even by people who have publicly stated that they refuse to see the movie yet they have opinions anyway. When you extend a franchise's story for forty years and with the same characters becoming aging seniors\\, \\\"happily ever after\\\" begins to fade. Every moment with Carrie Fisher is a welcome one\\, and it is poignant to see her Leia character treated honorably and used throughout the film. New characters fit in nicely\\, although there are a few sequences that stretch the story\\, with a couple of classic characters given very little time. This movie also is said to bring a seemingly new tone to Star Wars\\, but not something that was never there in the original trilogy era. Some fans are in denial of that because they grew up oblivious to what they now critique as adults. The film leaves us anticipating a conclusion to a trilogy\\, but it almost works like a definite end of an era and with the reality of Carrie Fisher and even Kenny Baker dying last year\\, people should be open to that transition.","true":true}
