Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's so horrible I returned to my home at 3 am and watched Episode 5 to clean my soul and eyes. The super-humans-jedis-ladies and the super-loosers-boys is becoming rule in hollywood\\, it's a shame such ideology-crap spet in the audience.. Rest in peace George Lucas... RIP","true":true}
