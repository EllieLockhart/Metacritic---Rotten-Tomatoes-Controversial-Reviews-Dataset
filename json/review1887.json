Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from some minor pacing issues and out-of-place humor\\, The Last Jedi is a brilliant movie. No\\, it is not some feverish fanboy's fanfic about Space Messiah Luke Skywalker marching in and solving all the galaxy's problems with a few well-placed swings of his laser sword -- it's light-years better than that. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a well-told tale of interesting\\, flawed characters\\, who've messed up big and must learn from their mistakes and move forward. It's the story of how brave souls must stand to face the evils they've inherited from generations past\\, even as the flame of their Resistance is on the verge of being snuffed out. It's a story of the legacy of a man who epitomized the Dark Side and how even decades after his death his actions impact the lives of so many. It's about heroism and villainy and growth and maturity and responsibility and acceptance and treachery. \\n\\nIt's Star Wars\\, and not only that\\, it's a Star Wars movie that makes me genuinely excited about the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
