Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very discombobulated story. Many things didn't make sense. Extremely disappointing overall. I am a big star wars fan. Total letdown. Disney has destroyed this franchise. Sure they made a ton of money. Left the fans with a bag of poop","true":true}
