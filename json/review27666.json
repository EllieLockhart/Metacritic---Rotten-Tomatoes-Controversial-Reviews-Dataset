Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Parts that where good where amazing (Rey\/Kylo). But when they made a mistake ( bad unplaced jokes\/ruining a lead role\/forced storytelling at the casino\/terrible time management in the story\/Space Leia?!?) it was unforgivable bad.\\nDisney should stick more to the EU than wanting to make a kid\/family movie. And look back at the roots what made ep IV \/V \/ VI amazing. (Stunning movies with a double layerd story telling\\, and subtile jokes. It was too forced in TLJ.)","true":true}
