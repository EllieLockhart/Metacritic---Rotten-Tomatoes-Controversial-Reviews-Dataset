Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was a complete rip off of the other former Star Wars movies.  Did they even bother to write a script\\, or did they just copy\/paste from prior scripts?  This is what I expected from Disney\\, a complete and utter lack of imagination\\, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nHowever\\, I did give it an extra star for not destroying yet another \\\"death star.\\\"  That does get rather old after the third time.  It is also rather interesting to see just how out of touch the critics are with the fans.  The critics will try to dismiss this huge discrepancy on \\\"bots\\,\\\" but that is because they can't accept the fact that they are completely clueless with regard to the fans.","true":true}
