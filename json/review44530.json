Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To summarize: A lot of style with no substance. Side plots that go nowhere and some of the safest\\, dullest characters to ever grace the franchise take center stage. The only real risks the movie takes\\, is to shove out the old and replace with the new.","true":true}
