Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Man this movie had so much potential and it was all wasted so spectacularly. First off the dumb banter in the beginning when poe is talking to that general. Then when you have allllllllll this buildup with like luke and rae and he just tossed the lightsaber??? Wtf you literally wasted that perfectly set up suspense. Then you got Luke who was once so hopeful of good in people he believed in darth vader! Now he's trying to kill a kid because he sensed a little darkness? I don't buy it. Then a girl with like nooo training beats like skywalker in a little fight. luke skywalker who was supposed to be stronger then yoda or the emperor because he's everything vader would've been had vader's connie goin to the force not been dampened by all that machine he had attached. oh and there is allllll this build up over snoke nobody knows him and he's supposed to be extremely powerful and ancient. and he's killed with like a parlor trick? nahhhhhhh i don't buy that. they played this character to be soooo strong and mysterious and that's how he dies? so underwhelming and pathetic. Rian johnson should never direct a movie again and whoever wrote this script is pathetic and should also never write again","true":true}
