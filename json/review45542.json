Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing.  After the Force Awakens I immediately looked forward to the next (this movie).  After a couple years of waiting this was a complete let down for me.  This was not the Luke Skywalker of the original trilogy.  Many of the plot setups from TFA were ignored or tossed aside.  I don't feel any reason to look forward to or care if there is a next movie in the series.","true":true}
