Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story of Star Wars is Aniken the chosen one will bring balance to the forces and peace in the galaxy but he actually ends up becoming a Sith Lord and the balance is way off because of him but eventually Luke gets him to turn back to the light side of the force and he does bring peace to the galaxy after all and the prophecy was right. Buy making this movie it ruins the first 6 movies and the stories they told. At least the force awakens was decent even tho it was just basically a movie of re visiting the original 3 movies. The last Jedi had to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Just pure crap. I can't believe this is actually a movie and somehow got released.","true":true}
