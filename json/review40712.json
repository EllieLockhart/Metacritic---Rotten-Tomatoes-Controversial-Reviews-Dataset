Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This looked like a Star Wars film\\, and the special effects sounded like a Star Wars film. Those are probably the only good things that I have to say about the film. Way too many plot holes. Useless storyline that consumes about 30 minutes of the film. This thing really seems as if it were written and produced by people whom have nothing but contempt for the fans that built this franchise.","true":true}
