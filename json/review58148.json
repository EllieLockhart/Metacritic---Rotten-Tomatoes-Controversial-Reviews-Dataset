Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow in a bad way. I signed up purely to leave a review to try and save some of you some money. Until we stop spending money on Disneys terrible format of mindless scripting and stakeless set piece action they'll keep churning out junk like this and expect us to watch it. \\nAs a diehard Star Wars fanatic it pains me to say this film is garbage. \\nThe dialogue is a terrible series of one liners and ill placed jokes. The premise is poorly put together from a mishmash of ideas stolen from Empire without any of the grandeur that comes from having a storyline that actually makes sense and you feel invested in. \\nThere are very few good points Snoke and his omnipotence. The world design. But the premise. The actual editing. The timeline. The characters. The forced love interests. The keeping Leah alive when there were so many opportunities to say goodbye gracefully. The obvious inclusion of things and characters to make plush dolls out of. It just stinks. \\nThis one isn't for the fans or for anyone with 3 hours that they could better use walking the dog. Stream it if you have too. But don't give Disney the right to make another travesty of a Star Wars film.","true":true}
