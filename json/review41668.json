Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is just terrible. As much as Force awakens was a terrible star wars sequel\\, on its own it wasn't too bad of a movie. This one is just terrible in so so many ways i can't begin to describe them here\\, but suffice to say the plot is truly bad.","true":true}
