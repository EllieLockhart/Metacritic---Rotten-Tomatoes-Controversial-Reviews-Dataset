Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi truly is one of the best star wars movies of all time. The script is amazing\\, almost as beautiful as the the movie visually. The movie don't have not issues.","true":true}
