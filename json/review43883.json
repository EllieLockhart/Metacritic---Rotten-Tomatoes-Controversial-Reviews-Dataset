Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Those saying this movie is the worst in the Star Wars saga I think are being a little too zealous. This movie isn't as bad as the Phantom Menace\\, and doesn't have as cringy dialogue as Attack of the Clones. However\\, there are three serious issues that prevent it from being a good movie to me:  1. It does massive harm to the established characterization\/personalities of the original trilogy's lead characters. 2. It completely and utterly dismissed many of the plot lines established in The Force Awakens\\, and 3. It never gives backstory on some of the its own story points\\, or plot holes from the Force Awakens\\, and instead makes the holes worse. \\n\\nIf you are going to Star Wars for the cinematography and special effects and a shallow understanding of the Star Wars mythos\\, you will enjoy The Last Jedi. If you loved the original trilogy characters and good story telling\\, you will be sorely disappointed.","true":true}
