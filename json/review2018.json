Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone who grew up with Star Wars\\, I am heartbroken but not surprised. After Lucas sold the rights I knew Disney would milk the franchise. What I did not expect was  the mouse to kill off or totally ignore every character that made Star Wars dear to my heart in exchange for bigger destroyers or more Death Stars or milking sea cows. While there was some great eye candy in this movie (not a film by any stretch of the imagination)\\, I am left with sadness for a franchise and its future fans. What made the arc of the story so dear was that it was multi generational story\\, a universal mythology\\, not a token to be checked off as if part of a survey. Part of what made the Star Wars universe a beloved part in many of our hearts was that it taught us that we have so much to learn from those who came before us and the sacrifices they made. That all that is good and sacred in the world must be protected and earned. I'm afraid that Star Wars has fallen to the dark side.","true":true}
