Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was ready for a change from the original trilogy and loved the idea of new characters taking centre stage\\, so this is not a complaining 'fan boy' review. I really enjoyed the Force Awakens and was genuinely excited for the next part in the story. The Last Jedi seems disconnected from the Force Awakens. Many of the most interesting mysteries seem to swept under the rug (or cut in half). It became painfully obvious as the movie hit its end that episode VII and VIII were made and written by two different people with two completely different ideas about where they story should go. I don't understand why they would do this when they knew it was going to be a trilogy even before they started filming. This movie feels out of place as a second installment...parts like death of the major villian and the nearly complete decimation of the Resistance felt more like the conclusion to the story. There isn't really much left to look forward to for episode IX.","true":true}
