Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was afraid to get excited for this movie- I find that hype culture tends to lend its way to disappointment. With that in mind\\, I came into the Last Jedi expecting it to be \\\"fine\\\". Instead\\, I was engaged\\, entertained\\, and even emotional at times during my viewing.\\nThe movie is led by strong characters\\, ones we recognize from old\\, and the newer generation introduced to us in The Force Awakens. The pace of the story is quick\\, coupled with fast action scenes\\, but also moments of pause. The high points of the film surround the relationships between Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Luke Skywalker. The audience's expectations are constantly subverted by defying the troops that defined the original movies.\\nThe film is certainly not perfect; some sequences were dragged on\\, while others felt out of place and unexplained. It feels jarring that a New Republic is suddenly once more \\\"rebel scum\\\"\\, when really The First Order should be the rebels. \\nOverall\\, The Last Jedi takes great risks\\, and is rewarded by being a fresh take on the Star Wars formula.","true":true}
