Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, I greatly enjoyed this movie. Was it perfect? No. Did it explore new avenues of storytelling and give the characters a chance to develop in ways that were real and human? Yes. I look forward to seeing what this series will do in the future.","true":true}
