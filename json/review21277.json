Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie not knowing anything about the plot or what to expect. It delivered\\, but not what I expected. It raised many questions\\, but that only makes me want to see it again and see Episode 9 when it comes in 2019. It's not perfect\\, but none of the movies in this saga are\\, but as a fan I enjoyed it\\, my kids enjoyed it. As far as the length\\, some say it was too long\\, I felt like the movie had time to breathe\\, and to me it didn't feel like it was long\\, I wasn't sitting there waiting for it to be over. So def recommend seeing it at least once to take in\\, then once to find all the things you missed. Don't let the reviews or spoilers get to you before you see it.","true":true}
