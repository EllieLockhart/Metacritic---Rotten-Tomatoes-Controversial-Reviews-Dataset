Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a loathsome film. A tasteless loot bag of incoherent scenes\\, not a single one of which makes any sense. No plot\\, no thought\\, no tension\\, no respect; just cringeworthy nonsense and juvenile humour meant for audiences under the age of 12 (or adults who still think they're 12). After all the horrendously derivative material packed into the Force Awakens\\, you'd think they'd have gotten it out of their system--but they even redo the throne room scene and the Hoth scene in this one (oh but it's on a salt planet\\, not a snow planet--and they have the guy lick the ground and say \\\"salt\\\" to lampshade it). You have to be on a cocktail of narcotics to justify this kind of stuff. This is what I'd expect if a kid who wrote terrible Star Wars fan fiction won the Powerball and decided to spend all the winnings on bringing his vision to life\\, without any input from mom or dad\\, much less the general public. This was the last straw for me--I have no interest in this franchise anymore.","true":true}
