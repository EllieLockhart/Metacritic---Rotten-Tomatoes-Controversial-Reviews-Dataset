Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst starwars films I've ever seen.  And it really hurts you du that cause I wanted to like it so much. It literally felt like the film makers did everything they could to make it uninteresting.  There wasn't any big reveals.  The only surprise of the film was that there were no surprises.  Literally. None of the plot made any sense. The characters had a lot of potential to be great characters.  But it felt like they were just thrown in there for the neck of it.  You never really know who any of these nee people are. So you feel nothing when something happens to one of them.  The don't even explain who there main characters are.  Or why there capable of do what there doing. Honestly. It doesn't make sense to me that it could have been that bad.  This is my first review of a movie. It was that bad after 28yrs I've decided to share my feed back in hopes that we don't get another star wars where the film makers will think will be happy with a few good action scenes and enough plot holes to make you wonder if any one involved in the new movie had ever seen any other star wars films","true":true}
