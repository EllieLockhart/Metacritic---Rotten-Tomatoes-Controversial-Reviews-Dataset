Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its really no wonder that they did not want us to see reviews prior to seeing this movie.  This movie was terrible for any star wars fan.  Look at the user reviews and compare to the PAID reviewers to see the difference.","true":true}
