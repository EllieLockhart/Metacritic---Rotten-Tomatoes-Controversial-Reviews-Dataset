Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie feels even more JJ Abrams-y than the last one even though he didn't direct it. Cringey comedy\\, Harry Potterish characters and the best parts of the movie were quickly ruined. I was most worried about Mark Hamill`s acting but it was the best part of the movie. Script was horrible\\, nothing even happened in the movie that moved the narrative forward. Worst of all it just wasn't star wars.  Extremely disappointed.","true":true}
