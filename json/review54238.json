Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not understanding the hate from the general public\\, I really enjoyed TLJ. So many iconic scenes were crafted for this movie. So many new creatures created. Well rounded movie\\, heaps better than the prequels and right up there with the original trilogy in terms of quality. For me its the best Star Wars movie since Empire.","true":true}
