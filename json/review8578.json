Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First of all it was a movie to see in the cinema\\, well done Disney BUT it was NOT a Star Wars movie. Where to start from the throw away of Anakin lightsaber scene\\, from the goofiness of Rey\\, from the milking alien\\, from the eternal chase\\, from the f*** space I'm Mairy Poppins\\, from Snoke scene \\\"I can read your mind\\\" and \\\"I make you connect you fools\\\" dead by Kylos ignite lightsaber throw the Force\\, from Phasma the badass you always fall down\\, from the luke super-saiyan scene and many many more. Aaaahhh!! And Lukes death-force ghost\\, come on who the hell directed it the high school movie team. Not a Star Wars movie period. I watch all the movies-animated series and I loved them but this. No..No...Noooo...Noo....Hell..NO","true":true}
