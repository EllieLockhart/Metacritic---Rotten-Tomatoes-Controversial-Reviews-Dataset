Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why some people are frustrated with a few details in this movie\\, some are valid complaints\\, but to have so many half-star reviews is absurd. This is a very vocal minority from a very devoted fan base. Honestly\\, I won't know how I really feel about this movie for years\\, but it was exciting\\, emotional\\, surprising\\, and funny. If you hated Ewoks\\, then maybe the details will bother you enough to actually dislike this movie and the choices made by the creators. If not\\, then I don't see how you couldn't enjoy this movie.","true":true}
