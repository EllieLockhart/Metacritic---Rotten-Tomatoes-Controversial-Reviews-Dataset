Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a brutally low score by viewers\\, most likely a knee jerk reaction to the disappointment of failing to meet the same standard as its incredibly well received predecessor. The film certainly has its flaws\\, most notably its surprising additions and subtractions of fundamental characters\\, like the cheesy use of Yoda\\, and the odd loss of Luke. That being said\\, the film still served its most important function\\, to develop all the key players and set the stage for the final showdown\\, and it did it with enough humor and creativity to keep me more than intrigued.","true":true}
