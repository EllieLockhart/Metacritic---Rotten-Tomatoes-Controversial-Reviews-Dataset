Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie. JJ Abrams had played it safe with \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" by making a soft reboot. Many fans and critics alike said it was smart to play things safe and to reach new and old fans alike. While it wasn't the best movie\\, it brought Star Wars into the modern era. It set up many new\\, If somewhat boring characters for a great future within the trilogy. Episode 8\\, like episode 5\\, was set to be the darkest\\, most emotional\\, and best looking movie of the trilogy.\\n\\nHowever\\, Director Rian Johnson has made one of the worst movies in human history. The lack of a good plot\\, interesting new characters made it unwatchable. The obvious plot holes made it impossible to enjoy the somewhat dazzling special effects. The editing is absolutely atrocious. The character development has been completely thrown out the window. The forced awkward romance with the Trilogy's new Jar-Jar Binks\\, Rose Tico and Finn was forced and disgusting. There was no real lightsaber fight. And Luke Skywalker was never given any chance to be a hero","true":true}
