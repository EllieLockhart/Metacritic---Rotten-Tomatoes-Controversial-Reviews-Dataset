Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, I'm happy to see the franchise go in new directions but if that's the best explanation for how like went from return to here...just stop making movies. Mark Hamill have an amazing performance that is dam near the only redeeming quality of the film. More charming for how badly and drably his plot line was handled.","true":true}
