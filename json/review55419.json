Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Many reviewers who praise The Last Jedi\\, tend to criticize \\\"fanboys\\\" for having high expectations.  It's not unreasonable for fans to have certain expectations.  By nature\\, sequential movies based on an extensive canon compels one to do so.  The core fans who have invested in and sustained the franchise over the years\\, are the reason why Star Wars is a multi-billion-dollar business.  It's reasonable for these same fans to desire to have some of their expectations met.  It seems like Disney opted for cheap thrills and twists\\, instead of a cohesive storyline. \\n\\nDisney\/Lucasfilm could easily have created a movie that pleased most fan types\\, while still having a few plot twists.  Instead\\, they chose the latter ONLY.  Any Gungan can create plot twists or unexpected character portrayals for the sake of getting cheap thrills.  IMO\\, critics are overrating Rian Johnson as if he is another Christopher Nolan.  I couldn't help but feel that Rian Johnson wanted to intentionally nullify everything that J.J. Abrams setup (almost like an ego battle between directors).  \\n\\nI'm not going to repeat all the obvious pros and cons from other reviews\\, but just summarize a few:\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-\tSubtle racism.  The minorities (Black\\, Asian\\, Latino) have the most meaningless roles via a boring subplot that had no purpose other than to apparently show that another white female character had a \\\"better\\\" plan that a white male.  Only white females are elevated.  This continues in the tradition of TFA where Finn was teased as a Jedi to sell tickets to millions of black Americans\\, only to later be revealed as a \\\"sanitation\\\" worker; the white female ended up being the Jedi.  Finn is still portrayed as a \\\"coward\\\" in this film.  Totally disagree with white \\\"critics\\\" who say this movie is \\\"inclusive\\\".  Their idea of inclusivity is merely tossing in minorities just to \\\"appear\\\" tolerant and progressive (to me\\, another form of racism).\\n\\n-\tThe movie largely discredits many key themes & characters from previous Star Wars movies (including Episode VII).  The result is that Star Wars can now be anything it wants to be\\, i.e. your average sci-fi movie\\, of which there are plenty.  Instead of referring to this entry as \\\"Episode VIII\\\" it could have been called \\\"Star Wars 2017\\\".\\n\\n-\tUnnecessary politically-motivated themes.  These did not ruin the movie\\, but hints that developing a proper story was not the number one priority.","true":true}
