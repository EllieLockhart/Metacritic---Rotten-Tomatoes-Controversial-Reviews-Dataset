Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Corporate movie with a pointless plot\\, nothing actually happens\\, there is no compelling reason to care about any of the characters. some fun moments\\, but overall its a throwaway movie\\, easily forgettable story\\, and the way they handle legacy characters like Luke Skywalker\\, is a disgraceful way to disregard the past \\n greatness of the franchise.","true":true}
