Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Flat characters\\, poor arcs. Feels more like a B rate television mini series than a contribution to one of the greatest fictional worlds we have. \\nUsed primarily as a vessel to cram politically correct ideologies down the audiences throat at the expense of a good movie","true":true}
