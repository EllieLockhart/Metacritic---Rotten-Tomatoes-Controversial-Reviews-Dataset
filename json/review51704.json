Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A disappointment.  I really wanted to like this movie\\, but can't ignore the plot holes\\, the unanswered questions\\, the disregard for the OT characters\\, the poor use of the new characters\\, etc ...  Sad.  Never thought I would miss George Lucas :P","true":true}
