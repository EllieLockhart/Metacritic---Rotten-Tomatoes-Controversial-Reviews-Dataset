Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. It did so much I was hoping for a Star Wars movie to do. If you're wondering why the Audience Score is so low\\, there is actually a movement on social media to discredit this movie because there are hateful\\, childish people who think this is an important mission or something. Don't trust the audience score\\, trust your instinct. It's a beautifully written Star Wars film.","true":true}
