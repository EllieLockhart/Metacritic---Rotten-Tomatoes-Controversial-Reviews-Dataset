Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen the movie 4 times in total. First time at premiere and I could not believe this was middle movie in the trilogy. Second time to catch what have I missed. 3rd time when it was released on Blue ray and 4th time recently. This movie is the worst out of Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson threw out all the ideas and rules that Star Wars had. If it was a stand alone movie it might have worked but as a middle movie in trilogy it totally sucked. From jokes\\, space battle\\, space chase\\, casino part\\, the last battle to handling characters and creating a bonding between characters and audience. So many things do not make sense even in the sci-fi universe because this universe has been pretty well defined by 8 movies and animated Clone Wars series. This movie could have answer few questions\\, enrich the mythology and make Force Unleashed more meaningful. However\\, this movie shits on everything and is full of stupid decisions that leads to no more stupid situations. What I loved about this movie was performance of Mark Hamill\\, John Williams music\\, digital effects and beautiful cinematography. Otherwise it was very dull movie. The profit of this movie does not equal quality. The prequels are much better than this one is.","true":true}
