Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. Not sure why people say they hated it. I am guessing they created the movie in their head before they went and they had it completely wrong. I loved the fact that Rey's parents were nobody and that we did not get a back story on Snoke. The plot of the story is about Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and Kylo Ren. The action scenes were great and I enjoyed Mark Hamill showing he can really act.","true":true}
