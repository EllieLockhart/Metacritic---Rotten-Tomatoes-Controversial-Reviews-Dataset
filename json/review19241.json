Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a good Movie\\, I think is to Ep IV and ep v\\, but less epic. Ray is so powerful without training- Luke Skywalker's death is not incredible\\, not a good Movie.","true":true}
