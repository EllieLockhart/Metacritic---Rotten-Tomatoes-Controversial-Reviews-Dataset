Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created a profile here just to review this. Please see all the other bad reviews as they say it all. Must you pinko commi nitwits in Hollywood destroy EVERYTHING?  #firerian. Disney you should be ashamed. Unless the critics HATE the next one I'm not going to bother watching it. No wonder the critics are so fond of it. It's garbage!!!!  God willing this thing will be considered a huge flop.","true":true}
