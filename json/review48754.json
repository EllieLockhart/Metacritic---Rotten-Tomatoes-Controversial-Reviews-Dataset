Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie I've seen in a longtime. I felt no sense of urgency\\, the casino bit was pointless\\, in terms of character actions there were a lot of stupid decisions\\, and overall the movie dragged on to the point that it felt like a chore to watch.\\n\\nOnly redeeming part of the film would be the bits involving Luke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo. Unfortunately the idiocy of the film detracted from the positive aspects.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars fan my hopes have been ironically crushed.","true":true}
