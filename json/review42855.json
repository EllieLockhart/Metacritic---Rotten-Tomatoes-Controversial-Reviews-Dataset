Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was phenomenal\\, it was better than The Force Awakens and better than Rogue One. This movie had action\\, humour a good story and stunning visual effects. \\nI don't understand the negativity around this film\\, I honestly thought it was awesome.","true":true}
