Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst installment of all the Star Wars films. It doesn't even feel like star wars. It reminds more of a Marvel movie than Star Wars. The plot is both predictable and inconsequential. Rian Johnson mightve ruined the whole trilogy","true":true}
