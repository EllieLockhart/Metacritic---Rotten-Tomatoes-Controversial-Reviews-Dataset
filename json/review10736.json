Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half a year has passed and I still have not recovered from this. I have seen dozens of times each movie without exaggerating\\, even the prequels\\, with this I have not been able to do more than on December 15\\, 2017\\, and when the bluray came out. I do not want to see it again in order that the memories that my brain keeps disappear. Help us\\, bad results at the box office\\, you are our only hope.","true":true}
