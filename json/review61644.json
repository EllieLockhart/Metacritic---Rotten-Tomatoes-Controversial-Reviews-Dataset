It would make more sense if Ellie and Abby would turn out to be sisters. -if of course they could find a way to connect the dr. as their father which was killed by Joel-  but it would be justifiable for why Ellie just couldn't kill Abby at the end. But instead we get a sequel that makes no sense other than annoy it's fans story-wise and completely ignore customer expectations. You build a single game to sell\\, but if you build a universe and want it to be consistent you should be listening to your customer-base and not bash them with extremely irrational and childish responses on social media or try to cut them off to react the way they want with their opinions.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
