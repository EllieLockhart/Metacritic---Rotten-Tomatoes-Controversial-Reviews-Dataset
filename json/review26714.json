{"101487":159166,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, there's a lot going through my mind after watching this movie:  I come from the world where I read all the expanded universe books.  If you are a hardcore fan you will\\, most likely\\,  not like this movie. I define hardcore as someone that was really into the expanded universe.  For all others and the general populace it was a good movie.  Not great just good.\\n\\nPro's it's engaging\\, I never felt bored through the 2.5 hours of it\\,  The acting is great\\, honestly the cast is awesome.  Action is great and there's a lot of well placed humor and even some great cameo's.\\n\\nCons  I wasn't satisfied with Phasma\\, Luke and Snoke's characters.  Unfitting end in my opinions for all of them.  Wasted opportunities.  I'll expound upon this later.\\n\\n\\nWhere in the past all Star Wars movies were straight forward\\, this one is not.  The classics are in there heroism\\, Hope\\, Villainy\\, Humor\\, and Greed.  I didn't feel as any of them were forced. All there and on display\\, that's not where it ends though. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is going to make you think\\, The Last Jedi forces you to engage in critical thinking and perspective.  Not sure if it hits the mark storytelling wise.   But the intention is clear.  War profiteering\\, Treachery\\, perspective\\, all of these things that are working behind the scenes.  If anything\\, I thought Star Wars interjected a little bit of reality into this movie.  The undertones of the \\\"Elite\\\" pulling the strings of the First order and the Rebellion.  While those two fight\\, the elite prosper.  The Undertones of the Force being more than just everything that binds us and that it's not GOOD or BAD it's all  on your perspective..  You'll see very the very start when Ren and Rey's minds are being touched where they can \\\"feel\\\" one another that comes  into play near the end and decides the fate of one  of our Heroes.   Also the Perspective on reality for Luke and Kylo\\, each saw the same event  completely differently and how that molded the characters.  How Snoke and Kylo were having a battle of mental wits as well.   Was this too  heady for most?  Probably.  \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is not your typical Star War's space opera.  It's something more\\, it's different.  Different can hurt but I don't believe it's a bad thing.  The Last Jedi cements the passing of the torch.  Luke's story is finished\\, Rey and Ren's is starting.  Personally I thought Luke's end was  silly but given that the story telling was showing us that they could \\\"touch\\\" one another from great distances still doesn't make his ending any less bittersweet.  Phasma's end also bittersweet\\, I thought they could have expanded  her\\, gave her more but instead\\, just another bucket head except she was chrome.  I'm wholly unsatisfied with Snoke.  Where did he come from?  Not enough on the dark side and seeing \\\"balance\\\".\\n\\nOverall this was a good movie\\, not the worst not the greatest somewhere in the Episode 3 or 4 range.","true":true}
