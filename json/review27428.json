Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Outstanding.  Particularly for old fans. Story lines are a little too far reaching and not logical at times. The First Order is often cartoonishly incompetent and bumbling. But the principals are placed into more than enough beautiful and poetic scenes to overcome any under-written plot holes.","true":true}
