Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best Star Wars films to date. The fact that it destroys everything that we expect and sheds new life into the franchise is extremely invigorating. It takes what we know\\, and expands on it\\, twists it with something new and fresh. (9.4\/10)","true":true}
