Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall disappointing for a Star Wars movie. Full of plotholes and inconsistencies with previous films. For example\\, the Luke Skywalker character is totally out of line with Episodes 4-6. The seemingly all powerful villain Snoke is killed in such a ridiculously easy way. Rewatch previous Star Wars films (particularly Episodes 4-6) and you will realise how much Episode 8 is a lame shallow consumerist film.","true":true}
