Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dont know what that was... but it was NOT a starwars episode... may have made a kick ass independent \\\"spacy\\\" movie in some other far off universe.. but not the 3+decade old\\, heavily solidified starwars universe. It was unnecessarily funny at points and unnecessarily dark at points. Gave sour conclusions to epic fan speculation and missed major opportunities to hatch easter eggs for long time fans.. filled with CLEAR cherry picks from other episodes.. to sum it up.. the movie was EVERYthing i went to the theaters 2yrs ago expecting The Force Awakens to be (while J.J. Abrams hit a nostalgic homerun).. see y'all unfaithfully in 2 more years... hope to remain 'SOLO' in 12 months","true":true}
