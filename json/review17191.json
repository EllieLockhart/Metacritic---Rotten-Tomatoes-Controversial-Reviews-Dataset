Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked this movie\\, the first time I went and see it\\, the second I started to think about it\\, it really dissapointed me\\, there were a million of ways to make this movie perfect\\, but they went and made it really bad\\, and everything because of the script\\, this was lazy writing all over\\, they had an agenda and pushed it with lazyness and this is why this movie shall be remembered as one of the worst starwars movies of all times\\, but still is a decent\\, entreteingint flick.","true":true}
