{"101487":105121,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan\\, Star Wars has always meant a tremendous amount to me. I read many of the old books and even some of the post-Disney novels\\, all of which I gleaned various levels of enjoyment from. I even was one of those fans who liked the prequels\\, although I recognize why the majority of fans disliked them. The plot and universe that is Star Wars has always been fascinating and something that I have repeatedly sought to immerse myself in. That all said\\, The Last Jedi was a true disappointment in many different ways. The Force Awakens\\, although not without its own problems\\, was a pretty good movie. It set up a few compelling questions that I really wanted to know the answer. TLJ completely squashed those questions. It was a film that chose to abandon fundamental plot points from TFA and the rest of the saga\\, but for no apparent reason. Those abandoned plot points were critical in Star Wars\u2019 foundation. They were what made Star Wars what it was. I know some will praise TLJ for originality. And some will take it a step further and say that for all the criticism TFA got for being a rehash of A New Hope\\, TLJ gave those critics an original story. And those criticizing TLJ are hypocrites. I truly hate TLJ\\, but not because it\u2019s original. Rather\\, because it lacks cohesion\\, it\u2019s written poorly\\, it misses so many great opportunities\\, and it adds little to no character development to any of the heroes from the TFA. ***SPOILER*** The only characters that truly get developed are Luke Skywalker (maybe Kylo Ren a little bit too). Luke turned Vader to the light\\, blew up the first death star\\, and saved the galaxy twice. Instead of killing Vader\\, he threw down his lightsaber and refused the Emperor\u2019s wishes. Fast forward several decades into the future\\, and Luke is considering murdering a dark-side corrupted kid in his sleep. When that goes south\\, he abandons everything that helped him achieve what he did. This is indicative of a larger\\, lazily written story. TFA was written around the main plot-line of searching for Luke. It was even in the opening crawl. TLJ makes it clear that the map to Luke really makes no sense\\, and never mattered. I could go on and on\\, discussing the issues with Snoke\\, Rey\\, Leia\\, and the addition of a bunch of characters that no one cares about. This has ruined the future of Star Wars for me.
