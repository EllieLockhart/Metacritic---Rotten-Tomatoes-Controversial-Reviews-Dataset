Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bittersweet...love seeing my favorite Jedi and  crush Luke Skywalker. Great action...too many jokes...bad side was mocked. The Clone War series took it more seriously.\\nPhasma? Why even bother\\, I was expecting more of the only bad chic in the galaxy. Snoke...Liberace more like it. He was missing the piano. He looked like a zombified Hugh Heffner...Sad.\\nAlot of stories\\, no deph.","true":true}
