Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not terrible but not great either.   I am trying to not get swallowed up with nostalgia but there is just no denying the original trilogy is simply much better than the sequel trilogy films.    Main reason.   A sense of threat.   There is none inthe new films.   It's like Disney are terrified to make them too dramatic in case the six year olds get too scared.   I notice that with rogue one they were not concerned about this.    Perhaps that is because they are not as concerned about revenue with the stand alones than they are with the main trilogy now.  A real shame.  Wayyy to much weird humour in the new film which made the pacing of the movies very strange and unusual.  Hundreds of people are dying. Let's crack a joke.   Force awakens was the same.  It's such a shame because this main trilogy could Be awesome.    I have no wish to see this film again.  That's not the Star Wars I remember when I watched empire back to back in one sitting in the cinema.","true":true}
