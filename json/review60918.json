It\u2019s been almost three weeks since I finished the game and I am daily analyzing and thinking about the date of characters\\, what was\\, what could have been and possible what still might be. It isn\u2019t often I have been baffled and thrilled by a game quite like this. The last time was probably part 1\\, red dead redemption 1 or even back in MGS3. I will keep things short; Part 2 is a worthy and true sequel! Excellent stealth gameplay\\, fun set-pieces and explosive joy from start to finish. Wonderful graphics\\, acting\\, music and the feel of the world is far beyond any other experience out there these days. The story is emotional and you are right to hate some parts of it if you want. But believe me when I say that there are so much meaning and beauty in those moments you might hate and if you open your eyes and think about human motivation and the justification of making this sequel\\, it will all make perfect sense.This entire game is like a season of GOT\\, and then I\u2019m talking about one of the food once. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. A true modern masterpiece.Say no more\u2026 Expand","true":true}
