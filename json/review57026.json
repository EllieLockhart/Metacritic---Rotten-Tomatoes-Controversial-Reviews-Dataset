Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film displays a complete lack of understanding of the story world. While the constructs in the movie are acceptable its disregard for its place within its own trilogy undermine the movie as a whole.  If this was a stand alone movie i would rate it higher.  The Last Jedi deviates from the star wars franchise in terms of tone in such a manner that it feels separate from the rest of the franchise and consistently breaks previously set rules within its story world. Its attempts at redefining the franchise felt clunky and forced. The film did not build towards the beats within the story and failed to build tension effectively. The emotional pay offs within the story were not executed  effectively and left the story feeling empty and disjointed. This movie contains an entire 1st\/2nd act sequence that is both irrelevant and tacky. Characters were robbed of major moments and existing characters felt unfaithful to their existing nature. In short this movie fell very short of the bar and was highly self indulgent.","true":true}
