Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad movie destroys characters\\, space battles became a joke hello ftl ram lol good bye death star and any other large ship\\, mary poppins leah\\, no more jedi\\, you can be powerfull without any training\\, mary sue ray sue\\, admiral gender studies\\, rose tico\\n\\ndont believe the critics review its rigged and most of it just tells you \\\"based on my feelings its good\\\" basically without any \\\"valid\\\" reason explaining how it is good\\, just look around the net.","true":true}
