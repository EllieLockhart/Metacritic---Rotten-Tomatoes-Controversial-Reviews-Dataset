Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bold\\, confident\\, often funny\\, with some emotionally fulfilling and unexpected payouts\\, The Last Jedi will prove to be one of the best in the series once dust settles and the movie nestles comfortably into the established lore of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
