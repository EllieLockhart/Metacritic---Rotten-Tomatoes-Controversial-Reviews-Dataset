Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m going to make this review short and simple\\, this has been made into something that just doesn\u2019t feel like Star Wars\\, they transformed Luke into a different character\\, got rid off smoke just like that\\, failed to deliver on a good answer to who Rey\u2019s parents are\\, etc. I literally think the force awakens and even the phantom menace are a million times better than this piece of crap labeled as a Star Wars film.","true":true}
