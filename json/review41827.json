Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is so sloppily made. it's a series of unrelated scenes where characters make decisions based on plot needs\\, almost nothing is achieved\\, every move to make things better ends up making things work\\, and there is political commentary that's as subtle as a sledgehammer","true":true}
