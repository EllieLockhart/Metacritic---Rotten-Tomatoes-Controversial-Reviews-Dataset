TLOU 2 is an expensive game made by talented people who were all laboring towards a bad idea. As a result\\, TLOU 2 is just a bad game. PARTS of it are outstanding. But the parts can never escape the whole. Ultimately TLOU2 feels pointless. It's characters are the weakest element. They all seem created to feel like \\\"real people\\\"\\, but are slavishly tied to a thread of \\\"fate\\\" that feels often inexplicable.  The romance between Ellie and her love interest feels most egregious because the characters relationship advances like a rocket against the least romantic backdrop imaginable.  When Ellie casually calls her partner \\\"babe\\\" and casually works in an affirmation of \\\"love\\\"\\, I was like... \\\"what?!?\\\". It's the script trying to go someplace that's completely unearned despite trying SO VERY HARD. And that's the main criticism with the writing of TLOU2. It's trying EXTREMELY hard to do... SOMEthing. But just what is inexplicable.\r\rTLOU2 is a perfect example of why narrative games shouldn't be so expensive (to produce). It hurts to have to call them out for not living up to the expense.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
