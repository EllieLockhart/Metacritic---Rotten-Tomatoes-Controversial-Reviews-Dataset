Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 2 and saw the original at a drive-in in 1977. While this isn't my favorite Star Wars movie\\, I certainly like how it shook things up within the saga.  \\nI have some minor quibbles\\, I think the Canto Bright subplot had some pacing and story issues\\, for example\\, but this is a worthy installment.","true":true}
