Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director said he made this movie in the spirit of George Lucas\\, and he certainly managed to re-create the lack of humor and interest as in Star Wars 1\\, 2\\, and 3. Plus\\, I thought we were done seeing Luke whining after he answered the call of the Hero in episode 4\\, but there he was yelling \\\"Go away! Leave me Alone\\, over and over again. I believe the humor from Star Wars found in 4\\, 5\\, 6 was largely due to Lawrence Kasdan\\, who wrote the humor into it\\, and who was responsible for the humorously playful banter in the Indiana Jones series\\, like he did between Han and Laya. Movies like these simply cannot take themselves too seriously or they break down. Humor keeps it on an even keel\\, but there was too little of it in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.","true":true}
