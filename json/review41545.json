Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is embarrassingly awful. Disney has finally ruined the Star Wars franchise. Visually it's pretty spectacular but the writing is just so bad. Giant plot holes\\, nothing explained\\, and they ruined Luke Skywalker. It ultimately felt like there were about three movies compressed into one and I was being rushed through it. I thought The Force Awakens was pretty good\\, Rogue One was where the wheels started to fall off\\, and this one was just a complete disaster. How this thing got 91% on the Tomatometer completely blows my mind. I will no longer trust that as a legitimate source for movie ratings.","true":true}
