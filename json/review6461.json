Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney\\, you done fucked up.  I'd rather watch Looper than R\u00edan Johnson's version of Star Wars.  There must have been a conversation that went like this:\\n\\nJJ Abrams:  So I pretty much set up all these plot lines for you.  Just go with it.\\n\\nRian Johnson: (smiling and nodding) Nah\\, fuck it.  I think I'm just gonna wing it.  Force this.  Force that.  Got it.","true":true}
