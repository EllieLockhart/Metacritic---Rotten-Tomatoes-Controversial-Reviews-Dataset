Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's not as bad as people are making it. Sure story-wise they made some dumb decisions\\, and the marketing campaign for this game was a complete joke and mislead tons of fans\\, but the overall experience with this game was pretty solid.

Funny enough the emotions you feel while playing this game are completely intended\\, and the way the story is structured is also completely intentional. This is a game that's supposed to make you feel empty after playing. The visuals in this game are extremely realistic\\, from the facial expressions to the beautiful lighting. This game is a spectacle to behold. The gameplay is definitely better than its predecessor\\, and it's always a blast to engage different enemies through many different methods\\, from up close and personal to sneaking your way through the various situations. The voice acting is very superb\\, with everybody delivering great performances. Even though the story was very misleading via promotional material\\, I still really liked the narrative of the game. The game really plays with your emotions and really embraces the idea of points of view. The way it was executed was phenomenal. It makes actions you enjoyed making earlier in the game take a full 180. Overall\\, a great experience and a must play for all fans.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
