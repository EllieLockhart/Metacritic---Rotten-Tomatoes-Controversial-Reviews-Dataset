Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To those who review this movie so poorly\\, you Star Wars heretics. Do not even bother to call yourself fans of the saga. You missed the point of the whole movie. You beckoned for a movie that was a copy and paste of Empire\\, you got it. This movie did take themes from ESB and ROJ\\, but flipped them on their head and gave you something new. Then\\, they took the Skywalker saber and broke it\\, intentionally. This is no longer the same story\\, from now\\, everything you knew or thought you knew is different\\, and that is wherein the beauty of the movie lies. The only markdown it receives from me is the forced (pun intended) jokes.","true":true}
