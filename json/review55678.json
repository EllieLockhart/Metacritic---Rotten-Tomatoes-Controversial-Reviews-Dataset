Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok.. first of all.. GREAT MOVIE! I can see why some people didn't like it.. I get it.. they didn't show Rey training that much which was sort of a bummer.. and It seemed like Finn might have had a crush on another's girl besides Rey.. but that's just part of the story! I don't think that we should only focus on the not so good parts of a story and start calling the whole story bad because of them.. i mean.. Rey was freaking legit! And I personally don't think that Rose and Finn are a 'thing'... finn obviously is in love with Rey.. and I know.. he and rose kissed (but she was kissing him.. not vise versa)  also! Haha the whole leia flying is space thing was pretty... wack.. honestly though.. I like do the movie a lot.. and I think it's sad how a few 'mistakes throughout the movie could change someone's whole outlook on Star Wars and make them not like the movies any more.. Star Wars is still great (for anyone 'for real' hating on Star Wars right now).. I hope that you can rethink it and have some slack about it.. because.. why not! ITS STAR WARS??????","true":true}
