Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The shift away from dark and light\\, Sith and Jedi brings a new dimension to the franchise. Luke's flaws only reinforce why he can bring peace to the galaxy but also bring chaos back to it and paves a way for the new heroes to learn from these mistakes and save the galaxy once more. The excellent writing accompanied by powerful visuals makes this movie a real treat.","true":true}
