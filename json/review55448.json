Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. This movie turns the heroic journey on its head\\, although not to any great purpose\\, other than to create buzz as far as I can see. No one seems to actually learn anything. And Yoda... WTH? I mean\\, really... WTH? Nothing about him or that scene made sense. Apparently the afterlife makes you act really goofy. Poor Chewie gets robbed (again) and has to play second fiddle comedy relief to some pretty odd CGs. (Those teeth... *shudder*.) And all the male characters seem to be intrinsically flawed while the female characters are practically saints. The SW Universe needed more strong female characters\\, but not at the expense of all the male characters. (Say\\, why did the rebellion attract all these women over the years\\, but the First Order is almost entirely men? There's Phasma and... there's Phasma\\, and... hmm.) On the plus side there were some nice battle scenes. Whoever though the lightsaber battle was great really\\, really needs to watch the later Clone Wars seaonns. Rey and Kylo played off other really well. The Snoke death and Leia savior scenes were hilarious\\, although I don't think they were intended to be. But\\, overall\\, meh.","true":true}
