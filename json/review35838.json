Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is possibly the best Episode of the Star Wars Universe. From the opening scroll to the end credits\\, TLJ is action-packed and visually stunning. The acting in this movie is the best we've seen from Star Wars\\, and Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill give their best performances as Leia and Luke. The story itself is superb\\, and a central theme of failure consistently challenges and humanizes all of the main characters. The biggest cameo in the middle of the movie can be overlooked because of an \\\"awe\\\" factor\\, but it ties the entire story together in more ways than one. The last act provides some of the best and most exciting moments that rival the best scenes from \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and \\\"Return of the Jedi.\\\" Rian Johnson created a masterpiece.","true":true}
