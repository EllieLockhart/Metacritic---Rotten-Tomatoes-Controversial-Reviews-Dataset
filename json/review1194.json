Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A phenomenal continuation of the Star Wars series\\, that will most likely diving fans because it answers most of your questions but it may not be what you where expecting. As Luke says \\\"this is not going to go the way you think\\\" is very true. The Last Jedi is better than The Force Awakens but not as good as The Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope\\, but sitting very good as the third best in the franchise!","true":true}
