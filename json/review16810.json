Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In short: I am a big star wars fan - but after the last jedi - not so much\\, it really ruins a lot of the characters and lore.\\n\\nThe visual effects and way the movie looks is amazing which is why it gets a 1.5\\, unfortunately\\, everything else is terrible. The biggest issue with this movie is the way the characters are written\\, I am not sure how any one could defend it\\, even if you take away how Luke was treated the new characters have no real development. The second issue is that the film does not feel like the second movie in the series\\, the reason for this is that much of the threads that were left in The Force Awakens are not picked up\\, and those that are used are completed in very disappointing ways. I am not really sure what there is to look forward to for Episode 9. Finally the plot for this movie and the story is bad - there is no epic moments in it and when you think something is going to be epic something will happen like a bad joke or the person isn't really there or something.","true":true}
