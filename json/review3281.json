Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a fan since I can remember. SW is dead now dead to me. This movie killed it\\, the least effort possible was put into it. Rian Johnson has absolutely no idea about the franchise and the lore\\, or even worse he just didn't care\\, neither about the work nor the fans.\\n\\nAnd the worst of all\\, is that instead of acknowledging the fact that mistakes were made\\, they will keep in denial and will keep thrwing garbage out.\\n\\nJust check how from June 10th on these reviews page they released hundreds of 5-star bots. Childish and shameful.","true":true}
