Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not quite sure I get the hate. This was an amazing film. It takes the franchise into entirely new directions\\, with new heroes charting their own paths and breaking past the formula into its very own\\, exactly what Empire did back in the day. I believe most of the haters are spoiled (older) children from the '70s who need to grow up and understand that these movies weren't made for them. Just stay home and rewatch the original trilogy if you want recycled dog food!","true":true}
