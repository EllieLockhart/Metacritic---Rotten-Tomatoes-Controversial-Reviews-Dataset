Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off. The fault falls on Kathleen Kennedy\\, for providing no direction to this trilogy. Each director is making their own individual free for all movie\\, and it shows. TLJ was a 2+ hour movie of meaningless tasks\\, which did little to advance the plot. The only item this film accomplished was forcibly destroy the franchise\u2019s history\\, vice letting it naturally progress through good writing. As for the Star Wars universe\\, aside from a few destroyed ships and one positional change\\, very little changed from before\/after the movie. The worst and most irrelevant movie of the franchise.","true":true}
