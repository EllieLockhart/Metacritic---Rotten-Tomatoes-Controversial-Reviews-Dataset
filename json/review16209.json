Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I missed the chance to see it in the theatres. So when it became available to purchase\\, I didn't give it a second thought and bought it. After watching it\\, I feel like crying. My hard earned money gone. This movie is a fraud\\, a scam\\, an insult to the original Star Wars series and to thier fans.\\n\\nFrom untalented actor devoid of basic charisma\\, dead boring dialogue\\, storyline which is mediocre at best\\, to barely 5-6 swings of lightsabers\\, this movie is such a disappointment; it is like being fed a pie labeled \\\"wagyu beef\\\" with nothing but saw dust inside. You keep eating it thinking maybe there will be a piece of beef at the end just to discover it's just manure in the core.\\n\\nI was expecting an epic Sabre duel at the end between two characters. There goes my $24.99 down in the crapper.","true":true}
