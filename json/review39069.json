Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This absolute piece of crap movie shouldn't even be considered Star Wars canon. The \\\"Top Critics\\\" should be ashamed of themselves giving this turd a fresh rating. \\n\\n\\\"We can't offend Disney! Uhhh... 5 stars!\\\"\\n-Pretty much every \\\"Top Critic\\\" on this website\\n\\nThere are so many things wrong with this movie\\, I don't know where to begin. Awful. Just... Awful.","true":true}
