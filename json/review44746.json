Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash movie. Nothing more than a cash grab by Disney. Although there were many stupid and wtf moments that damaged the movie\\, the lack of plot  and one specific \\\"jump the shark\\\" moment really sent that point home. I've been fearing fort years what Disney may do to things like star wars and marvel\\, high production low value movies made to sell quick tickets ater here.","true":true}
