Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it weren't for being linked to the mega franchise\\, this movie would have been a colossal failure. Tons of segments that should have been cut out.  The movie dragged on for nearly an hour after the excellent snoke ending.  In general the writing was thin and reaching for side stories\\, and the humor was so forced and unnatural.","true":true}
