Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie!! This movie had amazing acting\\, the CGI looked amazing and the humor in it was good. I hate seeing this movie get panned because they added a couple new characters and Luke getting killed off. I thought the way that Luke was killed off was very heroic and amazing!! Luke really didn't have a purpose anymore to stick around\\, what else would you expect him to do?? People that watch these movies always expect a perfect Star Wars movie that lives up to their expectations and don't focus on what the other people want to see. Overall\\, this movie was awesome in my opinion.","true":true}
