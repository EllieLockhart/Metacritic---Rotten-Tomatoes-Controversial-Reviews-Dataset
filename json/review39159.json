Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode did follow the theme from empire strikes back it did not keep up the same tone. Throughout the movie it felt more like a comedy than a more serious Star Wars movie. In addition there where many questionable choices made and left me with an uneasy feeling. The characters feel like they only react to everything and don\u2019t have that great character interaction that they tended to have in the OT. I\u2019d also like to point out that the score for this movie is lower than the prequels","true":true}
