Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has destroyed me I can't beleive someone took Star Wars\\, STAR WARS! And made it this shit SNOKE what the fuck LUKE is a fucking embarrassment and the worst lightsaber battles the galaxy has ever seen people calling this fresh and reinventing are fucking delusional it's boring and utter shit.","true":true}
