Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've gotta say\\, I have no idea how this film scored a 90% without payola going out to a lot of professional reviewers. As a movie it is poorly edited with my story problems. There is no flow to the overall story and aside from the core 4 (Rey\\, Poe\\, Kylo\\, and Finn) characters all characters have little to no development. There are a ton of ill fitting cringe worthy jokes. All in all it is just baffling.\\n\\nThere are fun individual scenes and the third act is relatively good but none of this is enough to save the movie as whole.\\n\\n\\nWatching this it is clear that it was produced by committee rather than organically. I'd say stay away but obviously no one is.","true":true}
