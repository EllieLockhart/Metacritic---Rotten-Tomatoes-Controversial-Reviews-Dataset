Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"-The movie kept subverting the plot making any build up of emotion or expectation useless\\n-Phasma was irrelevant\\n- Comedy was bullshit\\n-Villains were too easily defeated\\n- Chase scenes were pointless\\n- Lightspeed rules were thrown out the window\\n-too much political messaging","true":true}
