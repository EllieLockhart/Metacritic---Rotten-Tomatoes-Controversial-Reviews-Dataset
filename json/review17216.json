Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved this film. This film is ballsy and the choices that Rian Johnson made were fantastic. I think seeing an older more war torn Luke; cause he\u2019s been through some shit and the choices he made are great. I loved it all. I have some nit picky things with it like some of the Rose\/Finn story and Canto Bight but... the positive outweighs the negative\\, but that\u2019s my opinion and I am a hardcore Star Wars fan.","true":true}
