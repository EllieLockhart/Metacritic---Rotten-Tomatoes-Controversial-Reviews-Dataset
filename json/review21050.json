Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really disappointed in this movie. I would rate it the lowest among all star wars movies at this point. The plot was all over the place and hard to follow. Characters old and new behaved and were presented in ways totally out of sync with previous appearances.  The action scenes were choppy and didn't make sense in context of the story. There was really no part I enjoyed.","true":true}
