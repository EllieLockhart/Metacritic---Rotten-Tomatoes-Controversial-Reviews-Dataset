Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved TFA but this took everything that movie teed up and messed it up royally. There were several prequel level BAD parts -  Leia as Peter Pan\\, Canto Bight and Broom kid at the end among the culprits. I actually didn't find any of the plot twists particularly shocking. There was certainly no \\\"I am your father moment\\\". I wish just wish it had been madder\\, wilder and darker. Instead it felt toothless. Big Bummer. After 40 years i'm not excited for the next episode anymore :(","true":true}
