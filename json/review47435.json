Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What ever were they thinking? This movie is almost as bad as the Lucas pre-qual movies\\, some aspects are actually worse. I can only assume whomever wrote the script\\, was either aiming to flip the bird at fans or has never watched the original movies. Rey is back again dazzling us with her awesome unexplainable Mary Sue abilities. Luke Skywalker is nowhere to be seen. I mean yeah Hamill is in the movie but whom ever he was meant to be playing certainly didn't resemble Skywalker. I was soo hoping this would be an improvement over Force Awakens but it's worse. At least the former plagiarised New Hope and felt oddly familiar. Everytime I saw a cuddly creature\\, I could hear George Lucas wallet going ka-ching at the future sale of plush toys. The pivot of the movie hindged on such a rediculous concept\\, that it contradicts Newton's first law. Anything travelling in space will not slow down just because it runs out of fuel!! But don't let that get in the way of a completely pointless plot complication.\\n\\nI'll finish this on the subject that irked me most. The most pointless death ever! Disney you suck!","true":true}
