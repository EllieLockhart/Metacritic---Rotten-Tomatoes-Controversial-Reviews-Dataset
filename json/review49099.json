Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars Movie Ever... I'm a huge fan of all the material related to Star Wars\\, this was a kick in the nuts in each aspect. I have a Top 5 that I can rescue from the movie\\, and a Top 15 Why I hate this movie!\\nThis is not a Star Wars Film\\, this is something else\\, and as something else maybe is not the worst film in story\\, is an average film\\, but as a Star Wars film is the worst in my opinion\\, the director take a concept and try to create something new\\, that is average\\, but you can't take Star Wars and try to create something new\\, in this I will say \\\"Do not\\, there is no try\\\"","true":true}
