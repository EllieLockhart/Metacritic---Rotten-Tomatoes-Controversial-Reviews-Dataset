Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For anyone who loved Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\, but felt the plot was too similar to A New Hope\\, you are in for a delight. The Last Jedi is true to the style and atmosphere of the Star Wars universe and yet brings new surprises and twists. It's deeply adventurous\\, moving\\, and thrilling. \\nThe introduction of new characters adds depth to the universe\\, and they are immediately likable and provide tantalizing jumping-off points for future stories - more Star Wars realms to explore!","true":true}
