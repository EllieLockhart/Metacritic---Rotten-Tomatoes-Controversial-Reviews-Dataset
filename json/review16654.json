Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly dumb or lazy script...Logic is just non-existent. It's a cheese-fest\\, full of lame attempts at humor. Just straight up ridiculous scenes that disrespect main characters. We also discover there are too many pointless characters in these new Star Wars episodes. Summing it up\\, it was another Hollywood bs movie built on the lowest common denominator treating people like dumb atm's\\, who can't see pass the special effects and good visuals...honestly there are too many bad points and scenes for me to write about here...i should've just pirated this movie when it's in hd quality. And btw\\, i hated Justice League\\, but when Justice League gets 40% from \\\"expert critics\\\" and this garbage movie apart from the visuals get's a 93%?????!!!...Disney must really treat them well\\, or they (the expert reviewers) just have no idea what they're doing.","true":true}
