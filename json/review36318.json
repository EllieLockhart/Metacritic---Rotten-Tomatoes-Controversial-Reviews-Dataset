Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The main issue with this movie is what they've done to Luke Skywalker\\, the writers and film makers have literally destroyed his character. Mark Hamill knew it himself and we have plenty of evidence of him telling pretty much anyone who will listen that this is not 'his' Luke Skywalker. Character development is generally weak within this film with characters shoehorned with little backstory or development. \\n\\nIn terms of positive points\\, Carrie Fisher puts in a wonderful final performance as Leia. It's a sad that she cannot help to carry the final film\\, she really put herself into this film. The scenes with Snokes chamber are also entertaining. He's certainly not the Emperor but he certainly is the enjoyable to watch - unfortunately we never learn his backstory\\, feels like we never will.","true":true}
