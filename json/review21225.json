Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this in the theater then rented at home\\, through here and all the negative reviews are from people who did not understand this movie\\, or did not want it to go their way. This movie is way better than I thought watching it the second time\\, without all the preconceived biases I had because of all the negativity around it. Watching it with an open mind\\, not only is this a great movie\\, but it is most defiantly a Star Wars movie and holds true to the Star Wars paradigm! Don't let the naysayers distract you from watching this great movie and forming a preconceived bias against it. Rotten Tomatoes has the critics at 91% saying it is a great movie\\, and they are right!","true":true}
