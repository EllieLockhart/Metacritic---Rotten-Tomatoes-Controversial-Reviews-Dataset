Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the most conflicted I've been after seeing a Star Wars movie. On one hand\\, TLJ has the best cinematography\\, best character development\\, best action sequences and most unpredictable plot out of the ENTIRE saga. It's a fantastic stand alone movie\\, made by an extremely talented directed and cast. The plot is like nothing you will ever dream of expecting\\, taking place in what might be the most beautiful sci-fi backdrop ever made. The writing was sharp (for a Star Wars movie)\\, and the humor felt balanced and tastefully done. The risks they took in this movie greatly expanded on Star Wars lore and namely took the interpretation of the force in a very interesting direction. On the other hand\\, it is a terrible follow up to 2015 The Force Awakens. It has taken the relatively tame plot of TFA and has butchered it\\, leaving way more questions than answers in its place. This is a huge reason for why there are so many negative audience reviews for this movie. However\\, until the next one in the series comes out\\, I don't think it's fair to rate this movie on how it ties in to the saga. If the next chapter can answer some of the long standing questions raised by TFA (which this movie literally answers none of)\\, it has the potential to be on par or even surpass Empire as the best Star Wars movie ever made. For the reason that this is an unfinished story\\, I will base my score off the movie in itself. For the wonderful performances\\, character development\\, cinematography\\, music\\, unique plot\\, and for blowing my f***ing mind for 2 and half hours (literally had this face :o the entire movie)\\, I'm going to give this a 9\/10...with a huge asterisk. It lost a point for (SPOILERS AHEAD): giving a meaningless subplot from Finn and Rose in Casino World so much screen time. For showing that absurd space flying Leia scene. For not making Leia the one to lights peed sacrifice herself against the first order fleet instead of Laura Dern's character- which would have given her a worthy send off and removed the addition of an ultimately useless character. And lastly for not giving answers to the pivitol questions raised by TFA: who is Snoke and the First Order?\\, why did Kylo Ren turn dark?\\, why did Kylo hate his parents?\\, why is there even a map to Luke Skywalker in the first place?\\, how did Rey pick up her force powers so easily?\\, how did the galaxy respond to five major planets being incinerated? ect. (P.S I know I said 9\/10\\, but I'm giving this 5 stars because too many people gave this one or zero ratings\\, which is just dumb. If you didn't like the movie\\, at least review it realistically (2\\, 2.5\\, 3 stars) than just giving it a zero. )","true":true}
