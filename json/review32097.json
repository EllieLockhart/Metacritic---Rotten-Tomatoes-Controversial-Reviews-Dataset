Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers: Overall\\, it was a pretty awesome movie. One of the best light saber battles of all time when Rey and Kylo team up. But I agree that they built up Snoke as the big bad guy just randomly kill him off early in the movie. Kind of lame. Luke's character got some redemption at the end of the movie\\, but his role was pretty weak for the first half. ","true":true}
