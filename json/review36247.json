Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE LAST JOKE - They turned one of the greatest heroes ever into a coward who couldn't train Rey couldn't face snoke 1v1 and couldn't even face kylo ren 1 v 1 he was soft arse and Star Wars has gone soft as for the film it was all literally pointless and it seemed like it was written and directed by 20 different ideas and they where all under 7 years old all the e old characters are dieing and being portrayed as crap and the new ones great then again snoke and captain plasma are a joke as well it's COULD have been great and just","true":true}
