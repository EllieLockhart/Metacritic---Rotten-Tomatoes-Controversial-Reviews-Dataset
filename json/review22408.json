Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Leaving aside the bizarre choices made in this film\\, it doesnt even work on its own terms. This is a sequel\\, yet plot points established in the previous film are abandoned or ignored. There's no continuity even within the film itself. Characters do and say half-baked things that contradict what we already know about them. Cringe-worthy jokes fall flat and give everyone a inappropriate\\, bipolar vibe. Two plot strands are merged despite one seemingly lasting minutes and the other lasting weeks. Characters forget things that they knew in their previous scene. It is an utter mess\\, a confused\\, disjointed headache. I'll never trust a film critic again.","true":true}
