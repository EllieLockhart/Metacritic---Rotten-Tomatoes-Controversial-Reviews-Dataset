The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As the fun of the first game\\, I realize that TLOU games are plot-driven. In the sequel\\, Neil Druckmann made revenge and retribution main themes of the game. However\\, notion that violence begets only further violence isn't groundbreaking in storytelling. It corresponds to Druckmann's writing style: \\\"simple story\\, complex characters\\\". In spite of this\\, I believe that there are only two well written personages\\, whose goals and motivation are perfectly explained: Abby and Tommy. It's hard to compare Yara and Lev to Sam and Henry\\, since the first pair has got far more screen time. As for the rest of the characters\\, such as Dina\\, Jesse\\, Owen\\, Mel\\, Manny and Nora I didn't feel a lot of emotional investment in them. Nevertheless\\, as far as I am concerned\\, the biggest drawback of the sequel is its plot. I want to highlight two moments\\, which were the most controversial for me. The first one is the ambush in the hotel\\, where Abby told Ellie that WLF let her and Tommy live and they \\\"wasted it\\\"\\, because this duo killed Abby's friends. However\\, this scene is built on the false premise: Ellie asked all of the aforementioned people to tell her Abby's location and everyone refused and tried to kill her instead. The second plot twist that devastated me was final fight between Abby and Ellie. The fact that Ellie forgives her enemy and allows her to escape was supposed to show Ellie's character growth\\, it meant to be a parallel to her attempt to forgive Joel and also she saw Abby as the last protector of Lev\\, whereas the same could be applied to her and Joel in the first game. Whilst I think that it's a wonderful idea\\, it diminishes the values of nearly a hundred individuals Ellie killed on her revenge quest. The vast majority of these people were not directly related to Joel's execution\\, but they paid with their lives. On the other hand\\, the person\\, who organized this operation is shown mercy. In my opinion there are two ways to faithfully deliver following idea. Firstly\\, allow Ellie to eliminate Abby and Lev\\, then show that now she is hunted by Lev's death too and Dina abandons her. In this scenario\\, Ellie will have her revenge\\, but there will be no satisfaction from it. Furthermore\\, she will be alone and the audience knows it's her greatest fear. Second option is to let Ellie live in the farm with Dina nurturing JJ\\, yet she still suffers from PTSD and has to struggle to live peacefully\\, since Ellie is afraid that sooner or later the violence will erupt again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
