Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Something fishy is going on with the critic score.  The split among friends who did and didn't like this film is about 50\/50\\, and as time is passing the other review sites are headed that way as well.  The \\\"russian hacker\\\" explanation for the low audience score is looking less and less likely as more people weigh in. The coming weeks should tell us a lot about what people really think\\, but I expect attendance to plummet. \\n\\nSPOILERS - That the boy who risked everything to save his father\\, the worst villain in the galaxy\\, would become a man who would consider murdering his nephew while he slept\\, instead of helping him though the darkness he would face\\, because that would be too hard to do\\, makes absolutely no sense. That he would then run off and hide\\, leaving that same child to murder his father\\, expressing no remorse\\, making no attempt to help\\, and showing no real concern for his sister in the face of all that was happening\\, makes even less.\\n  For a telepathic villain of vast power\\, who has been playing with the minds of the two standing before without them even knowing to be suddenly surprised that an apprentice would betray his master (the entire history of the dark side)\\, or forget that the force could be used to move a lightsaber\\, is unbelievable. He has apparently been manipulating Ben since childhood (though that wasn't important enough to go into any detail about\\, we needed to spend half the movie being reminded that war is bad on the casino planet)\\, so unless it was a trick and he secretly lives on\\, his death in this way is just silly.\\n  The nonsensical fleet chase\\, the second most powerful villain being phone pranked\\, super Leia creating an entirely new force power (will Rey learn to fly now?)\\, the incredibly convoluted yet ultimately pointless side story to take out the tracking device\\, Yoda showing up to force lightning a hut to keep Luke from discovering that the Jedi books had been stolen by Rey\\, but not doing anything to stop the myriad disasters going on throughout the galaxy (including the Luke\/Ben encounter)\\, just frustrating. \\n  Rey jumping into the black hole and learning... nothing... Chewie being ignored by everyone except the penguins he was going to eat\\, then taking them all on board the Falcon...  Really?\\n  The list goes on\\, but I won't. Let the past die? At least in this case I think we are headed that way\\, this is definitely another nail in the coffin of the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
