Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VIII I've seen even twice\\, and I have to say I did not disappoint. I absolutely understand why some people see this episode so controversial\\, but their arguments are odd in my view.\\nI do not think that this part would kill Star Wars fabulous roots. In my opinion\\, he is just shifting away and heading for a new world without his solid pillars\\, trying to replace them with new ones. Of course\\, I mean the original heroes and the new generation. But the basic one remains\\, and it is the struggle between good and evil.\\nIn conclusion\\, we can only say that this part was just such a preparation for the big final\\, and as Luke himself said\\, \\\"The real war is coming yet\\\"\\, and especially the conclusion itself showed unequivocally that the resistance can be defeated but never eradicated because future generations are growing. This is why it would not hurt the episode IX if it happened ten years later from episode VIII.","true":true}
