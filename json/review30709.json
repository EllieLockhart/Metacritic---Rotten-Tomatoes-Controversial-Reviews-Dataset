Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJWs EVERYWHERE!! Politically correctness does not belongin Star Wars\\, the film had way too many scenes that slowed down the movie for a political statement.  Many of the scenes were anticapitalist\\, antimen\\, pro PETA\\, and pro toxic feminism!","true":true}
