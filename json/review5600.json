Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't answer any of the questions set up by the first film felt like they wanted to tell their own story and not build off the previous film. a lot of political gesturing in the movie too which sucks. overall I didn't like it","true":true}
