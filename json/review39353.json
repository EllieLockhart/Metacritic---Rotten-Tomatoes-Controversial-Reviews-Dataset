Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is completely different and a stretch from original Star Wars films. It is a spontaneous movie that did leave plot holes but recreated the repeated elements of a Star Wars movie into a modernized and unique film. \\nAs a Star Wars film\\, it is not ordinary and therefore is not appealing to fans who admire the original take on Star Wars. But\\, this film showed an interesting spin on the saga that opened up the platform for a new generation and a new crowd of people. In general\\, the film was impressive and intriguing with amazing elements with some lack of plot development.","true":true}
