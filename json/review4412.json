Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Casino and \\\"race horses\\\" was garbage. Finn might as well not been in and the forced comedy in the first scene was so laboured. Some great scene but mostly disappointing. Screw the critics they are useless.","true":true}
