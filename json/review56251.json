Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, Is half of a great movie\\, that is unfortunately bogged down by a subplot that serves no purpose to the film. \\n\\nThe scenes of Rey and Kylo Ren slowly coming to a understanding of one another were phenomenal\\, and really convinced me that these two characters (which should hate each other) could grow to care for one another. And the climactic battle in Snoke's throne room\\, was excellently choreographed\\, while showing how well Rey and Kylo could work together. \\n\\nHowever a disgusting amount of this films run time (2h 33m) Is devoted to Rose and Finn's pointless rescue attempt of the resistance  fleet. The opening of the film sets up a time limit for the destruction of the fleet\\, and creates a meaningless conflict between Fan favorite Poe Dameron\\, and the Idiotic newcomer Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo.  Both of which\\, refuse to share details of their stupidly simple plans which leads to one of the most boring sequence of events in all of film history.  And I am completely serious\\, when I say that 99% of my problems with this movie are in direct relation to Finn's new \\\"love interest\\\" Rose Tico.\\n\\nThe events go as follow; Finn and Rose leave the resistance fleet\\, to go find a guy\\, which they bring back to Snoke's ship(which has been pursuing them)\\, where they both get caught\\, guy betrays them\\, and they return to the fleet. Nothing changes about the story\\, and throughout all of this pointless escapade Rose is determined to be the most unlikable character in the entire movie. \\n\\n- She is underdeveloped\\n\\n- They keep focusing on her connection to her sister (who dies in the opening scene) with ought having any emotional payoff\\n\\n- She's preachy\\n\\n- Uninteresting\\n\\n- And shares no chemistry with Finn despite being \\\"In love with him\\\" by the end of the film\\n\\nNothing about this character is enjoyable\\, yet they insist on cutting away from the Genuinely enjoyable scenes of Rey's journey to becoming a Jedi\\, to focus on this boring nothing character.\\n\\nI know that I've been focusing mostly on the negative parts of this film\\, but there is a genuinely enjoyable story that feels bogged down by the most pointless and uninteresting subplot in all of cinematic history. I give this movie five stars\\, based solely on the promise I made to myself\\, to find a version of this film that I can edit to remove the unnecessary parts of this Film.\\n\\nRey and Kylo 9\/10\\n Finn And Rose 2\/10","true":true}
