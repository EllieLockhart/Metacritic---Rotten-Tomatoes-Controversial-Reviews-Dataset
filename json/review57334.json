Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is such trash I had to create an account here to rate it 1\/2 a star. Maybe the most let down I have ever been\\, wow just awful. For all the people who are writing off complaints of this film as nothing more than fanboys that are impossible to please\\, you need to take an honest look at this movie. The plot is laughably stupid\\, so many holes in it. They went completely out of their way to trash the most iconic aspects of star wars and for what? To make the point it\u2019s time to move on? Umm the world did move on YOU DECIDED TO BRING IT BACK. What is the point of bringing something like star wars back if you have no intention of adding anything of value to the story? In retrospect I think the biggest mistake they made with this trilogy was incorporating the old characters. They should have made the movie 100 years in the future and made it have nothing to do with the skywalker saga they are so eager to take a dump all over. I could go into the plot holes and reasons why every subplot didn\u2019t even need to take place but so many people on here have done a fantastic job of doing that already. I have no idea where they take this steaming pile of crap story line from here and frankly do not care. Im done with star wars and indeed it is time to move on. ","true":true}
