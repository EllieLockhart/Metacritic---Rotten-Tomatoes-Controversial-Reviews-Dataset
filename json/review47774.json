Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When this movie's on\\, it's Empire Strikes Back good\\, but at other times it is Phantom Menace bad. This is mainly because of a lot of silly elements and ridiculous scenes. When the film is suspenseful though\\, it is amazing. I am surprised it has received such horrible ratings\\, I still thought it was a good movie.","true":true}
