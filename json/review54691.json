Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, the latest installment in the Star Wars franchise. But it's by no means a great film. It has flat points and plot holes but it's exciting and thrilling in parts. I think Rian Johnson has done a fine job in keeping the franchise fresh and relevant. In all honesty the only two great Star Wars films were the first two made. They are superbly constructed thrilling adventure films. The rest are a mixed bag. This one falls above the prequels and I think is roughly on par with The Force Awakens. The story naturally moves on from that film with the First Order trying to destroy the rebellion once again. Rei is away to learn from Luke Skywalker (The Last Jedi) while Kylo Ren is battling his demons in serving the dark side of the force. There are new characters introduced with my favourite being the codebreaker played by Benicio Del Toro. Often I find it's the 'minor' Star Wars characters who add a lot to these films. And of course all of the strange and wild beasts that we see. There are plenty of new ones in this one to enjoy\\, especially the Porgs. A weakness I think has always been Mark Hamill\\, an actor who has great limitations. Especially for such a central role. Of course the action sequences are spectacular and the finale is quite thrilling and explosive. Making for an enjoyable time at the cinema if not a hugely memorable one.","true":true}
