Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have just spent a considerable amount of money and an entire night\\, dusk until dawn\\, heading to\\, watching and heading back from Star Wars Episode 8.\\n\\nDon't watch this film.\\n\\nDon't waste your money\\, don't waste your time\\, don't give them your support. The film is clearly a mash up of two scripts\\, one written by a decent writer who understands Star Wars\\, the other by a hack who seems to neither appreciate nor understand the franchise. Unfortunately\\, for whatever reason\\, Disney let the hack win.\\n\\nAs a result\\, the ending makes no sense and the whole film is a disjointed mess.\\n\\nMark Hamill did a fantastic job and deserves every credit given him. It's just a pity he was lumped with a film directed by someone who seems to have a pathological hatred for his character.\\n\\nAs a result of this film\\, I'm pretty much out of taking part in anything to do with the new trilogy. I will not be buying any ep 8 merchandise\\, nor its DVD\\, I will not watch it again\\, even for free.\\n\\nNot will I make any particular effort to watch episode 9 unless either there are rave reviews from actual fans of they solemnly promise to retcon most of this film from the start.\\n\\nI really wish I didn't have to write this\\, but the complete mess they have made forces me to do so.","true":true}
