The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Metacritc removed my review on my old account because of its \\\"content\\\" and I suspect they've been using that excuse to remove a lot of other negative reviews because this game does not deserve a 4.9. Metacritic\\, do not remove my review again. Ive heard a lot of people saying \\\"This game doesn't deserve a 10\/10 but it definitely doesn't desrve a 0\/10\\\" fs Naughty Dog flat out lied to you during the marketing for the game\\, they abused their staff to the point of hospitalisation and they issued false copyright claims on youtube channels who merely discussed the leaks\\, which is illegal btw. So yeah\\, as far as i am concerned this game has truely earned its 0 out of 10For the record\\, i went into this game with an open mind and did not look at the leaks as i was hyped for the game. I completed the game from start to finish and so did everyone who are giving this game the **** reviews it deserves and anyone saying people are giving this game the terrible reviews it deserves because they are homophobic then they definitely didnt play the first game. Because guess what? Ellie is still gay in that game but everyone still loves her beacuse being gay is her sexuality not her personality unlike in this terrible game. Some of the \\\"good\\\" points about this game that keep coming up are its graphics and gameplay. Like i mentioned Naughty Dog abused their staff for years and drove them to quit or end up in hospital. This abuse was the catalyst for the leaks and anyone thinking that some how hackers caused the leaks are **** stupid. So yeah\\, if you work your staff 24 hours a day then the graphics have to be good fs. The gameplay is the exact same as TLOU apart from a **** rope and jump button and the mainstream gaming media were sucking them new features off\\, like fs its a jump and rope addition its not that **** great\u2026 Expand","true":true}
