Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Confused script\\, some characters has no purpose to be in the movie. And there is no enemy\\, the villains in this movie are just for comic relief and do not make a real fear in the movie.","true":true}
