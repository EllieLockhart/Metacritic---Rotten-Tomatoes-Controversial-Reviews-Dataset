Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the worst Star Wars films since the Phantom menace... If you enjoy hand holding\\, on screen characters explaining the movie to you\\, and complete disgregard for any sort of suspense and tension ruined by poorly placed jokes then this is your movie! If not and you're not a child then steer clear. Maybe worth $5 ona. Discount day. \\n\\nA few scenes with some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a Star Wars Film does NOT make up for the awful story and complete lack of respect for the intellect of its audience.","true":true}
