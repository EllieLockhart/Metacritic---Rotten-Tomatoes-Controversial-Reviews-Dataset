Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the critic reviews there is nothing alluring about this movie.  I have a new respect for Jar Jar Binks. Considering this movie is a disaster. There is no flow to the movie.  The lead up to this movie from the force awakens was torn apart by this movie.  Rey is this awesome powerfull user of the force and we have no idea why.  No answeres to Snoke\\, no answers to Rey. No answers to Kylo Ren.  New force skills never seen by anyone in the franchise and no explenation why.  I would usually see the movie in theatre 4 to 5 times.  Will not return and probably wont by it when it comes out.","true":true}
