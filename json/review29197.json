Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Relies on the \\\"this isn't going to end how you think\\\" and never fully develops any characters or sufficiently answers the questions we have been asking. First half of movie I kept asking myself if this was the actual movie. Second half picks up better but just a bad film. I want to like it so bad but just can't :(","true":true}
