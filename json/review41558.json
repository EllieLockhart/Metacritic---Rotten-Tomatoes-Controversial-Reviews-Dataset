Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is extremely flawed and disappointing\\, it's different but different in a bad way to the point of destroying Star Wars. I recommend not wasting money seeing the film but if you do\\, listen to the silence and notice the odd feeling around you as you leave the theater.","true":true}
