Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a giant\\, deep Star Wars fan. I bleed Star Wars. This movie was everything that I wanted from the franchise. I was stunned\\, blown out The Last Jedi\\, in all the best ways. I LOVED this movie. This movie delved into the deeper workings of The Force in ways we have never seen before. Now if you'll excuse me\\, I need to go watch this movie seven more times. ","true":true}
