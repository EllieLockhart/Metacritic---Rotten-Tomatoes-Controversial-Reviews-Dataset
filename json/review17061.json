{"101487":138879,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-11","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi\\, I feel it honored the series really well and set it up for a great finish. Not quite as good as Rogue One however\\, as I felt wanting a little more and there were some plot holes I saw\\, but certainly not as many as The Force Awakens. (Don't you think the bad guys would eventually find a way to build a mega space station that a few fighters can't just blow up?) First of all\\, I thought Mark Hamill did a great job as the old\\, disheveled master. I really did not think he could act very well and wouldn't be able to pull it off. The scene on the ice planet with the First Order battalion all shooting at him was breathtaking. However\\, I wanted to see him use a light saber one last time before he died. I really liked the idea of having the two young kids trying to break the dark side\/light side archetypes and create their own paths\\, I'm excited to see how that finishes. However\\, I want to know more about Snoke\\, what are his origins? How did he acquire his power? What the heck happened to his face? I also really liked the narrative\\, it was neat to see actual battle strategy in a Star Wars film. (besides Rogue One) Because I always thought\\, \\\"Can't you just fly to the other side of the planet? I mean it's huge\\, sounds like it would be easy to hide.\\\" Finally\\, the two things that bothered me the most. First\\, what the heck did Princess Leia do? Where did that come from? Never before did the ability to not explode in deep space appear in a description of Jedi Powers. Also\\, based on recent events\\, it kinda seems pointless. Secondly\\, and more important\\, OMG\\, IF YOU CAN JUST DRIVE A SPACESHIP INTO ANOTHER ONE AT LIGHTSPEED\\, WHAT HAS THIS WHOLE WAR BEEN ABOUT? First of all\\, since it is going above lightspeed\\, it should have infinite inertia\\, so it should probably have created a black hole or something. But couldn't they have done this the whole time? Also\\, I'm sure the have remotes so they can send ships at lightspeed into others without being on the ship. It was visually spectacular but it really bothered me.","true":true}
