Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson was hired to reinvent Star Wars from a meta perspective\\, and that's what he did. I just wish he had done it in a spin-off movie (or three) because now we have a film with great ideas that won't fit in to the larger saga. Especially since it might be the second to last Skywalker story.","true":true}
