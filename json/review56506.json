Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE FORCE LEFT THE FRANCHISE WITH THIS film. it managed to un do everything the Force awakens started. First I will say that it did have good CINEMATOGRAPHY\\, MUSIC\\, acting\\, and action. The shows were BEAUTIFULLY filmed\\, music was on point\\, and all the actors did their best. Now everything else was bad. It had no REVERENCE for the past\\, too many plot holes\\, no continuity with the last film\\, a side quest that derailed the film\\, force political message\\, poor pacing\\, went out of it's way to piss off the fans\\, and worst of all the film was boring. Luke and Leia's characters were butchered beyond RECOGNITION\\, Rey got turned into a merry sue\\, Hux got lobotomized\\, Finn does nothing in the film\\, rose prevents finn from doing anything\\, poe gets screwed over\\, and holdo is the worst character in the film. I get what this film was going for\\, but the delivery left a lot to be desired. i was left with a deeper DISAPPOINTMENT than I got with the Prequels. this film actually made those three films look good by comparison. Instead of being left wanting more\\, i was left not wanting to see another star wars film.","true":true}
