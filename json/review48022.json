Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not perfect\\, especially answering questions suggested from the previous movie as major plot points with bland answers that leave watchers saying why did the previous movie suggest this was a big deal.  The movie is very good.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker who in the previous movie was only a hero\\, shows so much depth and realism.  Without true peers Luke found himself a man who had always been successful\\, but when he makes a tragic mistake he has no peers and closes himself off from everything because he disappointed his closest friends and himself. The movie is a Luke Skywalker triumph... in that a simple hero is brought to life as more than a legend but a real but flawed man dealing with overcoming a mistake.  Mark Hamill should be proud of the performance.","true":true}
