Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know what these people are talking about giving it low scores. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m a huge Star Wars fan\\, but I went with a group of 7 people not all of which were big Star Wars fans like myself\\, and everyone loved it. Yes\\, there are a few quirky moments\\, but certainly no worse than any of the original episodes had. Blows the prequels out of the water so don\u2019t listen to these people rating it poorly. See it with an open mind and you\u2019ll enjoy it. ","true":true}
