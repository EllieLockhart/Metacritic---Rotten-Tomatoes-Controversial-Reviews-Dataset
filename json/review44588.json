Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total hot GARBAGE. Never will I go see another Star Wars movie again. The franchise has saturated the market by producing a movie every year. The story is not consistent and just reused themes from previous Star War movies with a cut and paste job. I think a 5th grade class could have written a better script than what was released. The best inconsequential scene of the movie is milking a four breasted sea walrus and then drinking the milk....lol. They will have to reboot this three part movie to get the franchise back on track.","true":true}
