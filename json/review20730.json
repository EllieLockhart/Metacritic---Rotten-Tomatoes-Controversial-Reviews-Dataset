Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked out of this movie so angry about what they did to Luke\u2019s character I wanted to cry. They made him look like the biggest wimp there ever was. There was no big comeback\\, not even a decent showdown with kylo ren.. it was all like fake.. Poe was obnoxiously careless and Finn and Rose\u2019s little side quest was pointless. It was way too long\\, disappointing\\, and boring. Just plain upsetting.","true":true}
