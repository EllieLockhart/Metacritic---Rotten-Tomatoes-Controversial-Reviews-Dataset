Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not s Star Wars movie. This is something else\\, and the fact that it contains characters from the SW lore really makes it really weird. The sentence \\\"kill the past to become what you have to be\\\" is\\, unfortunately\\, extremely metaphorical: it seems like Disney wanted to kill Star Wars. I believe they succeeded.\\n\\nThe very first scenes of Poe and (sigh) Luke set the tone of the film. When things start to become interesting\\, and you manage to build some tension or epic moments\\, just throw a silly joke in between - we wouldn't let it become far too serious\\, you know. Really\\, sometimes the movie looks like a parody\\, a comedy sketch that you could see in a late night show. And while in the previous movies irony was used just by certain characters and in certain situations\\, here every character has a Benny Hill Show moment. I cannot forgive the way in which this movie ridiculizes the original Skywalker lightsaber. I cannot forgive that \\\"towel\\\" joke. Why? Why they had to do that\\, many times thoughout the movie? And that's not all...\\n\\nThe plot is sluggish and some characters were really badly\\, badly used\\, with entire useless subplots taking the screentime that maybe other moments deserved. Even if the actors do their best\\, dialogues are generally terrible. One can see how Daisy Ridley struggle in trying to make interesting some of her lines.\\n\\nBig disappointment. Hugely wasted potential. An entire epic lore sacrified to the will of the market. Star Wars is dead. And what's worse is thinking that the spark\\, the good\\, seminal ideas\\, were all there\\, ready to be developed instead of being destroyed.\\n\\nAnd the \\\"flying-in-space\\\" scene. Oh god\\, how I wish they killed the character there. A big NO\\, really.","true":true}
