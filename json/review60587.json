I started this game with very high expectations after the first being my favourite game ever. There are so many twists and turns throughout and it takes you on a journey far from what was expected. If you play part 2 with a hint of attachment to the first then I\u2019m afraid you may not enjoy it as much as I have. It requires a little open-mindness and to kind of forget the first game for a sec\\, I\u2019ll admit i struggled to do this and about halfway through it was very hard to play. But I stuck at it and I\u2019m glad I did. You are forced to see things differently and who or what you thought was the evil in the game really isn\u2019t. A true masterpiece. Well done NaughtyDog!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
