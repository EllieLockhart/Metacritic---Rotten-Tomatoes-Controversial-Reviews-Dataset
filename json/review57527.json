Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a pretty average action adventure sci-fi film. The Last Jedi makes a huge jump in tone and story-telling for every other Star Wars film which left me feeling very baffled. Most of the dialogue and humor seemed more appropriate for a film like Guardians of the Galaxy than Star Wars. The movie is 152 minutes long\\, yet most of the sub-plots lead nowhere and ultimate contribute very little to the outcome in proportion to the amount of screen time they occupied. While I thought the action and visuals were pretty entertaining in the 3rd act\\, but this movie is just boring for large chunks. People in my matinee screening fell asleep. This movie is worth a watch\\, but I will not be shelling out money for a cinema ticket. I'll wait for home video. All-in-all it was a pretty big disappointment.","true":true}
