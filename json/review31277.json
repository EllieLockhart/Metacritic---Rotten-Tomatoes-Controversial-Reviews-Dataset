Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So master Jedi Luke got drunk one night and decided to kill Kylo instead of protecting his nephew and take out a sith lord? What happened to the knights of Ren? This is not a triology\\, it is a mash passed from one director to another without any flow or tone. The skywalker story has been officially destroyed. I am done with Disney star wars.","true":true}
