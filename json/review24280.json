Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mess of a plot\\, ruins the futures of your favorite oldies\\, and every character is either boring\\, underused\\, or overpowered. None of the characters learn anything or change in any way. An hour of this movie could be removed and it wouldnt affect the nearly nonexistent plot that makes no sense. Save yourself and go watch the originals again","true":true}
