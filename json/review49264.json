Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star wars movie of all time hot garbage... Poor plot no back story on major characters.... princess leia Poppins was one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in a star wars movie..... The fight scenes were pooo .....","true":true}
