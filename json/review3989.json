Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring plot of a long slow space race.  Character development is predictable until a certain moment when they suddenly become something else for no reason other than a plot twist.  The ending leaves no reason to see a final chapter.  Of all Star Wars movies I will not buy this one.  Never interested in seeing again.  I would rather they tie this one off and end the franchise than continue this slow decline into failure.","true":true}
