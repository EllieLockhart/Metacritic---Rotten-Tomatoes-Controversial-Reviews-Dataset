Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie\\, there is no progression from the previous one. It also demonstrates a lack of understanding around general character development and storytelling. Normally love starwars films but this was atrocious. Would recommend anyone who is reading this to not waste your time watching this film.","true":true}
