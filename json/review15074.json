Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater disappointed. The writer had so many opportunities to give Star Wars fans what they wanted and he failed to do so. The questions the fans wanted answers to were either dull or unanswered. I kept waiting for a moment that would leave my jaw on the floor. It never happened. This movie was written in the absolute worst possible way. I would leave zero stars if I could. I've been so excited to see this movie for two years only to be let down in the worst way.","true":true}
