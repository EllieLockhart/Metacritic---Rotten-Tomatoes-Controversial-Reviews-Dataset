Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m all for subverting expectations. Game of Thrones did it all the time. The difference is\\, their subversions usually made sense. This film is filled with spite and resistance of the wrong kind. The toxic fans are one thing\\, but there are legitimate issues with how Luke and our new trio of heroes expand their stories in this film. Especially the utter lack of respect for Luke and who he\u2019s grown to be. I think Rian is a fine director\\, but thumbing the eyes of fans who have followed a story for 40+ years shows very little admiration or respect for the material you\u2019ve been given the honor to be a part of.
