Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think back\\, the more things I find that I don't like about this movie. But at the same time\\, the more I realise these flaws ar just a small part of such a vast\\, grand\\, emotionally resonant movie. Some questionable narrative choices really annoy me\\, but it's strong themes of learning from failure\\, solid acting\\, incredible action rousing score and breathtaking visuals make for a wildly entertaining time and a wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
