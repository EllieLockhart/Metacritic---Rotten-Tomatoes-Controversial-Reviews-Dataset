Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was great. Farr better than VII. Hard to wright without spoilers but killed the 2 stupid discussions going on externally. Who is snoke\\, who are Reys parents. Stupid inconsequential  questions that are now resolved done and dusted. A few continuity problems and not enough detail on some sub plots. This movie could have easily been another 30min to sort the problems. If I view this movie through my imaginary 12 year old eyes (it's made for 12 year olds remember) it's great. Some of the humor falls short but most brings a laugh from the audience. Overall I had fun and enjoyed the movie as someone who saw the original Star Wars as a 12 year old I approve of this movie and will go and see it again.","true":true}
