Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good fun to watch as a standalone action movie however lack of depth to the chracter`s plot. Too much side story and other sub character plot which is unnecessary. \\n\\nshould have just stick to how George tells it in the OT. Keep it simple but in depth.\\n\\nhow could one become a Jedi within few days of training? Look how luke grows from EP4 to EP6 then you will understand how fans follow the character","true":true}
