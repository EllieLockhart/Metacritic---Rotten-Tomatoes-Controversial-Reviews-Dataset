Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wtf? Worst edited movie in the franchise. Rian Johnson must leave. This could have been so much better.Why all the social justice nonsense in a sc- fi war epic\\, in a galaxy far far away?               Were there actually a plot? Holdo did nothing\\, Rey brought a ghost and something on the side I guess.\\,                   .","true":true}
