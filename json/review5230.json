Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent movie that is borderline good\\, could say a few steps in the right direction\\, but a lot of flaws and 45 minutes that lull you to sleep with side stories that matter little. Throw in a lot of character moments missed for various reasons and you have a slight disappointment. Seriously\\, does Kylo Ren have to be so emo?","true":true}
