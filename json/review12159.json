Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a long time fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy and love them with all my heart this movie disappointed me in every way that a Star Wars movie shouldn't it goes out of its way to establish its new story in a truly unbelievable way. It was visually impressive and daring made. I truly see Star Wars in a different light and fortunately not a positive one. May the force linger with you!","true":true}
