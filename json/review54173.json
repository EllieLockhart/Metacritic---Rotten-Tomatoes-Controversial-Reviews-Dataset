Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I find it hilarious that some people actually can tout this as a good star wars movie. I could only give it a good rating if it was either a star wars spoof or was a general scifi movie unrelated to star wars\\, and even then the science flaws would give me an issue. Please note that the following paragraphs will contain some plot information.(Spoilers)\\n\\nScience Issues: So apparently in the star wars universe\\, there is no decompression when opening a ship's cargo hold to vacuum\\, inertial dampeners do nothing to reduce sudden motion\\, and a small woman can kick the frame of a ship hard enough to shake loose an item on an upper deck. Also\\, since when was the force usable as a space suit??? especially to one who is untrained in the force. Also\\, while i can see using a ship approaching super luminal speeds being used as a battering ram\\, since when did that slice apart over half a dozen ships outside the flight path of the ramming ship? \\n\\nScience based plot holes aside\\, we have a mary sue who apparently can defeat the strongest of the Jedi with only one day of training and who is convinced she can turn the bad guy\\, who was evil and committed multiple murders as a child. Apparently she forgets that any padawan that he couldnt take to Snoke he murdered and burnt in the temple. They then waste the bad guy completely without manifesting him to his full potential as a villain. And to top it off\\, we have Phasma\\, this uber storm trooper\\, who could have been the new Boba Fett chasing the rebellion to hell and back\\, wasted in a fight resulting from a pointless mission to give the diversity hire character a chance to give their backstory\\, be betrayed by a man\\, and to marginalize the black storm trooper that joined the rebellion in The Force Awakens. She not only marginalized him in the mission\\, but in transit and on the planet for the final battle\\, stopping his heroic effort to stop the first order and a weapon whose full potential he knew. And finally\\, in like her fifth time in her life using the force\\, Rey lifts a freaking landslide of boulders\\, which by their multitude and weight seemed like a job Luke or Yoda would have found difficult.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, even though the rebellion failed\\, we are supposed to be happy that it survived\\, even though 95% of the people that died could have been saved in a much shorter time if they had offloaded everyone onto the support ships\\, transfering fuel at that time as well\\, and then rammed snoke's ship with the flagship or if the had loaded everyone on the flagship earlier\\, they could have turned the support ships around and done 2 light-speed rams and then jumped away. No need for filler plots and honestly a better movie.","true":true}
