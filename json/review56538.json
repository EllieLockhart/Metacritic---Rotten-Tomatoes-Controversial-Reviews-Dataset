Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi doesn't have any impression in several ways but at least John Williams' score still finds the lost mojo. He seemed to rehash the old themes from the previous score such as Leia's theme and Force theme. It brings out a quite emotional nostalgia effect in it. Apart from the script and the mess-up plot\\, the actors and the actresses gave their best performance. I still love Mark Hamill until now because he still has his passion. Carrie Fisher is pretty good at this movie\\, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are such a phenomenal performance. Don't forget the Porgs even though it cames as a fan service but this is the cutest thing I've ever seen. In the end\\, I could be able to appreciate a \\\"short\\\" of this movie in terms of its technical importance despite coming out of a sense of disappointment and frustration. The Last Jedi does offer something new but we only didn't take the new things. It's the same as The Empire Strikes Back or the whole prequel series which we first hated or liked it to be the opposite.","true":true}
