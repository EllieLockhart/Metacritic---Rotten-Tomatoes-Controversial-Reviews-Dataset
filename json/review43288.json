Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a fantastic movie that felt like a real evolution for the franchise.\\n\\nNo longer does it feel like it is standing in the shadow of the original trilogy\\, but now stands alone as a great movie for itself.\\n\\nThe pacing was phenomenal\\, the references weren't belabored to the point of rolling my eyes\\, and I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend!","true":true}
