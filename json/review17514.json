Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I shall try to be circumspect when it comes to plot points of The Last Jedi. This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It used exceptional cinematographic techniques\\, the right amount of CGI\\, an excellent score and it possessed good pacing and chronology. It also hit enough of the fantastical elements inherent in Star Wars movies that it did feel like it belonged in the Star Wars franchise. However\\, that was merely on a superficial level. That Star Wars feel all but disappears when you consider the elements of the storylines that are present in the movie. One arc\\, could have easily been avoided with the inclusion of one line of dialogue\\, and\\, that storyline\\, was rendered completely redundant by the fact that Finn and Rose trusted quite possibly the least trustworthy Star Wars character since Hondo Ohnaka in the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series\\, who actually tells them that nobody on the planet that they found him should be trusted. Then\\, there's the inclusion of a one-off female character that is placed in charge when Leia is incapacitated\\, because reasons. She then spends just about every scene she is in talking down to Po\\, and quoting Leia\\, turning it from an arc focusing on her\\, or Po\\, to just another part of Leia's arc. Another down point about this character is that she's got short hair that has been dyed purple\\, something that has deep\\, real-life\\, social connotations that cannot be ignored. Then there is the fact that multiple storylines crafted in the previous movie (The Force Awakens) are killed off\\, leaving JJ Abrams one seriously tough job to save the series in one film without it needing to be as long as to original movie in the The Lord Of the Rings trilogy. This problem was even noted by Gwendoline Christie and brought up with the directior(Rian Johnson) as they were filming when she mentioned that it felt like they were shooting a stand-alone movie.\\n\\nThe problem that led to the travesty that this movie became is inextricably linked to every storyline in The Last Jedi; Rian Johnson's 'bold new direction'. The problem with the new direction is a very base and simple one. It isn't 'new' or 'bold' at all. All three storylines present in The Last Jedi\\, were about a female 'humanising' whichever male character they were with at the time. This is not a common thread in modern story telling because it dropped away as the various civil rights movements won whichever 'war' they were fighting at the time. However it is present in earlier works\\, especially by female authors\\, such as Charlotte Bronte in Jane Eyre(1847) and Daphne Du Maurier in Rebecca(1938). It is bad enough in both books\\, however it isn't as toxic to the medium in either of their works\\, because of the timespan that the story takes to complete. In The Last Jedi\\, it picks up where it left off in The Force Awakens and then takes around two to three days to complete\\, ending up with Rey being established as the quintessential Mary Sue\\, stronger in the force than Luke was at the end of The Return of the Jedi and able to fly just about any ship that she wants\\, and repair them\\, upon first sight...oh\\, and understand Chewie & R2-D2.","true":true}
