Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst of the Star Wars series. The Force Awakens sets the stage beautifully for this movie and this movie completely destroys everything that was built. Not really sure what they were thinking. All for taking chances but little made sense. The franchise built a lot of strong characters and this movie just wanted to break them down.","true":true}
