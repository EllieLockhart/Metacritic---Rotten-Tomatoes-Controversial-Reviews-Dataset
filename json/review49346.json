Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie yet. Disney has ruined his franchise by trying to take a name and make it politically correct in order to rake in more money. Wish George Lucas could get his rights back and correct this travesty.","true":true}
