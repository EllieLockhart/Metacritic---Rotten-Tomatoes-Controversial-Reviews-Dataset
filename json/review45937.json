Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually and musically\\, this film is fantastic! That's where the good ends. The plotlines are awful\\, especially the one concerning Finn and Rose. A middle film in a trilogy should have a good cliffhanger\\, but there is none here. Please tell me\\, what is there to look forward to in the next movie? Severe lack of character  development is also present in this....and Rian Johnson is going to direct another Star Wars trilogy? No thanks!","true":true}
