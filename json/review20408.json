Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand what it was trying to say\\, but failed to deliver that message. Messy\\, unfinished storylines beyond Rey and Kylo\\, who were the highpoints. Didn't love the assassination of Luke's character. Honestly\\, it read more like Rian Johnson's Star Wars fanfic\\, than it did a Star Wars movie. Well made\\, just not my favorite direction for the story.","true":true}
