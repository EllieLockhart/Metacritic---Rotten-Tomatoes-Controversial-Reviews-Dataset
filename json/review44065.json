Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a terrible movie in my opinion. The actions that Luke took in this movie seemed completely out of charachter for him. Luke saw the good in everyone\\, even his father. Yet\\, he couldn't see the good in his nephew? its dumb. Most of the characters are unlikable or have incredibly preachy dialog. I could go on and on\\, but in conclusion I really dont like this movie. ","true":true}
