Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the space battles and nearly loved that last fight\\, but no such luck.  I am a huge fan of star wars\\, especially the original novels and the prequels were alright.  They have deliberately ripped pieces of the novels story out to create a worse story with blatant reverse sexism and plot convenience.  No doubt porgs and chewbacca rocked.  Seeing yoda was also a nice touch.  This Luke though was not the luke that should have been put forward.  He learns and evolves\\, but he never abandons his friends in self exhile. I can only recommend renting this if at all and never buying a ticket or buying a copy.","true":true}
