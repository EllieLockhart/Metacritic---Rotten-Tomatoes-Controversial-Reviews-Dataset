Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some exciting and well-shot action sequences. Excellent pacing\\, and deft coordination of multiple story lines. Comic relief was certainly funny\\, but was relief from...what exactly? The story felt morally and emotionally shallow. Character deaths didn't have much weight. The failings of the Jedi were insufficiently explored; only teased at. And no one exhibited much growth or evolution. Nor did we seem to learn anything: nothing about the Jedi religion\\, nothing about Rey\\, nothing about Snoke\\, and really nothing about Kylo's rebellion (save for fragments of conflicting perspectives). After two years of build up and hype\\, the creators casually discarded the viewers' two most hotly debated questions.  No spoilers here\\, but the treatment of these two issues not only ruins this film for me\\, but makes me enjoy The Force Awakens less. Could not be more disappointed.","true":true}
