Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't mind switching the whole 10 min of Luke being Bear Grylls for 1 min shot of just Snoke telling us about how he came to power","true":true}
