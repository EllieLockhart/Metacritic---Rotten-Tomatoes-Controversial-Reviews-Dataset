Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The characters are poorly handled\\, the casino subplot and everyone involved was a waste of time\\, any tantalizing mystery from TFA is killed off for no apparent reason other than for Rian Johnson to say \u201cWhoa\\, bet you never saw this coming! I\u2019m so edgy and unpredictable!\u201d A lot of bad things can be said about this movie-at least the visuals were gorgeous and the score was beautifully handled by John Williams per usual.","true":true}
