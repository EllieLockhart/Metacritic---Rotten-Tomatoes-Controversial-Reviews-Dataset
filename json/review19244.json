Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not a hated movie because it didn't fit with our expectations. It's hated because it's genuinely a bad film. The Luke-Rey stuff is \\\"tolerable\\\" at best. Regardless of what Disney says or does\\, this sequel trilogy is now considered fan-fiction by most\\, not part of the official Star Wars canon. This film ruined the entire new trilogy.","true":true}
