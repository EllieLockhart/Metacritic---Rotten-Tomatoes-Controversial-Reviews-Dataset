Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out of theater kind of numb about the whole movie.  First Star Wars movie that I have felt that way about.  Episode 9 will determine how good The Last Jedi really was. Guess that's how Disney wants it to be","true":true}
