Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Felt like Disney thought that if the title said Star Wars then they could do whatever they wanted with the film. I mean well done on making money for the studio\\, but an overall major stain on a cherished franchise. Knowing that there has to be an episode IX is exciting\\, but now also terrifying.","true":true}
