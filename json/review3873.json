Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bloody fantastic and emotional. I left the theatre not knowing how to feel... did i like it\\, love it? I did... emotion was getting the better of me seeing Carrie fisher and wondering what the next movie will bring","true":true}
