Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't like the first one I don't know why I went to see the second one. My first thought was \\\"I've already seen this movie Thor:Ragnorok.\\\" The light hearted tone was incredibly distracting and took away from any deaths or serious moments.","true":true}
