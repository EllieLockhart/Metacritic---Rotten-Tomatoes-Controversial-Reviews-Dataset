Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi disappointed much to me...They killed the Legacy\\, Soul and Spirit of the Star Wars..it sucked..worthless for me\\nI think RT was not objective...can't they see the plot holes and many disconnection with TFA?\\nI revise my rate to be one star\\, because i heard 1\/2 star is not counted...","true":true}
