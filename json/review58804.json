I think this is why some people hated it so badly\\, because this game made them FEEL strongly\\, and they couldn't work through their feelings (yet).\rThe reason I feel the opposite\\, strongly positive way about it\\, is because of the success of being able to work through it\\, and gain a deeper understanding not just about the characters\\, but about myself (and others around me) too.

It is dark\\, brutal\\, and so very lifelike and brave. I'm holding it an etalon of storytelling in (this genre of) videogames.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
