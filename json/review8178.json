Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie. I think it\u2019s the cool thing to do to hate on this movie right now\\, hence all the low ratings. I\u2019ve seen it twice\\, it\u2019s even more amazing the second time around as there is SO much to digest the first go through. Really good. People who hate the humor? Original franchise had humor too. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t childish then\\, so why is it now? Just because you\u2019re a bit older doesn\u2019t mean other generations can\u2019t be given something to enjoy too. Something for everyone in this movie\\, A+","true":true}
