Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why people hate this movie so much... I'm a huge Star Wars fan.. been one since I was able to walk.. in 18 now.. and I can easily say this is the best Star Wars to come out in my lifetime. The further character development of Rey and Kylo Ren are absolutely brilliant. Two confused\\, misguided\\, (or in Rey's case\\, at first\\, not guided at all)\\, angry\\, hungry\\, anxious\\, young people with a power they will never be able to fully understand. The obvious energy shared between them and their ability to speak to and feel each other with their respective force is a great extension of the ancient Jedi power. Kylo Ren just being so angry and power hungry\\, but still vulnerable and weak\\, juxtaposed with Rey's passion to harvest Kylo Ren's true potential and true good is compelling. Bitter\\, old\\, cynical\\, isolated Luke was done brilliantly as well. People don't like this film because Rian Johnson f*cked with Star Wars. He made one of Star Wars' great heroes reject the force\\, and give up on the greater good. This film showed luke as a flawed\\, shell of a man who can no longer find the motivation to keep trying to save the world that is destined for doom anyway. Although\\, he eventually figures out that in order for the legend to keep moving forward\\, it needs to die. Which is kind of the main point of the movie\\, teat down what once was\\, and build something new from the rubble. I could go on forever\\, and there is no way anybody is reading this anyway\\, so I'll stop here. I loved this movie. My jaw was dropped 45% of the time. I almost came during several scenes.","true":true}
