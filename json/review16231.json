Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not a bot or a hacker\\, or anything else that outlets are trying to say why this movie has such a low audience rating.\\n\\nI'm a real person.\\n\\nAnd As a die hard who camped out for 3 weeks time in front of the big Newport theater to see episode I in 1999\\, I thought the last Jedi was the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen and a pristine example of $ & profit influencing a cinematic lore & universe that stands against those very concepts\\n\\nIn my opinion\\, it's not only the worst Star Wars movie\\, but just an awful piece of film making\\, with no direction & so many hack jokes intended for a pop culture target audience of those who prefer a cheap laugh rather than a good story.\\n\\nAgain\\, this is just my opinion as a long time fan with Star Wars tatoos and an un-Dying love for the original saga\\, pre - 7 & 8\\n\\nI was SO excited for it & wanted to like it\\, but walked out depressed & severely disappointed.","true":true}
