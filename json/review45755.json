Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very good visuals. Joyless and shallow the designed by committee script basically disassembles the mythology of the first three classsics and replaces it with every social justice squawking point Disney could cram in.  That being said it's okay entertainment and I'm sure kids and critics will enjoy this mess.","true":true}
