Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am amazed after seeing all the positives from the professional film critics. Did they get a different movie to watch that was actually good? Is Disney paying these guys off? \\nAbout 30 minutes into this snoozefest I couldn't wait for it to end. Unfortunately\\, there was still 2 hours to endure. Kylo Ren and Rey are likeable and the story to them was somewhat interesting\\, but the majority of the movie made no sense.\\nLuke Skywalker constantly dissed the Jedi's. Snoke who was supposedly a very tough guy was killed very easily. We find out who Rey's parents were in am incredibly MEH story. I could go on and on. \\nMuch of the film felt like filler AND what was that Princess Leah space thing all about. Jedi's can breath in outer space! Who knew? \\nSo\\, don't bother and what the heck were all of you professional critics thinking. How much did Disney pay you?","true":true}
