Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hmm\\, saw it this afternoon\\, and when leaving the cinema felt more than a little confused\\, being as after TFA my feeling was \\\"I want more\\\". But the more I think about it\\, the more I think it was quite good. Not wow amazing. Just quite good overall.\\n\\nThe Luke-Rey-Kylo Ren thing worked well for me. Snoke not seeing that coming seems quite funny on reflection. There did seem a little too much humour in the movie\\, but why take it too seriously? I liked the porgs too (I was dreading them - no more Jar Jars please).\\n\\nThe scenes about the ships running out of fuel creaked quite badly\\, and I sat through them wishing for more of the grumpy\\, depressed Luke Skywalker. \\n\\nThe casino subplot was completely pointless other than featuring some cuddly toy horse things and getting two characters into a ludicrous \\\"falling in love\\\" situation (is this star trek or star wars?)\\n\\nExpectations satisfied? No... but expectations adjusted? Yes.\\n\\nIt's one of those movies to think about after you've seen it. What's wrong with that?","true":true}
