Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked the fight scene in the throne room and that's about it. It makes everyone in the movie completely incompetent\\, bad dialogue and writing in general\\, makes the first two movies in the franchise irrelevant and completely changes fundamental laws of the star wars universe in a way that nothing makes sense now.
