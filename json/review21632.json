Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Judging from the commercial flop of SOLO\\, I'm guessing people didn't like Last Jedi.  I certainly didn't. Its the film that killed Star Wars. But perhaps thats what Rian Johnson wanted? After all the theme of Last Jedi is \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.\\\" Well Rian\\, if killing 40 years of love for Star Wars was your intention\\, congratulations! You succeeded.","true":true}
