Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it could have been better. Would have liked to see more of back story Rey and also snoke\\, and did Luke really try and kill his nephew? Come on this represent light side of the force. But overall I loved it.","true":true}
