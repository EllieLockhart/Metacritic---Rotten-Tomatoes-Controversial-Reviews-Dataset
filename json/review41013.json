{"101487":183818,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nAs a film it is character-driven\\, thought-provoking and well directed. As a Star Wars film - it is fresh and not a re-tread (to say this 8 films into a series is quite an achievement).\\n\\nI don't understand the backlash against it - people who say they went in expecting answers about who Snoke was\\, and who Rey's parents are\\, as a result of The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens did not \\\"introduce\\\" Snoke as a mystery character who's origin was the subject of any debate\/mystery - he was simply \\\" here\\\"\\, clearly as someone who was Kylo\/Ben's master\\, 30 years on from Return of the Jedi. Clearly\\, he knew (or knew of) Darth Vader\\, and rose up after the Emperor - but I did not leave The Force Awakens thinking - Gee\\, this movie set up a mystery of where did Snoke come from and how exactly did he end up in such a position of power. Why do we have the need to be told everything about a character and not have some things unanswered. He was powerful and in control of The First Order and Kylo\/Ben - but the movie was not about Snoke\\, it was about Kylo\/Ben.\\n\\nI can't recall The Force Awakens anywhere teasing us about a revelation regarding Snoke\\, and as for Rey - yes\\, in that film she is \\\"searching\\\" for where she came from - but the emphasis was on the search being her inner journey - not a mystery set up in the film where we as viewers are putting pieces together about her parents.\\n\\nAgain\\, some fans after The Force Awakens (so used to the way past films played out) expected a reveal that had her related to someone - but that is not what The Force Awakens was about. The emphasis was on Rey's character and what it meant for her to not know who she was or where she came from. So when The Last Jedi came out - the reveal about Rey and the death of Snoke furthered the character development of both Rey and Kylo\/Ben. They didn't undermine the plot of The Force Awakens\\, nor did they throw out any mystery \\\"set up\\\" by that film. Fans assumed (wrongly) that there was a mystery. The fact that Rey was told by Maz that the lightsaber calls to her and that she had visions when holding it at first does not mean she was connected by bloodline to Luke\/Ben (Kenobi) etc. She was clearly Force-strong. That was the extent of her connection. And it made her afraid.\\n\\nLuke was reckless (in ANH and ESB) - called out by Yoda always looking to the future and never on where he was and what he was doing. Training for him was needed - but some people are naturally gifted and Rey clearly has the gift while also having the gutso to take on Luke and Kylo\/Ben.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a film that has many layers - and has emotional depth. The first death of Paige\\, and the death of Holdo\\, are both of characters we (at least on film) had never met before - but they were affecting and sent chills down my spine. (I don't think Akbar's death either was summarily dismissed - he was mentioned explicitly in a very affecting scene\\, and that was enough for a character who was not major by any means\\, as much as fans may have endeared themselves to him).\\n\\nMany moments of silence captured so much emotion too - such as when Leia and Kylo were connecting\\, and we waited to see if he would pull the trigger but didn't. These characters are not one-dimensional.\\n\\nI have seen the film 3 times - the first time\\, I was a little unsure of how I felt - simply because the film did not go plotwise where I thought it would. But the second and third viewings have cemented the film as the best of all SW movies - even the casino scene was a diversion that added some texture to the film as a whole\\, and it did not drag by any means\\, and (for me at least) it did have purpose for the theme of the film and also showed (along with much of the film) that even with the best intentions\\, you will not always succeed (no matter what side you are on).\\n\\nThis movie has a depth and rawness that has not been captured in a SW film before.\\n\\nLuke was also not \\\"ruined\\\" as some claim - this is not the Luke we last saw in Return of the Jedi\\, but at the same time\\, this is 30 years later\\, with so much that has happened to him since. It is one thing to redeem your fallen father\\, but to take on the responsibility to train your nephew\\, trusted by your sister and friend\\, and then to think about killing him after seeing the dark side in him - (understandable given all that Luke had seen the dark side do since the first film in 1977) - that would lead any person to feel shame and guilt and to question everything. I don't understand what people wanted to see - Luke being this all-in-control Jedi master. His Last Jedi characterisation adds depth to his character and renders him more human.\\n\\nComplaints have also centred around Phasma - she was not set up to be anything more than a foil for Finn. She added texture to the plot. Some fans seem upset that she died and did not have a greater role to play. She was by no means set up as a main character and anything more than a character to lend colour to a film and round it out. Not every side-character no matter how cool needs to live on and be involved in the main plot.\\n\\nI saw The Last Jedi for the first time with my 12yo son and 10yo daughter (all of us have seen all SW films). We all enjoyed it. I reserved judgment until my 2nd viewing - and on my second viewing (with my 12yo son and his 13yo friend and another adult SW fan\/friend) we all absolutely and thoroughly enjoyed it\\, and I found it very enriching now that I could watch it knowing it was not going to pander to my expectations (regarding plot\\, not regarding how characters should or shouldn't behave).\\n\\nMy third viewing (with my wife who loves a good film but is not a SW fan (though she has casually seen them all thanks to me!) - and I absolutely was enthralled and moved by the film again\\, and my wife (who'd not seen The Force Awakens since 2015) was also glued to her seat and thoroughly enjoyed the film - as a great film (irrespective of it being a Star Wars film).\\n\\nNo \\\"I am your father\\\" revelation - but it's a film that as a result will stand up to multiple viewings and dissection of meaning. It is character driven and well-acted\\, leading up to a finale that is truly emotional.","true":true}
