Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie opened up as if it was going to be the best starwars ever filmed. It was so anticipated that when it was over I really felt confused.\\n\\nThe high wore off once the action stopped. it was so mellow everyone in the theater could hear me eat popcorn and open my fruit snacks.\\n\\nI felt like I was watching a bunch of pathetic outcasts struggle to survive let alone rebel against anyone. This movie was about watching the worst two days in the galaxies existence. I would of rather watch maz barfight instead of the rebels trying to escape and then die.\\n\\nI don't know why but this isn't the same starwars I spent most my life dreaming about. This was a shit movie filled with meaningless dialog.","true":true}
