Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Divorcing it from the Star Wars property\\, I feel it was a solidly mediocre movie at best. The pacing is a bit of a slog\\, and it's padded out with filler subplots that go nowhere. Also\\, it reflects a trend I'm seeing in these blockbuster action\/fantasy\/sci-fi\/superhero movies lately\\, that EVERYONE has to have witty one-liners ALL THE TIME\\, frequently spoiling the tone of key scenes and distracting from the plot. That cancer ravaged the horror genre\\, and is metastasizing to other genres now.\\n\\nAs a Star Wars movie\\, it's fairly sub-par. After the screening\\, my buddy Devin and I ranked all of the live-action films (including Rogue One and\\, for shiggles\\, The Holiday Special to make a nice\\, round 10 places)\\, and The Last Jedi placed in the lower half on my list\\, just above Phantom Menace\\, Attack of the Clones\\, and The Holiday Special (which\\, as much as it pains me to say\\, felt more like a Star Wars movie than TLJ). It has some shining moments of awesomeness that make it worth seeing\\, but those gems are buried deep in the dumpster fire. It's one of those movies where the more I think about it\\, the more my opinion on it sours.\\n\\nIn the end\\, see it for yourselves and form your own opinions\\, but if my opinion is worth a damn to you\\, I can't see adding it to my bookshelf anytime soon.","true":true}
