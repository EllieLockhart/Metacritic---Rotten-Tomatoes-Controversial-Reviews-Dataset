Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd like to give it zero stars.  Terrible writing\\, terrible handling of Luke skywalker.  it was visually stunning.  no setup as to why Holdo would tell Poe her plan.  everything setup in 7 was thrown away.   it would have been clever to throw a fwe things away\\, but to literally throw them all away was terrible.  watching the \\\"writing\\\" for luke was painful.   like the worst version of \\\"don't meet your heros\\\" you could imagine.  I love Finn but didn't like his story at all.   I think he should have shipped with Poe\\, but instead the cram in a last minute ship with the new mechanic character.   i didn't like her character arc either.   she lost her sister in a battle\\, and then at one point it seems like all she cares about is freeing animals.   uhm ? really?  wouldn't you be more focused on avenging your sister?  making sure her sacrifice lead to a victory?  but nope  she forgets all that for a bit and just wants to promote peta.   Phasma was wasted again.   admiral ackbar was wasted mis-treated .    i did like the snoke subversion plot twist and that fight scene.   movie was visually amazing\\,  but the story was god aweful and it even manages to take away from the OT.    just sad.   Its star wars so i'll say you should see it. but damn.  you should probably get drunk first and expect the worst.   worse than episode 2.   this is the worst star was out of all 9 of them.","true":true}
