Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The second best chapter in the Star Wars Saga! This film keep conventional staples of the saga while infusing fresh and surprising twists along the way Hamill\\, Ridley\\, Driver\\, Fisher\\, and the porgs all shine as the standouts in this chapter while a shocking cameo proves that there is still room for everyone's favorite characters to reappear.","true":true}
