Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a lot of fun.  And it was also just a movie.  It is not going to be a cinematic experience that future film makers will look back on and say\\, \\\"the Last Jedi was the film that made me want to go into the film industry\\\"  This phrase could have been said about the original trilogy but not of the modern take on the STAR WARS SAGA.  However\\, The Last Jedi did bring a smile to my face and surprised me with a few twists. \\nSpoiler time \\nLooking back on it I would have preferred that they had re-introduced Lando's character by having him be the code breaker that they went to look for on Canto Bight.  That would have made this whole scene feel like it was actually needed rather than just being something to keep Finn busy during the film.  Also\\, the whole running out of fuel thing seemed a little off.  It would have been more fun if the fleet kept having to hyper jump to multiple systems in search of allies against the First Order\\, only to me met by the First Order fleet after a few minutes.  This would have allowed for more action sequences and it would have helped to explain where the rest of the galaxy stands on the war between the First Order and the Resistance.\\nSo\\, not a perfect movie but it was very good.","true":true}
