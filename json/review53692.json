Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the very first scene it was obvious this movie was going to be trash. Thanks for ruining Star Wars Disney\/ Rian Johnson. If you want a full detailed list of what went wrong with the film\\, let me know and I will take a day off from work to write that list.","true":true}
