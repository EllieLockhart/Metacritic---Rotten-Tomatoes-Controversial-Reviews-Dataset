Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"inconsistent characterisation\\, pointless plot\\,c coupled with PLOT-HOLES you could fly a star destroyer through\\, WILFUL rejection of canon and DISRESPECTFUL treatment of established characters\\, unfortunately the franchise is careening to an IGNOMINIOUS end","true":true}
