Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney manages to pull the incredible and make STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI even worse that its predecessor\\, THE FORCE AWAKENS. Because\\, wow\\, it was bad. Copying THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\\, a movie that we are all familiar with\\, fans will notice an outrageous ressemblance to a much-beloved film. Example: imagine Crait is Hoth\\, and that Anch-To is Dagobah. See?\\nTHE LAST JEDI also seems to swap out a lot of action for a lot of chit-chat scenes\\, and I really had a hard time trying to enjoy this movie. I'm a huge STAR WARS fan\\, but\\, I'm sorry\\, this movie does not do the franchise justice. I did not enjoy this movie.","true":true}
