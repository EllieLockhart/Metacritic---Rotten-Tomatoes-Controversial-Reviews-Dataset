Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a really good film on it's own but a terrible Star Wars film and that's what really matters to the fans. The story was badly written and failed to address really important points which are linked to Star Wars lore. I don't think Rian Johnson is a true fan and it shows in his mishandling of this film. Help us JJ Abrams\\, you're our only hope.","true":true}
