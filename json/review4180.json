Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By all means\\, this is probably the most controversial and unexpected Star Wars as others have been saying. Concerning the plot\\, it deviates heavily from the rehashed structure of the Force Awakens and tears down many of the preconceptions that viewers may have of the franchise\\, leaving it fairly provocative in nature. The humanist elements in the characters and sublime moral complexity in the representation of the dark and light side\\, however\\, are the strong points of this movie as they challenge the viewer to reconsider the series mythology. My biggest criticism is the pacing of the movie\\, as some of the character arcs are a lot weaker than others\\, and somewhat annoying to be dragged through when there are more interesting things going on. Overall I think it's definitely a film worth viewing (I daresay more than once)\\, not just because it's a Star Wars film but because it has good messages to reflect on.","true":true}
