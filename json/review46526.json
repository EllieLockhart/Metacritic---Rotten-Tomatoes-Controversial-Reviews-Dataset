Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watched it Thursday\\, the day before opening..walked out after the movie shaking my head. I clicked on to google and started typing in The Last Jedi\\, d  and it auto-suggested disappointed\\, which was what I was planning to type. This was on the night before opening night. This movie made me have no desire to see episode 9.","true":true}
