Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens which was great movie got me so excited for the last Jedi\\, specially at the end! Unfortunately It didn't live up to the force awakens! The films is okay but it just feels very messy and I don't like what's they did with Luke.","true":true}
