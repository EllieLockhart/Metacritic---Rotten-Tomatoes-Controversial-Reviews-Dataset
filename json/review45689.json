Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very fun and well paced movie that fits in nicely with the Star Wars Universe. Slightly disappointed with the lack of use of Snoke and the reveal of Rey's parents this felt rushed and not organic at all. The character development of both Rey and Kylo Ren was well done and Luke as a Jedi Master was interesting but not as well developed as it could have been. \\n\\nThere were some excellent moments that excited and surprised but there were a few too many rushed and throw away moments that left me feeling disappointed with the script. \\n\\nAs for humor I found this the most fun Star Wars movie to date and didn't expect to laugh as much as I did.\\n\\nAll in all a good movie and a definite step on from the Force Awakens but still a little away from the OT. For my kids though this had the same impact on them as Empire had on me so for the new generation I think this film is a success.","true":true}
