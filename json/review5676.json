Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"did rian \\\"reylo\\, kylo ren is my spirit animal\\\" johnson even watch the force awakens or what? almost everyone was out of character and the whole plot ultimately amounted to nothing. you could skip this movie and be in the same place you were after force awakens. jj abrams save us in episode 9","true":true}
