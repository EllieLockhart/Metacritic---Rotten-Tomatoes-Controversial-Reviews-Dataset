Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That's Not How the Force Works\\n\\nThe Last Jedi looks stunning.  Beautiful landscapes are intertwined with amazing action shots.  The story jumps between all of the major characters\\, keeping the story moving.  It's just a shame the story is at a standstill the whole time.\\nFrom the first ten minutes of the film\\, everything we know of the force is upended\\, which would be fine if it had been in A Force Awakens.  That film was intended to be a re-boot\\, the next chapter in the Star Wars legacy.  By waiting until The Last Jedi to change everything we know is more of a question mark more than a statement.  \\nOne of the more pressing matters is the negligence of the First Order.  While suspension of disbelief is required to believe in something like the force\\, assuming the audience would buy an army\\, intent on DESTROYING the Restistence\\, not deploying the entire fleet.  It also totally negates Kylo Ren's own personal demonstration in the first sequence that they can get close enough to the ship to wreck havoc.  \\nMany of the so called \\\"plot twists\\\" seem questionable\\, or predictable when placed in line with the movie.  There was a certain scene where storm troopers were all lined up\\, just far enough away and with the line saying\\, \\\"A quick death doesn't suit you.\\\"  We knew there was no true danger for any of the \\\"new\\\" heroes.  With the preceding death of Han Solo\\, many knew the old characters were meeting the end of their ropes.  An announcement from Disney informing us that Carrie Fisher was lined up for Episode IX after her death\\, it did not take much thinking to assume who would end their legacy with The Last Jedi.  \\nMany of the Oscar caliber actors were wasted with confusing characters that were predictable or added nothing to the grand story.  It seemed like one was just a long cameo\\, resulting in death instead of the torch being passed on to a new generation of rebel fighters.  \\n\\nAll in all\\, this is the end of the line for this Star Wars fan.  The items held so dear for the last thirty years have already started to be passed on.  For the first time\\, the newest Star Wars movie will not be added to the family collection.  The books\\, the toys\\, the clothing will be phased out\\, just as the force has abandoned the franchise.  It's breaking my heart\\, but it is a path I will no longer follow.","true":true}
