Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan for 35 years and I was very excited to see this film. I enjoyed Rogue One and The Fire Awakens and thought the story was set up nicely for some wonderful plot lines and character building. I was left so disappointed! I have never rolled my eyes or shaken my head so much in a film. The story was weak\\, the plot had so many holes in it\\, the humour was misplaced and badly timed. It sucked.","true":true}
