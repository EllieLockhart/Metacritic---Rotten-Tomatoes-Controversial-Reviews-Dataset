{"101487":189665,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too noisy!!!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too noisy. And can anybody really explain the logic behind this \\\"movie\\\" in terms of narrative storytelling? Where the heck is the story arch of this trilogy going? Sadly\\, \\\"Star Wars\\\" under Disney has absolutely no direction or clear story arch. \\\"Last Jedi\\\" is convoluted\\, self-egrandizing\\, self-congratulatory\\, all for being nothing more than a series of nonlinear vignettes: some dizzying\\, chaotic space battles that are meant to wow 5-year-olds\\, and some dialogue scenes that are circular and pointless. If it wasnt for Mark Hamill's sense of humor in the whole thing-- and also a couple of little humorous director-throw-ins by Rian Johnson\\, this chapter would be abysmal.... Its only the humor that makes this thing watchable. (which at least puts it above \\\"the Force Awakens\\\"\\, which is completely unwatchable\\, even moreso than \\\"Phantom Menace\\\").... Also\\, to the \\\"Last Jedi's\\\" credit\\, the Porgs arent as bad as i feared-- They are certainly more entertaining the stupid Gungans. But still\\, the chemistry between Oscar Isaac\\, Daisy Ridley\\, and John Boyega just isnt there. None of their characters are likable\\, and we have no reason to care about their actions. None of their characters have really done anything to earn our compassion or enthusiasm. Ever since their introductions\\, all they do is whine and\/or yell from scene to scene... I keep hoping for them to get picked off. And Kylo Ren is horribly written. Adam Driver is at least showing himself to be a great actor who still cant rescue this incredibly lacking story. Funny how the best character development Kylo Ren went through was in the \\\"undercover Boss\\\" sketch on SNL.... And why oh why are the executive powers and producers allowing the original \\\"rebellion vs empire\\\" to just be renamed \\\"resistance vs first order\\\"? Talk about unimaginative drivel! How the hell did all that happen\\, including the rise of Snoke\\, in the last 30 years\\, without anyone noticing? .....Basically\\, \\\"Star Wars\\\" has lost all its integrity-- it has been completely demolished by corporate GREED..... The hope for salvation of any artistic integrity in \\\"Star Wars\\\" is now in the stand-alone films like \\\"Rogue One\\\" (amazing film\\, on par with the original trilogy)....","true":true}
