Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've watched this film twice in this past week. On first viewing\\, it was disjointed and I didn't really like it. I've decided to give it a chance after reading the critics' review and also the 'backlash' by many fans. After watching it the second time\\, it was so much better! I really enjoyed it on repeat viewing when I decided to watch with no expectations at all. Beautiful\\, breathtaking scenes every few mins. A totally awesome experience..","true":true}
