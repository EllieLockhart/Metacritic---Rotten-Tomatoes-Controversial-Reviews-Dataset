Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the 10 minutes snoke was in the film for and the protorian guard fight and luke tricking kylo its kind of worth it and i hope snokes not dead thats like killing palpatine in the second film","true":true}
