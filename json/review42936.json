Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was such a disappointment I nearly walked out of the theater. The directing was atrocious\\, the humor was out of place\\, the poor handling of Star Wars lore\\, the weak storyline and excessive blatant copying of past films plot-points to connect with the audience on a retrospective level made for a truly terrible film. It honestly convinced me to never see one of the thousand more films that are set for release. I see nothing but cash grab here. An that is what Disney is indeed grabbing\\, all the cash. Children and fan-boys will love the film (let's face it\\, these are the same people who enjoyed episode one) and your common movie-goers will probably enjoy too for its special effects... Meh\\, if you like it good for you. you won't have to suffer knowing a film franchise just went down the toilet. Makes me honestly wonder about where the \\\"critics\\\" loyalty lay.","true":true}
