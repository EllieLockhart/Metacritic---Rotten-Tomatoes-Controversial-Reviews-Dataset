Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m honestly a bit surprised to see how much negative kickback that this film has gotten from the fanbase. Was the movie perfect? Absolutely not. There were definitely things that I had problems with\\, but I feel like the positives far outweigh the negatives. This was a really fun film that did a lot of really interesting things with the Star Wars universe\\, even if it was a bit messy at times.","true":true}
