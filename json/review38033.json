Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars story ended with The Return of the Jedi. This new trilogy should have taken place in a different time frame and in another galaxy altogether. It just doesn't fit. This movie doesn't even fit with what J.J. Abrams set up for it. I'll give it credit where it is due; the cinematography\\, special effects\\, and musical score are very well done. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver play their parts very well\\, though I don't care much for their characters in this film. In this film I don't really feel a care for any character in the sense of a hero to look up to\\, or a villain to despise. The writing is nonsensical and story telling is completely absent. There is no sense of adventure. The movie\\, though very long\\, felt very limited and confined. I hope J.J. Abrams can turn this around. This franchise is never going to be the same\\, not even a remnant of its former embodiment. Shame on Rian Johnson and Disney for this disaster of a film.","true":true}
