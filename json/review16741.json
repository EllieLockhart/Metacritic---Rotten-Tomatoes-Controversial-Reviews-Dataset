Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"in late 2018 a Han spin off movie. Just thought you should know. It's still Stars Wars but Disney will ruin it.","true":true}
