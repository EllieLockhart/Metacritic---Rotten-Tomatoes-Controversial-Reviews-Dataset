Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to even start?\\nAside from the movie being visually stunning there really wasn't much to this movie.\\nFinn and Rose's sub-plot was visually enjoyable\\, but seriously slowed the movie and just felt needless in almost every aspect.\\nThey fucked up Snoke BIG TIME\\, dropping all his build-up in the trash can just like Rays origin.\\nChewie was almost totally excluded in the film.\\nLuke was a mess and was only saved by Mark Hamils superb performance.\\nLuke didn't really teach Rey anything\\, she just continued being a Mary Sue\\, being able to do more or less everything as always.\\nPhasma was... pointless? Just a throw-away character once again while she was clearly still meant to be some kind of Finn nemesis.\\nThere was nothing dark about the dark place on the island\\, if anything the place was kinda helpful.\\nLeia played Superman.\\nHoldo was stupid as shit\\, and was the entire cause for the unneeded sub-plot\\, because she didn't want to share info with Poe.\\nThere was an actually pretty obvious political agenda throughout the film\\, where all the bad guys were angry white guys\\, all the main characters were almost women\\, black\\, asian or hispanic\\, and all the evil capitalistic bastards in the sub-plot was rich white people\\, who enjoyed animal cruelty and owned slaves.\\n...but the worst part of it was that for the first time in a Star Wars movie\\, there was not a single actual lightsaber fight throughout the entire movie! There was the equivalent of a bar fight with some henchmen and Luke dodging Kylo's lightsaber. Both scenes was alright and visually stunning\\, but it was so obviously not duels\\, but more the build-up to one\\, which never came.\\n\\nTHe good parts are that they tried to surprise the audience often and I was really surprised with many of the things that happened in the film\\, I would just have liked that it was the positive kind of surprise which i wasn't\\, at least for me.\\n\\nWhat they also did well was a certain hyperspace stunt that was by far my absolute favorite part about the film.\\n\\nYoda was pretty cool\\, though at least to me he looked horrible\\, like they had tried to create the Yoda doll using CGI... plz just fucking pick one or the other! He was pretty cool though and did displayed an amazing force power\\, which was pretty cool and his voice acting and dialogue was very well done as well.","true":true}
