Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an exciting\\, subversive and surprising precursor to the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga\\, combined with Johnson's script and direction\\, the performances of the cast\\, Williams' score\\, Yedlin's cinematography\\, Ducsay's editing\\, Heinrichs' production design\\, Roberts' set decoration\\, Kaplan's costume design\\, action sequences and visual effects\\, The Last Jedi is exciting and mysterious in many ways\\, but it is a Star Wars movie\\, and it surprises you in many ways that you would never expect to be surprised by in this and\/or any other lifetime!","true":true}
