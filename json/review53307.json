Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Continuing the thrilling action\\, raw emotion\\, humor and new mythological twists of the Star Wars resurgence\\, this ambitious episode may make some iffy story decisions\\, but it presents every reason to keep it going.","true":true}
