Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I didn't know any better\\, I would think this movie was written and directed by someone who either hated Star Wars or didn't understand it at all. The few strong moments are so heavily outweighed by frustrating plot holes or lack of respect for the characters\\, that the movie fails on almost every level.","true":true}
