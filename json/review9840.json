Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great addition to the franchise. It has some flaws (find me a movie that doesn't)\\, but it expands on the Star Wars Universe in positive ways that can be sustained long-term. I'm more excited now for Episode 9.","true":true}
