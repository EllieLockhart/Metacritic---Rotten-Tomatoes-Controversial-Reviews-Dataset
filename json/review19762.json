Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an amazing experience from begining to end. From the action packed start all the way through to the emotion filled ending I was absolutely enthralled. It moves away ever so slightly from the tone of the rest of the saga with it's humour\\, but that's whag makes this instalment so charming and beautiful.","true":true}
