You know what else was as long as that? Ya\\, it was FF 15. Guess what? That game had the same issue. One sided characters\\, little to no quality gameplay from the beta that was released\\, and a story that was just downright all over the place because they were too busy trying to sell merchandise. Why people are defending this game is beyond my comprehension\\, and I solemnly regret buying the collectors' edition for this game\\, and will always remember that this game was falsely advertised and will never buy a game with Neil Druckman's name on it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
