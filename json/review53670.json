Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me this was the movie that could have been. I wish I could reach in and remove some things\\, and slightly change others\\, to make it a fantastic film. Plot holes and poor writing let it down for the most part\\, as well as failing to deliver on every plot set up from The Force Awakens. Certain plot and character decisions were baffling to me and an entire half an hour story arc in the film could (and probably should) have been left out\\, as it was rendered entirely pointless as soon as it reached its conclusion. For me\\, there were enough amazing moments that would excite any star wars fan to still make it worth watching\\, and overall\\, despite every logical criticism I have of the film\\, I still inexplicably liked it on balance. But remove the jarring\\, inappropriate humour which didn't mesh with the overall dark tone\\, and make a few plot and character arc alterations and we would have had such a great installment on our hands. For me a bit of a disappointment after how great The Force Awakens was\\, and unless they introduce something radically different\\, I'm already bored for the third installment without having started to watch it. While I kind of liked it\\, I do understand all the fan hatred completely.","true":true}
