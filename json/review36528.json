Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie fails on delivering the answers to the questions asked in Episode 7\\, merely brushing them off the screen. The main plot is dull with pseudo scientific explanations so forced that it becomes painfully illogical. Some of the new characters are great and others not so much. In the end the movie was tailor made for non fans and young viewers\\, new to the franchise. I started with mixed feelings and ended up very disappointed.","true":true}
