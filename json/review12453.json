Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can not believe the complete utter disregard of the original series. I am so sad to see the movie being made by people who could careless about the fans and George Lucas's life work. Disney is dead to me.","true":true}
