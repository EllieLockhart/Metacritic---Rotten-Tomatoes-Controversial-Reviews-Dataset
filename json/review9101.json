Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of superfluous plot lines\\, fake out deaths\\, unimportant characters\\, and garbage plot holes. Characters randomly appear where they shouldn't\\, there are several incredibly cringe worthy scenes\\, and none of the main characters from The Force Awakens interact with each other in any meaningful way - cheapening character motivations and relationships.\\n\\nWhat's especially disappointing is that the first half of the movie sets the stage for a truly great story. Without giving too much away it looks like the trilogy is going in a 'Grey Jedi' (look it up) direction. However this whole idea is abruptly abandoned in favor of a litany of flashy but ultimately unsatisfying action sequences that make absolutely no sense.\\n\\nThe wasted potential is devastating.","true":true}
