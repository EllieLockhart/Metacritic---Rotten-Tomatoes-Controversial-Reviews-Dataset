Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A deep and profound sadness was in me as I left the theater.  Why on earth was the floating Leia even necessary?  The whole Finn story\\, awful casino sequence?  \\nEven the Snoke scene\\, moments of excitement there.  Then\\, when a writer with an original thought could have had Kylo Ren actually go with Rey\\, make the rest of the story about him\\, Rey\\, and Luke bringing the resistance back (throw in some internal issues that need to be dealt with and healed)  But no\\, same old\\, same old.  Waiting to see Luke have his moment but instead was treated to an anti climatic fade away.   Sad\\, just sad.","true":true}
