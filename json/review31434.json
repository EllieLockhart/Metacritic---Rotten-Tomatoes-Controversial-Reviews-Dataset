Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some parts of the movie were the best ever in any star wars film...some issues with the way the characters we used and how the movie changed the star wars universe. Very emotional\\, heart pounding edge of your seat type moments. A few different choices would have went along way with fans.","true":true}
