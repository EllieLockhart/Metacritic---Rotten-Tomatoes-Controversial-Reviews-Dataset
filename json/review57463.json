Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so bad it makes me wonder whether I only liked the original movies because I was a kid.  Time and again\\, new directions in which the story could have gone appeared\\, only to be rejected as the story adhered in the most derivative way possible to the conceits of the earlier movies.  In the trailer\\, with Luke's assertion that the Jedi must end\\, there was a  suggestion that Luke had achieved a greater wisdom or deeper insight that required a new direction.  Nope\\, he was just sulking about things not working out the way he hoped.  There was no real reason for the Jedi to end.  In fact\\, they're not ending.  The title is a lie\\, like pretty much else in this movie.  The few real actors (Driver\\, Fisher\\, del Toro) make everyone else look silly.  Domhall Gleason\\, who was actually good in the last movie\\, chewed the scenery here in the most embarrassing way possible.  This movie is an epic failure of the first order (!).","true":true}
