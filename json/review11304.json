Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honest opinion. It was barely even exciting. It wasn't star wars at all\\, it was just some sifi movie. From a standpoint of story writing\\, it was a complete miss. The purpose of having questions\\, cliff hangers\\, etc are to expand on them. Rian Johnson doesn't understand the very basics of writing a script. I really hope Disney fires him before the 9th. \\nTo be 100% honest\\, I think of this movie as a child who writes his own story. He takes the characters from the star wars universe and completely ruins them so he can make up his own story. It literally tells like fan fiction where the writer wants HIS OWN star wars with subplots. Like alternate universe bullspit where the story has nothing to do with the original canon. \\nI can't express enough my disappointment in this movie. Though they won't\\, because it will make money\\, I just REALLY hope Rian Johnson is fired. Only movie worse was the phantom menace. At least attack of the clones was exciting\\, this boring \\\"slow car chase\\\" movie was just a huge let down.","true":true}
