Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I withheld judgement until my second viewing -focusing on only the good parts - and I think this movie had a lot of potential and squandered most of it. It drags far too much in the middle with side plots that are totally inconsequential and not fun to watch. They should have focused far more on character building seeing as we still need to get to know Rey\\, Finn\\, and Kylo more. The interactions between Rey and Kylo and Rey and Luke are the best part of the movie and should have been focused on more. Instead\\, some odd choices were made that I won\u2019t elaborate on because I don\u2019t want to spoil it. Some of them were brilliant\\, but others were just ridiculous. I left the theater both times feeling the experience was cheap and unfulfilling. At times\\, it didn\u2019t even feel like Star Wars. I can\u2019t help but think this trilogy is tarnished because of it. I can only hope Disney somehow manage to turn this around in the next one\\, but I really felt this was the episode that would make or break the trilogy.","true":true}
