Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had such potential and just went in the wrong direction.  So many talented actors wasted such a rich history thrown away. It's like they set up so much lore and a huge universe  they didn't know where to take it so it was best to just split things.","true":true}
