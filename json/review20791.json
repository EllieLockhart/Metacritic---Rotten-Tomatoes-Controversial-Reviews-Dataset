Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie but can't. \\nThe choices they made for beloved characters were just terrible\\, and Johnson seems to have just tossed out all the plot arcs set up by episode 7.  This movie was a heartbreak of missed potential.  I don't even know what they do from here with where they left the story. Just a disappointment and betrayal of the fans.","true":true}
