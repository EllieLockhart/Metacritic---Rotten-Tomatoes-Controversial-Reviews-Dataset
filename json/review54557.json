Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\u201cI\u2019m done with Star Wars forever!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never watch another Star Wars film!\u201d \u201cThis was the worst Star Wars film yet!\u201d Crybabies\\, crybabies\\, crybabies. That\u2019s who all of these negative reviews come from. I\u2019d estimate all the hate for this film by fans comes from those who are still upset because they thought Episodes I-III were going to be as amazing as IV-VI. Guess what? It\u2019s impossible that ANY Star Wars movie will live up to IV\\, V\\, and VI. Impossible. And guess what else? VII-IX won\u2019t be that awesome either and it isn\u2019t because of plot holes\\, poor writing\\, or perceived unnecessary scenes. Why? Because every Star Wars fan who started out with Eps IV\\, V\\, and VI has automatically romanticized these films to the point to where anything less than those expectations is unacceptable. Like many lifelong Star Wars fans\\, I was 3 years old when I saw Ep IV in the theater in 1977. It was magic! Then I was 6 and 9 respectively when I watched V and VI in theaters in the early 80s\\, it was even more exciting for me. The chances of my mind being blown at 3\\, 6\\, and 9 was significantly greater than when I was 25 in 1999 or 31 in 2005 or 42 in 2015 or 44 in 2017! Putting the expectations of the next Star Wars movie on a pedestal and comparing any new installments to the films you watched in your most impressionable years is absolutely ridiculous. Looking back on the franchise\\, The Last Jedi was the 5th or 6th best film of the 9 in the franchise. It\u2019s significantly better than The Force Awakens\\, seemingly similar to Rogue One\\, and better than Solo . Only Eps IV through VI are more than marginally better than Ep VIII. I know most will disagree with me\\, but if each of these 9 films is examined for what they are individually\\, A New Hope doesn\u2019t stand up on its own. The Last Jedi could. And how would The Last Jedi fare in 1977\\, 1980\\, or 1983? If the VIII story with V characters had been introduced in 1980\\, as Ep V\\, fans would\u2019ve loved it. Again\\, the unfairness of being compared to your first loves is the challenge every Star Wars film faces. Rogue One was popular because it bumped right up into the beginning of A New Hope. If The Last Jedi could do that\\, it would be loved\\, too. It\u2019s not like Rogue One is far and away a significantly better film than The Last Jedi. It\u2019s not. Critics are right to rate this film as it has been. Fans who speak out against The Last Jedi in such an unnecessary way are just too spoiled and want these new films to be exactly how they want them. Sorry people\\, but heroes don\u2019t stay heroes forever. They eventually fall and are replaced. If you didn\u2019t see a tragic end coming at some point for Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia when it was announced all three would appear in The Force Awakens\\, then you missed the boat. ","true":true}
