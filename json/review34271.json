Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The 1st time I saw it\\, I was kind of taken back. I was looking for answers as a continuation of Force Awakens. I felt disappointed that it felt like 2 separate stories. it was a long movie with a lot of complex situations occurring. So\\, that made it difficult to process the first go around. However\\, the 2nd time\\, I saw it and enjoyed it much more. Scenes and storyline made sense. I was in as much shock of Luke's character. But\\, at the end\\, he was sure powerful doing what no Jedi has ever done - force projecting himself to defeat an enemy! I ound the movie to be well made. It was a powerful ending of one chapter and start of the next! I look forward to the next episode!","true":true}
