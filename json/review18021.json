Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the movie was very good. The story did a good job breaking the mold. The force awakens followed a story very similar to a new hope with different characters and a bigger death star. However this one borrows elements from both empire and return of the Jedi and does new things with them. It sets up the next movie very well and gives us a bit of that I don't know what to expect. The people complaining right now would have probably rather seen a remake of the original trilogy. I do not understand why so many people are so down on this movie. ","true":true}
