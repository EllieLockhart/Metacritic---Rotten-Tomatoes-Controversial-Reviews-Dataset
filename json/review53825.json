Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having now watched Rise of Skywalker\\, I like this movie less. Between this movie and that one\\, you will probably only like one or the other. This movie is a little slower\\, and is more character-focused\\, while Rise of Skywalker is faster and action-oriented. This one plays like a Disney movie\\, or a romance\\, where there's a moral and a happy ending\\, while Rise of Skywalker is more action-adventure\\, and I guess more open to interpretation. Try not to let political drama sway your opinion on either. They're both very good\\, but it's weird that they're in the same saga while being written for people who have decided that they're so different.\\nThe first one was great\\, though. Pretty much everybody agrees on that.","true":true}
