Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love how they give it a 90%\\, but LESS than 1\/2 of the people that have seen it liked it. The movie was pushing so much propaganda down our throats that I couldn't stand it. Plus the weak writing\\, plot holes\\, weakening of Luke\\, and over powering EVERY female role\\, and making every role of a man to either be evil or dumb. This movie was worse than Episode 1\\, yeah I said it! I love Jar Jar more than this pile.","true":true}
