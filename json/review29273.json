Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey is boring because she has no flaws or faults. Luke was an interesting hero because he had to grow over the course of three movies\\, and it took him time and effort to develop his Jedi powers.","true":true}
