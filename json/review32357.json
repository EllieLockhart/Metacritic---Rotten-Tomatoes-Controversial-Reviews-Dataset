Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars is back in business. Sure there is controversy\\, but no controversy means you just get the same story over and over. The first movie to make real twists since the original trilogy\\, thebkast jedi gambles and wins.","true":true}
