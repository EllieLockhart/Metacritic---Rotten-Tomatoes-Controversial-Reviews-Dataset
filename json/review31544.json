Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much cinematic awesomeness is packed into Star Wars: The Last Jedi. We owe thanks to director Rian Johnson for the 2.5 hour run time\\, for making bold choices to take the saga and its characters in new\\, unexpected directions where I cannot predict how it will end. The Force is truly awakened. May it never go back to sleep!","true":true}
