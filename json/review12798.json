Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not expect to be surprised\\, several times even\\, by a Star Wars-movie. Nor did I expect to laugh\\, for the right reasons\\, many times. It's not perfect\\, but it is by far the best Star Wars-movie since Empire.","true":true}
