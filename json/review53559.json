Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent film - one of the best in the franchise. RIan Johnson is finally taking the story into new directions while paying their due to the past generations. A great send-off and rebirth!","true":true}
