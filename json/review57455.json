Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was not what I would have expected it to have been\\, but I like that. I had no issues with the length or the humor\\, as Star Wars movies have always been a little wonky and crazy. The return of a certain character from the past is the absolute best version of this character on film to date and was a wonderful bit of hope in the movie. While I certainly understand the criticism of Luke Skywalker's arc and agree with it\\, I don't really understand the criticism behind the rest of the story. This isn't the final film. You are not meant to have all the answers by now. This story is about failure\\, the fact that not everything is the way it may seem initially\\, that even the good guys are not immune from screwing up and how we deal with that and move on. It also established an intriguing new relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey that will be interesting to see played out in the next movie.\\n\\nOverall\\, this film does have a few issues but feels bigger\\, better\\, and more fleshed out than The Force Awakens. The acting was better\\, the characters felt more genuine\\, and it didn't feel like a rehash of movies we've already seen. It should be viewed with patience and attention as the dialogue and visual details are important in this movie\\, and maybe that's partly why audiences are taking issue with this film. I've seen many negative reviews left by people who didn't understand or didn't pay attention to what was happening in the movie\\, but that is not the movies fault. This is a very good Star Wars film that is worth watching on the big screen.","true":true}
