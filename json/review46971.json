Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a boring movie with plot and story holes throughout. \\n\\nKylo and Ren fighting all the red crimson guard hand to hand but they can raise boulders and throw people with the force? Why didn't they just wave their arms and through the crimson guard to the side? \\n\\nAlso who cares about kylo Ren?

Even the resistance going to a planet made.of snow like the other system. \\n\\nPlease stop making these movies they almost begin to diminish the middle 3.","true":true}
