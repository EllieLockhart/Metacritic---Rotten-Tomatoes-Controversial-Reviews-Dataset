Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"should have been called \\\"The Assassination of Star Wars by the Cowardly Disney\\\"\\, it's a Marvel movie with Star Wars name slapped to it\\, ruining old characters forever while never developing the new ones introduced in TFA. Certified fresh just like the turd i just dropped.","true":true}
