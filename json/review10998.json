Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Heads up\\, my real rating is a 4\\, but with so many giving it a half star because of multiracial characters or silly humor (which appeared in the originals too)  I felt the need to counter balance this with positivity. The movie is very good and very exciting. Lots of unexpected twists and new additions to the force! I liked that they went for it and gave us a movie that isn't just a complete rehash (the force awakens). Some of the scenes felt a bit long and unnecessary (Finn and rose at the casino) but overall a very entertaining film with lots of great new characters! I hope all of you whinny 40+ year old men can get over the fact that they adding new things to Star Wars and diversity to the cast. Grow up and just enjoy the film. :)","true":true}
