Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely fantastic such an improvement from force awakens this movie completely captivates Luke from the extended universe and truly show the power kylo and Rey posses the only bad part was the casino scene it felt a little useless and took longer than it should the Crait scene where rose doubles Finns speed and hits him from the side is sweet but also kinda made me go \\\"I'm sorry huh\\\"","true":true}
