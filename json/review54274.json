Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give this a solid \\\"MEH\\\". There are some really great scenes. Some of them could have used a little more explanation. Then\\, there are far too many filler sequences; scenes thrown in for seemingly no reason but to make up time. The plot wears a bit thin about 45 minutes in and this same story could have been told in 90 minutes\\, instead of 152.\\nPossibly one of the best parts\\, is the continuation of Lucas-style humor. \\nDaisy Ridley turns in her usual \\\"I have very little personality\\\" performance a la Kristen Stewart . Adam Driver seems to be falling into the Hayden Christensen territory of extremely stiff performance (I can't honestly call it acting). Oscar Issac's Poe\\, suffers from poor writing. Mark Hamill seems to have phoned in his performance as Laura Dern. John Boyega returns with another solid performance as Finn\\, who seems to know far more about the inner workings of the First Order for just a janitor turned Stormtrooper. The two brightest spots in the cast\\, were filled by Benicio del Toro\\, who turned out a great foil\\, and Kelly Marie Tran\\, whose fangirl character Rose may have been the best part played. \\nSpecial effects were as always superb\\, as was the soundtrack. The story was by and large too choppy and sloppy. It will be purchased on DVD\\, only so that I can have the full series for a later binge watching.","true":true}
