Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I cannot express how deep my disappointment was in this movie.  The plot was full of holes and the dialogue was atrocious.  It was a slow speed car chase in space according to my son.  I think what was done to the character of Luke was criminal and I cannot fathom who thought the whole casino sequence worked with this movie.  I had so much hope for this movie and it was dashed.","true":true}
