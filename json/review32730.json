Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens ends and picks it up in a wonderful way. Every movie has it's problems and this movie is no exception\\, but overall is a great addition to the Star Wars narrative.","true":true}
