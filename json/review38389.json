Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie of the franchise so far.. It's a disjointed mess of a movie. Characters are not developed at all\\, their backstory is not explored and the motivations for their change in character\\, namely Luke\\, are laughable an d totally unbeleivable. Luke's fall could have been fantastically dramatic but instead\\, like the rest of the movie was a damp squib. The villains in the movie are buffoons and parodies\\, therefore providing  no sense of threat to our heroes but that's ok because our heroes have no journey or development to make  us care about them anyway.\\nThe film is a sequence of repeated underdog action scenes occurring in slightly different  scenarios with a few minutes of conversation in the most shallow attenmpt at character development ever witnessed in a film. Bad storytelling with virtually no plot\\, paper thin characters and no arc. The movie is visually spectacular but ultimately just very\\, very dull. It's hard to think where the time went seeing as nothing really happened.","true":true}
