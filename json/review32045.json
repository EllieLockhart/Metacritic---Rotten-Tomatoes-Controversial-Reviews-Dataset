{"101487":169482,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***Spoilers***\\n\\nIn short this movie\\, albeit directed by Rian Johnson\\, was another Jar Jar Abrams style unoriginal hack job copy paste from its predecessors; jam packed with special effects\\, prospective toy animals and story ideas of people who I presume\\, think that they are clever and\/or special\\, but to their own detriment are not.\\n\\nWhat Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy & Co. did in the Last Jedi is berserk tabula rasa butchery of not only the original trilogy but their own work TFA as well\\, in terms of consistency and story.\\nSure they have to sell new books and create newer cooler characters\\, and when they can't they just make the old ones uncool to make the new ones look cool\\, if that makes any sense.\\n\\nLet's go deeper.\\nFirst of all\\, as far as Star Wars goes\\, I like the original trilogy a lot and respect it\\, \\nI really disliked the Force Awakens because of its mock-Emperor and Darth Vader wanna be villains\\, its Mary Sue protagonist and the script which was copy pasted from \\\"A New Hope\\\". But if I was to develop a sequel to TFA I would have to respect it even if I do not like it and keep it consistent.\\n\\nBut this film though\\, I hate it. Yep very strong words I know but unlike the film my feelings are sincere. I feel like Disney thinks that they can get away with any chance they take with the franchise because fans will flock to the theaters no matter what and throw away their money.\\n\\nI did not like the \\\"Lost\\\" style building up of intrigue and mystery Jar Jar tried to pull off regarding Snoke and Rey's origins and reasons for Luke's reclusion in the Force Awakens\\, and it is evident in this movie that they did not think it through in TFA to have any developed story or ideas about them then. Abrams\\, Kasdan & Arndt were just winging it. And evidently when Kathleen Kennedy and Co. & Rian Johnson decided they cannot wing it in this movie\\, heck they just kill the people \/ ideas off without explanation. For instance:\\n\\n-\tQuickly they make Ren smash his mask. Yay no longer a Vader copy\\, he's a real boy now.\\n\\n-\tAgain quickly\\, snoke is killed by Whino Ren\\, while bragging how supreme he is (and we still did not learn who the bleep this guy was in the first place).\\n\\n-\tLastly and in 10 seconds we learn that Rey's childhood is a byproduct of bad parentage by insignificant no name junk collectors.\\n\\nBut the worst for me is the guy we love for being able to overcome the dark side and refused to kill his fallen father which in turn led to the Emperor's undoing\\, Luke Skywalker\\, according to this movie freaked out upon sensing the dark side in Ben Solo and tried to kill him in his sleep\\, just for a moment. The guy who stood for optimism and was literally \\\"the New Hope\\\" who redeemed the unredeemable bad guy Vader\\, reduced to a hermit that turned his back on his loved ones\\, and killed off Obi Wan style\\, with the most ridiculous new force power of projecting interstellar holograms. Dude please.\\n\\nAnother major issue I have with this movie is that Disney\\, Rian Johnson or whomever is ridiculously desperate to be perceived as politically correct\\, diverse and inclusive; but in the end they come out as insincere since they just shove down an unnecessary parallel and nonsensical story arc of Finn and Rose with a little social commentary on capitalism\\, which is rich coming from Disney. As you know Disney has a rich history of depicting minorities (!).\\n\\nSuffice it to say I will not be paying Disney for anything from now on. I probably won't watch a Rian Johnson movie either.\\n\\nAnyhow if you're still reading lest make a soft exit by listing minor but nevertheless still very annoying stuff about the film:\\n-\tIf you really wanted a Lando type character\\, here's an idea why didn't you just put Lando in the movie. Mr. Williams is alive and well last I checked.\\n\\n-\tYou call that jedi training?\\n\\n-\tLuke milking an alien and drinking it caveman style?\\n\\n-\tI didn't see a point in the character Vice Admiral Holdo.\\n\\n-\tI still don't see the point of the character Maz Kanata.\\n\\n-\tForce skyping of Whino Ren and Rey\\, I'm no millennial nope\\, not for me.\\n\\n-\tForced Marvel style humor every 2 minutes\\, I don't even like it in Marvel movies either.\\n\\n-\t1 ewok type cg animal to be sold as toys is unbearable\\, 3 is just repugnant.\\n\\n-\tDamned Disney killed of Admiral Akbar.\\nAnd on and on and on...","true":true}
