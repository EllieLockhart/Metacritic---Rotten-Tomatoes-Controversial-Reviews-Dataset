Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of my favorite Star Wars movies\\, I won't go over everything I loved but I will say some specific things. \\n\\nSPOILERS\\n\\nOk so the main things I want to say is that the long timeline with Finn and Rose was NOT useless! This timeline set up the whole part where the Empire discovers the transports and kills off most of the resistance. Also it sets up how Po is a complete idiot because he's the one who told them and their hacker buddy (who was the one who told the empire).","true":true}
