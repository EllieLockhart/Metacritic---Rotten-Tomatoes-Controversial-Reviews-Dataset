Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i had two major issues with this movie.  First was how Luke Skywalker was handled.  It was certainly not with care.  Yes\\, he became one with the force and that was great.  His character didn't feel like it evolved into anything but rather\\, simply re-written to be another person.  Luke was always my favorite character.  I should have felt something when he died.  Instead ...nothing.  Not a thing.\\n\\nMy second major complaint was Fin's character.  Why didn't he matter?  He was a great character in TFA and added to the advancement of the plot.  In this movie\\, he was used to prop up a weird social agenda.  \\n\\nAlso\\, every man in this movie was made to look like a total fool at some point.  I didn't get that.  I was happy to see Leia in charge and kicking ass\\, but that didn't mean that all the male characters had to look like losers in one way or another.\\n\\nNeither of my kids (7 and 8) have mentioned the movie since we saw it.  Good Luck on that next generation you banked everything on.","true":true}
