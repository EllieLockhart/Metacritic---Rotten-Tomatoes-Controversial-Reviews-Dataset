{"101487":140557,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think I can explain the difference in response between the critic's views of The Last Jedi and the audience's response. The movie gives us a number of exemplary scenes including the battle in the Snope's throne room\\, General Holo's jump to hyperspace and Luke's version of \\\"Helm's Deep\\\". Visually stunning\\, these are some of the best scenes we have ever seen in a Star Wars movie. \\nIf you don't think too much about the movie and are simply trying to answer the question\\, is this movie worth seeing? You will likely think of these scenes and have the critic's response- yes\\, it's good. But fans DO think about the movie. And as soon as you do\\, the movie doesn't just disappoint you\\, it makes you angry.\\nIt disappoints because it is lazy storytelling. The three narrative arches make no sense time-wise\\, the characters\\, both good and bad\\, lack imagination and needlessly create problems for themselves that defy logic and are transparently plot devices. With few exceptions\\, the humour of the film consists in a couple of cringe-worthy gags and Leia's resurrection which was so poorly done it became funny. There are more than a couple of coincidences that move the plot forward and ultimately the story relies far too much on deus ex machina (or BB8 developing super-powers)  to save the so-called \\\"good\\\" guys. \\nAnd this is where disappointment gives way to anger. People are angry because Rian Johnson has decided to introduce moral complexity to the Star Wars universe. The Last Jedi teaches us that there isn't so much difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Luke Skywalker isn't above murdering a sleeping child and Kylo Ren can't bring himself to kill his mother. Profiteers sell weapons to both Resistance and the First Order and both Kylo Ren and Yoda are ready to destroy the past to build the future. While this may be more true to life\\, it raises the question- why should we care about the success of the Resistance? If we see\\, as we do throughout this film\\, that the Resistance is full of flawed\\, incompetent characters is it any wonder why their distress call goes unanswered? If our heroes aren't really heroic- noble\\, brave\\, intelligent\\, strong and caring- then why should we be rooting for them to win? Why should we have EVER cared?\\nThese are not the questions a film critic is likely to ask when they are given the job of reviewing a film\\, but these are the questions that are bothering Star Wars fans in the aftermath of the Last Jedi. Rian Johnson has diminished people's love of the franchise and turned off a lot of long-time fans.","true":true}
