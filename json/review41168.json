Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has great visuals and if your looking for a good action sci-fi you will love this movie HOWEVER if you are looking for a great STAR WARS movie look else where this movies give no thought to any previous Star Wars movie when creating a story or shape it's character in fact this movie spits straight into the face of George Lucas and any  Star Wars fan looking for Star Wars movie a true stain on the franchise.","true":true}
