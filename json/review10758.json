{"101487":126972,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hamill is a creative genious and his opinions should have been taken seriously. I think it is noteworthy that his performance in this latest film is Oscar worthy. His acting is the best part of that movie. It is not his fault the director ignored his opinion and he did what any professional would\\, voiced it and then did what the higher ups directed\\, even if it made zero sense and ignored thirty years of history. If his opinion never got out us fans would have the same opinion. Sounds to me like this director and the rest of the higher ups are looking for scapegoats instead of genuinely reflecting on the shit show they forced him to star in. First they blamed the alt right\\, now they are blaming the actor instead of taking responsibility and a hard look in the mirror. I remeber watching the directors cut of one of the old spiderman movies because I was curious how a movie that had such potential could come out so awful. The director said he could have told THE spiderman story but instead chose to use the oppotunity to tell HIS story with the spiderman characters. We all know how that flop turned out. That is what this most recent star wars movie is. It is not THE star wars story us fans were chomping at the bit for. It is the directors story\\, HIS story with the star wars characters. One that left us fans who would have watched THE star wars movie in the theatre several times this holiday season instead sitting on social media venting about feeling disenfranchised . Let me put it this way\\, the last two star wars movies I watched from disney I went the first time with the guys\\, the second time as a date\\, and the third with family. Typically\\, my girl wants me to spoil it for her after I watch it with the guys\\, then she gets excited from the spoilers and we go together as a date. This time\\, when I told her princess Leia was flying around like Mary Poppins\\, Ren is the daughter of nobody\\, Snope was anticlimacticlly ended without any real story\\, then they killed off Captain Phasma instead of developing the character\\, and Luke didn't try to restore the Jedi order\\, my girlfriend who has gone to see every other starwars movie Disney released just said\\, \\\"Nope. We are not going to see it.\\\" That is not Hamill's fault. She doesn't even know Mr. Hamill's opinion of the movie. So how are they blaming him?  This last jedi story sucks worse than Jar Jar Binks\\, which is really saying something. It is outrageous that Hamill not only wasn't brought in as an advisor while writing this script  but his opinion was straight up ignored. Trying to blame him for this train wreck of a movie is beyond the pale. As I said\\, his phenomenal acting was the only saving grace of this film. I would blame the director but there is plenty of blame to go around\\, however; Mark Hamill deserves none of it. After I told my girl Mr. Hamill called it great she said\\, \\\"fine\\, but we are still not going to see it. We can watch it from the comfort of my couch.\\\" Hamill's outstanding performance is the only reason I am still persistently  begging my girl to go watch it with me again at the theater. The scene where he drank the milk was priceless. He nailed it. But even if you can forgive the direction the director took Luke\\, there is still Leia flying around like Mary Poppins. There is still the big Snope let down which nobody (but the director) wanted\\, there is still the lack of character  development in killing off Captain Phasma. There were just a ton of other let downs. After watching it I read the directors interview about the backlash. The director essentially said\\, \\\"fuck you\\\" with a smile to all of the fans he knew he dissapointed. The directors philosophy that you can't please them all is fundamentally flawed. Just because you can't please them all doesn't mean you shouldn't try. And it certainly doesn't make it okay to write a movie you know will dissapoint the franchise's fans. This director may be great at directing but he\/they suck at writing star wars. I have to question the leadership at Disney\\, if you are getting ready to unveil an immersive starwars based resort\\, now is not the time to have an unapologetic director say\\, \\\"fuck you\\\" with a smile to the fans. I shouldn't have to be begging people to go see this movie with me again\\, I never had to with other star wars movies. That isn't Mr. Hamill's fault\\, his amazing acting skills are the only reason I am begging people to go watch this movie with me again. And only people who have seen the movie and are as upset by this story as me are geeky enough to know what Mr. Hamill said. Everyone else just had the plot spoiled and were so disappointed by the story they don't want to see it. Mark Hamill is litetally the star of star wars. And he did a kick ass job. This movie is considered great by the mainstream citics because of Mark Hamill's performance. He has nothing to apologize for but is still apologizing. The writers should be apologizing\\, and their supervisors. Not the star whose performance made the movie great. Instead of apologizing or reflecting on what star wars fans expect\\, the writers\/director are hiding behind misused idioms and scapegoats.  IJS","true":true}
