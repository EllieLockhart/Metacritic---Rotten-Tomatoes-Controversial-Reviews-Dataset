Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Let the past die\\\". The Last Jedi isn't afraid to throw out the tried and true Star Wars formula for something new that challenges you to question your exiting ideas about the Force and the Jedi. It says that where characters came from isn't as important as who they became. I loved it.","true":true}
