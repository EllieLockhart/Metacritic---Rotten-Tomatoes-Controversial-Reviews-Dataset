Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The major grievance I think everyone has over TLJ is the complete disconnect from the Star Wars universe. As a stand alone film it could be decent at best but the reality is there is established character personality\\, lore\\, mythology\\, and history that spans 8 movies which TLJ simply failed to capture. The limits of what the force can and can't do over 8 films were completely ignored such as Leia force surviving\\, and Luke dying of \\\"exhaustion\\\". The carry over from episode 7 has Poe a brilliant tactician\\, pilot\\, and leader become an idiot. Finn a deserter who becomes a hero and force for good in the resistance go back to being a deserter after saving the galaxy. Admiral Akbar\\, a fan favorite\\, getting killed off screen so an unknown vice admiral can get screen time. And finally Luke MIA giving up on an island somewhere the entire movie until he dies alone. This director shift from 6 to 7 was very noticeable to the audience. All of the setup from with the dream sequence of Rey's parents\\, the knights of Ren\\, and Snoke's history\\, were abandoned and unaddressed. In the wake of this movie being a trilogy the film is set up as a finale instead of a middle act. Adding several characters that bring nothing to the plot midway in a trilogy is a bad idea for any film production. Rose and Holdo's characters were forced and honestly completely useless to the storyline. Now the film being entertaining or fun\\, frankly put\\, just isn't good enough. When you have control of the biggest Hollywood franchise in existence ignoring everything that occurred in the previous 8 films is a fast way to disenfranchise your fan base\\, which is exactly what happened. I'm more than open to hear arguments for what made it a good film because so far all I've heard are \\\"I loved it\\\" or \\\"it was entertaining\\\" without an explanation as to why. And I think if anyone\\, not just Star Wars fans sits down critically and tries to place TLJ in the storyline of the Star Wars saga as opposed to a stand alone film\\, they will find TLJ simply falls short.","true":true}
