Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted opportunity to continue Star Wars lore. Weak characters and contrived subplots that do little to push to overall storyline forward. It could work as a TFA part 2\\, but doesn\u2019t really do much as a sequel in a trilogy. ","true":true}
