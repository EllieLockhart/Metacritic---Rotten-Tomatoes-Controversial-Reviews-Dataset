Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A deep interpretation of the Star Wars Universe. This movie is about people. It isn't about Star Wars. It's an actual story of these people and how these things effect them and the ones they love. It's about finding their place in the madness of everything and how to come together to win what's fighting for. There is conflict within themselves and the other characters. I personally think their are parts that takes the movie back a little but is brought back up with scenes following. I personally look at these films as trilogy's and whether or not the whole arch is fulfilled. It's hard to do so with each film coming out every 2 years but I really think The last Jedi stands it's ground and offers something different and these movies need that. I don't want to see an Empire type movie because I would just go watch empire. Personally a solid film\\, may need to be watched twice to catch everything because it does throw a lot st you and a first viewing with someone carrying all those theories and expectations leaves you a little disconnected. 4\/5 will see for a third time while in theaters. It's the most different Star Wars story and I have high hopes episode 9 will complement both tfa and talk and this will be a great trilogy.","true":true}
