Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This make the prequels look like citizen cane. Is like if in the Lord of the rings Frodo become into an assasin\\, legolas fights for sauron and gimli shaved his beard. Just imposible things with these characters and story. There is absolutely nothing to watch in ep 9\\, there is no bad guy\\, the new empire doesnt have my respect\\, and none of the good guys deserve nothing.","true":true}
