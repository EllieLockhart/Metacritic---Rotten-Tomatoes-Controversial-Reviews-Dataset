Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Warning spoilers ahead!\\nI went to see this movie twice \\, the first time i saw it i liked it\\, dint love it but liked it \\, stunning visuals and i am a star wars fan i actually liked lukes development and here is why\\, as far as im concerned lukes character although ultimately good has always been a bit flirtatious with the dark side but has never really had a negative effect on him until the moment with kylo ren and this time it dint end well\\, luke is human it makes him interesting to have moments of weakness \\, to make a bad call because sure its always worked out before.\\nNow there where lots i dint like the first time i say it \\, the jokes where clunky\\, forced and out of place \\, i dint feel anything about lukes ending and the fin and rose story arc i could have completely done without\\, it was boring to watch\\, it dint go anywhere and the only interesting thing that surfaced that could have been touched on (that the weapon dealers are playing both sides ) gets smothered by rose a badly written character riddled with contradictions .\\nThen i watched it a second time \\, because it was the first star wars film i watched and was in all honesty uncertain how i felt about it\\, but this time i was aware of what happens \\, so i had time to take the film in completely and not be blown away by  brilliant visual moments . The film is ment summed up in kylo rens words of (lets the past die \\, kill it if you have to) and that is what the film does \\, kills the star wars legacy \\, its the retelling of the empire strikes back but every moment has a twist it takes every aspect of the franchise and M.night shyamalans it\\, which would have been fine if it made any sense.\\nYou step back from beautiful set peaces and find that none of the characters seem to be thinking \\, none of there choices seem to be rational and in some cases breaks character or even the general intelligence of all life in this universe and im looking at you general holdo miss im not telling a scared and desperate resistance on the verge of being erased what the general plan of action is for no other reason then  im the general and i should not have to explain what the plan is and then act shocked when others enact desperate plans and open mutiny against you \\, to one moment showing open disdain for poe dameron and then him giving you every reason to still dislike him but for some reason change your mind without explanation and then there is the light-speed visual spectacle \\, beautiful to watch but must mean that every single individual is as dense as a rock for no one on ether side any war since the invention of light-speed travel  to not go ( i know you like the shinny lasers BUT if we swap that out for these unmanned ships that travel and have them enter light speed close to the enemy ship it will tear a hole right through them \\, rinse and repeat till we have won ) .\\nThis film ruined star wars and not in an interesting progressive way\\, this film gives a big middle finger to the millions of longstanding star wars fans by not only showing no love for the original characters who ether die off screen or in lukes case gets lectured by rey who completely ignores anything he has to say and continues her mary sueness. But is also intentionally directionless \\, intentionally badly written and intentionally without substance mixed in with vague political agenda \\, yes animal cruelty is wrong but lets skip past and pretend we dint just witness child abuse and slavery .\\nyou want a visual spectacle this film is for you\\, you want a film that is reasonably compelling and leaves you exited about its next film then your going to hate this film","true":true}
