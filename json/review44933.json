Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Typical Hollywood now. Take something good and make it bad. Just like Saturday night live is no longer funny\\, Star Wars is not good. Weak characters\\, none are amazing like the old.  Rey\\, Finn\\, supreme leader\\, Kylo Ren are all bad characters with nothing special about them. It's typical bad Hollywood writers today\\, who either have a horrible political agenda to get thumbs up from liberal critics or just plain ruin a good thing. My wife thought it was entertaining somewhat but I was not feeling any of it. Really bad writing.","true":true}
