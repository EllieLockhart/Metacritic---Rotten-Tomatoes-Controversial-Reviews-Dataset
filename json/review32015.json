Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Exec 1: Luke gonna die this episode Exec 2: cool so he's going to have a heroic last stand and sacrifice himself to save everyone? Exec 1: No. You're going to think that's about to happen but he's really just a projection that going to distract Kylo for a minute. Exec 2: so he lives? Exec 1: No he still dies. Exec 2: Perfect.
