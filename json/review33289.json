Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Superfans might whine but any sensible person would look at the visuals of this movie and be captured by the he magic of Star Wars that made you fall in love with it in the first place. THANK YOU RIAN JOHNSON for stunning\\, imagination engineering scenes. I was thrilled!!","true":true}
