Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to rank the Last Jedi as awful. Rian Johnson ruined the film and probably destroyed the series as a whole\\, adding several surreal elements along with an apparent gravity in space.\\n\\nHe spit on the Skywalker line.\\nHe wasted good characters.\\nSpoiler warning.... He spit on everything that made Star Wars good.\\n\\nThere's a few things I enjoyed\\, like seeing Yoda again\\, and as a puppet and not some stupid CGI special effect. That was actually\\, the best part of the movie. The rest of the movie.... Falls flat on its face. If you don't believe me\\, go look at the backlash about it. I'd rank the movie along the lines of the prequels and the unneeded Rogue One.\\n\\nWonder how JJ is going to save this one and all this is calling into question about Rian Johnson doing the next films after 9.\\n\\nI certainly hope he drowns in the hate mail. A lot of people are not pleased with how he handled Star Wars\\, its characters\\, and even the parts where even the sci-fi takes a nose dive into the absurd.","true":true}
