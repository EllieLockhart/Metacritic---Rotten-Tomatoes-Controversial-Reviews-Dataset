Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Short and sweet: I hated what they did with this entry of this trilogy and I have almost no interest in seeing the next one. This is what happens when a corporation values money over art and creativity. But let's keep selling everything to them anyway. RIP my favorite franchise of all time.","true":true}
