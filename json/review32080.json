{"101487":169501,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS*\\n\\nTHE GOOD : COOL ACTION SCENES\\, CGI\\, DIRECTION\\, ACTING.\\n\\nTHE BAD : NO CHARACTER ARC FOR POE & FINN. LOUSY NEW CHARACTER \\\"ROSE\\\". NO ACTUAL JEDI TRAINING FOR \\\"REY\\\". EARLY SEND OFF OF \\\"SNOKE\\\". CAPT. PHASMA A PROP. LAURA DERN WASTED AS HOLDO. ITS OK TO DEFY EXPECTATIONS OF FANS IN \\\"REY's Lineage\\\"\\, \\\"Leia's jedi powers\\\" & \\\"Luke's Astral Stand Up\\\" but it fails to do justice to any of it.\\n\\nTHE WORST : OK HERE WE GO. Worst \\\"STAR WARS\\\" plot ever. THEY RUN OUT OF GAS ? WTH ? Poe wasted. Finn & Rose are in another movie altogether. That 20 - 25 min Casino scene could have been used for \\\"REY-LUKE\\\" scene. JJ gave emotional send off to HAN in TFA\\, but here LUKE \\\"THE HERO OF ORIGINAL HOLY TRINITY\\, THE SKYWALKER\\, THE JEDI MASTER\\\" is killed off just after 2 mins of standing. Not Fans but EVERYONE was hoping for one last epic stand up of \\\"LUKE against NEW ORDER\\\" saving the resistance but it was a let down of galactic proportions. Glaring plot holes. Ending was a bummer unlike TFA.\\n\\nSummary : Neither it expands the characters\\, ideas\\, mysteries from THE FORCE AWAKENS nor it brings anything new to table. It fails miserably to do justice to HOLY TRINITY.","true":true}
