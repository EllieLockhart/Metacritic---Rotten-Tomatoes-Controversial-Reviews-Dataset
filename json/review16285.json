Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to write a long thing about why this movie is so bad.\\, other people have already presented those points.  I'm not even angry anymore\\, just really\\, really disappointed to see where this genre is going. So sad what they did to the character of Luke","true":true}
