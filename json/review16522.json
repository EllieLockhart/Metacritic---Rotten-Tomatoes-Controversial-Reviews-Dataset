Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 2017 when movies that divide black and white sides in absolute ways with weak interpretations are already out-of-date\\, The Last Jedi gives us very fresh\\, complex perspectives toward star wars. The plot\\, as the 2nd movie of the trilogy\\, was reasonable. What drove this movie jaw-droppingly insane was the character developments\\, which need to be interpreted with the previous movie\\, The Force Awakens. All main characters became more reasonably round and complex. That's maybe why most fanboys are furious about this movie\\, as their all-time hero Luke Skywalker was portrayed to have more dimensions\\, more complexion of humanity that ruined their childhood Jedi knight hero. The subtext of this movie is that nothing is absolutely good or bad\\, which \\\"almost\\\" contradicts to what George Lucas has created in the originals that the Jedi is always good and the Sith is always bad. The best performance in this movie is definitely meaningful cinematic language and symbols and Rian tried to represented. \\n\\nTo conclude\\, if you watch it with nostalgic expectations\\, you're probably not gonna like it. However\\, If you watch it with a better sense of film interpretations\\, this movie can undoubtedly strike down The Empire Strike Back.","true":true}
