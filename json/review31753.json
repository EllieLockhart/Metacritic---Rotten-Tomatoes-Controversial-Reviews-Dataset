Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So this movie was not bad... but it was great either.... its weird if it was just a stand alone movie it kind of works but as a middle movie in a trilogy it doesn't the first movie build up so many ideas and left me rabid to find out the answers.... this movie basically says remember all those things you were looking forward to?  well BAM none of them mattered at all.... i mean when this movie was over it left me with like nothing to be excited for in a third movie.   There is nowhere to go except having them fight 2 villains who are terrible and easily beatable villains\\, why would i be excited about that?  it really and honestly seems like Rain Johnson looked at where JJ was going in terms of story and just said NOPE....","true":true}
