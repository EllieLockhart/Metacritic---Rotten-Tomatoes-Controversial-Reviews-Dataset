Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very different Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson took a lot of risks and went different directions from a lot of plot lines that were laid out in The Force Awakens. I think the majority of viewer dislike has to do with going into the movie with certain expectations of how the story should go. Don't do that\\, you WILL be disappointed. While I don't agree with the path some of the arcs went either\\, that doesn't mean they \\\"Suck\\\" or are \\\"trash\\\". There is one section that feels a little disjointed and I fear that's because of cuts to the film. At over 2 1\/2 hours long\\, Rian said his first cut was over 3 hours\\, I feel that they were forced to pear down the second act of the film\\, thus causing the clunky feeling I got from it. Overall a solid addition to the SW universe.","true":true}
