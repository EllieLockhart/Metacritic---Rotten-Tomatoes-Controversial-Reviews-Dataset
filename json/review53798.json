Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not quite as good as I could have hoped but that being said I didn't leave disappointed. I was surprised at every turn with Rian's creative choices (that can be good and bad) Did it destroy the momentum of the new trilogy...? no. Did it change everything we know about the franchise? Yes & No. This is the beginning of the end and we have JJ to tie up all the loose ends. Here's hoping that fans will get the finale they deserve. ","true":true}
