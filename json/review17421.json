Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie last week at a Star Wars fan experience. This is my first viewing impression.  There are many parts I really enjoyed and many others I could have done without.  Like the cute or cool looking CGI characters that had very little to no use in the story and the ladies on the island with Luke.  There was a lot in the movie that should have been cut out and other parts that should have been longer.  As much as i love Carrie Fisher they did not use her properly in either E7 or E8. Disney states that they had big plans for Carrie Fisher for episode 9.  This is proof to appreciate people when they are around\\, because you never know when you will no longer have them.  It's no Empire Strikes Back or even Rogue One. With a second viewing I'm sure it will be a solid 4 star movie.","true":true}
