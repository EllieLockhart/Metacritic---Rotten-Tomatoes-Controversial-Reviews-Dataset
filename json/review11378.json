Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible\\, disrespectful\\, uninformed\\, so bad is kinda of sad\\, waste of money and time\\, however\\, it was beautifully shot! The Last Jedi is the destruction of a Lore that has in a way shaped or at least inspired a generation. Rian hates Star Wars and he made it very clear. And anyone who disagree with what he has done is a racist\\, sexist\\, TOXIC FAN or... a bot. But like Simon Pegg said and everyone behind this ''movie'' that literally makes a living from trying  to make their art and characters matter to the audience in order to make money 'Is Just A F*cking Film and None of It Matters'","true":true}
