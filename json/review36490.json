Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie breaks away from some Star Wars cliches and delivers a breath of fresh air to the franchise. The Force Awakens is perhaps more exciting\\, but this one is certainly more original. Still\\, the core elements that make us love Star Wars are still there\\, so die hard fans can still delight. Some of the subplots are weak\\, some characters are underused and the movie is a bit too long - but\\, all in all\\, it's a good movie. Certainly better than the prequels and\\, for some\\, maybe even a new classic.","true":true}
