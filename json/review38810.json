Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They didn't do anything new with this movie\\, they just took all the memorable scenes and ideas of the Original Trilogy and re-ordered it. All that talk of letting go of the past and killing it was a dumb excuse to re-package EVERYTHING and hope nobody notices. Rey is Luke\\, Luke is Yoda\\, Kylo is Darth vader\\, Snoke is the Emperor\\, Poe is Han Solo and Rose and Fin are pointless. Ironically if they KEPT the past and BUILT ON IT we'd see NEW things like in the EU Legends Thrawn trilogy. We've never seen the FOUNDING of a Jedi order or the building of Lightsabers and Jedi rituals\\, not on the big screen. They had an opportunity for something New that was also timeless and they BLEW IT to re-package what we've seen.? And this is inexcusable\\, Star Wars is a vast Universe that begs for new possibilities but Disney literally preformed character assassinations of the original Characters to recreate the original story with younger actors which literally means the story has not progressed since the 70s and is going in circles.","true":true}
