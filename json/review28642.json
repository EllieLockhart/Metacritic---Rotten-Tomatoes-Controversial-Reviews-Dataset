Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros:\\n- Great visuals\\, sound effects\\, creative environments\\n- overall entertaining production\\n\\nCons:\\n- Does not live up to the buildup in Force Awakens\\n- Poor\/questionable plot\\n- Poor use of valuable time with the original Star Wars cast\\n- Did not emulate enough nostalgia for the classic Star Wars \u0093vibe\u0094 (felt like it was directed and written by someone who doesn\u0092t understand what made Star Wars such a success story). If you want to make a new take on Star Wars\\, don\u0092t call it Star Wars.\\n- one on one lightsaber battles: none\\n- questionable abrupt deaths\/non-deaths: plenty.","true":true}
