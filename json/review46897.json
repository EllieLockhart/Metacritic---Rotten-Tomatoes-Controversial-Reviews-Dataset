Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went in as a casual fan wanting to love this movie. I overall enjoyed episode 7 and was looking forward to further development in The Last Jedi. \\n\\nThis is my first movie review ever\\, I saw TLJ last night and i woke up still angry about this movie. Bad\\, out of place humor\\, complete disregard of the themes and suspense that the previous movies set up\\, and just straight up corny scenes (starting with leia in space) destroyed this movie for me. I'm absolutely astonished at the rave reviews it has been getting by critics. Why?!?!","true":true}
