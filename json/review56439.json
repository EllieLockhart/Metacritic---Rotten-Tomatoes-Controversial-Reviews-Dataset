Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The chosen one dies in failure and shame after making a hologram and pair o dice.... why?\\n\\nBecause of weak story telling.\\n\\nWhy destroy what we all loved? Why make the chosen one a hermit loser who gave up? Who is Snoke\\, other than someone the new director didn't like? Why save the rebellion when you can save one dude that will just be killed by AT-ATs? Why not use the force to open your eyes in the vacuum of sapce? Why not fly in space\\, dressed in a robe? Yoda! Where was this lightning when Luke was getting the ole shocker on Death Star 2 of 3? Why do you like this movie? I'm a fan of the past dying.... but why not just have a story line where the ones we loved have died of old age\\, not failure! I know this makes them more real\\, but if I wanted to see how real life ends\\, I'll watch a documentary not a space opera where I just want to see wizards with laser swords.This movie was slap in the face to all the affection I had toward the original trilogy.","true":true}
