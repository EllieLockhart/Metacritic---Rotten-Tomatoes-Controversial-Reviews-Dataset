Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Note\\, contains spoilers: Unlike so many out there that seem intent on sharing how their childhoods are destroyed\\, etc.\\, I am taking a road apparently less travelled\\, I loved this movie and my childhood remains nicely intact and cared for. I hope if Rian reads these reviews\\, that he will see mine and know this\\, YOU DID JUST FINE! I have seen Last Jedi twice now\\, and even scenes I thought felt odd or strange the first time\\, were needed to tell the story you set out to tell. I wouldn't change a thing! And I love Star Wars! All of them. I like George Lucas' prequels too. Even Jar Jar has a place in the universe that contains the greatest movie character of all time to me\\, Lord Darth Vader. His (Anakin's) tale is one for the ages\\, and this story\\, of his children\\, Luke AND Leia\\, and those affected by them\\, COMPLETES the Skywalker saga by showing us that Anakin was indeed the CHOSEN ONE\\, bringing balance to the Force\\, and that his offspring and those around him\\, CONTINUE his story\\, and will complete it\\, thanks to the unlikely cast of characters including Rey\\, Finn and Poe and yes\\, Ben\/Kylo Ren. I am amazed at how fun this third trilogy is\\, and how DIFFERENT and ENTERTAINING it all has been! Of course George's original three are the best\\, but they too contain often silly scenes with silly dialogue and sometimes stray from the core story\\, but WHO CARES! It's a STORY! I for one am grateful to those creating something fun and lasting\\, and will always be thankful for how respectfully the awesome last confrontation and passing of Luke was handled as well as keeping in all Carrie Fisher's amazing performance. I cannot wait to see how JJ Abrams finishes all this! I will be first in line\\, and I THANK Kathleen Kennedy and the rest of the tireless\\, modern Star Wars production crew! You've done the future proud. And again\\, Rian\\, IGNORE the complaints. Be your own artist. Answer only to your own creative drive! And to quote Carrie\/Leia\\, \\\"I am not a committee!\\\" The telling of these is not a democracy\\, it's from the creative mind. Thanks for the Lucas-like samurai movie references and for keeping it fun and visually and emotionally interesting. Thanks for growing it all up. Yoda is right\\, Failure is the best teacher. Luke had to get that one.  Glad you didn't fail us\\, Rian. Good job\\, So be it\\, JEDI!","true":true}
