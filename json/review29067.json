Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really liked the visuals\\, the creativity behind the aliens and planets\\, the space battles and that throne room fight near the end of the second act. It's like all the places where JJ Abrams wanted to take the story where destroyed. Wasted opportunity with Snoke\\, the knights of Ren and the Jedi mythos. That Casino subplot was garbage! Wasted opportunities. Rian is so much better than this. What happened??","true":true}
