Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it's always nice to have a new Star Wars film\\, The Last Jedi was exactly what I expected and thus disappointing. Suspense was built with overly-obvious slapstick humor instead of depth\\, subtlety\\, or fear for the characters. The movie generally lacked direction\\, as characters were sent off on side-quests that were obviously there to fill time. In general\\, I feel like The Last Jedi ends up somewhere closer to the prequels in the quality of it's story line and characters than the original films.","true":true}
