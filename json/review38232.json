Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were good but the story is the worst I have ever seen and I'm not just talking Star Wars. I am talking every movie I have ever seen. Rey is a god and can do no wrong and does not need to train. She is stronger than Anakin and Luke at that age without any explanation or training. The storylines were all over the place and did not make sense. When a person is in space suddenly\\, the lungs violently decompress and freeze shut form the moisture in the lungs freezing. Leia could not have survived\\, not to mention floating back to a ship that is supposed to be moving quickly. That is just one example of the  absolute stupidity brought to you by someone who had the time and the money\\, but just failed any sort of intelligence check. The Finn in TFA tries to run away but ends up becoming a hero. The Finn in TLJ I gets reverted back to coward and then suddenly becomes brave. Luke is completely disrespected as if Rian actually hated the character. Propaganda themes everywhere in a freaking Star Wars movie. Misuse of captain phasma.. hi I'm back.. oops I'm dead in like t minutes on screen. To top it off\\, if you disagree with the film you are a bigot! Seriously?? \\nI am threw with Disney Star Wars!","true":true}
