Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the movie that killed star wars.  I love strong female characters like Ripley or Sarah Connor\\, but Rey is not a strong character. She's a Marry sue.  Holdo didn't seem like any admiral I've ever seen in a movie before.  She didn't dress like one. she didn't act like one. I could go on\\, but I won't.  These are not strong women.  the comedy elements looked more at home in a spaceballs movie than star wars.  finn's suit leaking everywhere\\, the awful iron scene\\, poe mocking hux.  No\\, this is just poor writing and an attempt to be funny in the wrong way.  it didn't fit.  Seriously I was in total disbelief about the iron.  luke has been ripped to shreds like he didn't matter.  they built up snoke only to get rid of him before we actually found out anything about him.  phasma is a joke of a character.  chewie has no purpose.  the fleet chase scene was beyond stupid.  seriously?  the first order couldn't hyperspace right on top of them?  THeir fighters couldn't catch the fleet and wipe them out?  it was like they didn't even try to write a good movie.  If you want to shove sjw crap down my throat\\, you can at least make a good story to go with it.  The force awakens at least had redeeming qualities.  This garbage was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life\\, it was not the actors' fault.","true":true}
