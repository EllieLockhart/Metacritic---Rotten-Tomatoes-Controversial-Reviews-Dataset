Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So incredibly dissapointed with this movie. I woke up this morning after seeing it last night wishing it was a bad dream. During the movie there were several times where I was wondering if this was Candid Camera and the lights would come on and we'd all have a laugh and then they'd start the real movie. It certainly had its moments\\, but on the whole I am so dissapointed in this film. I tried\\, i tried really hard to like it\\, and kept telling myself \\\"it's gonna get better\\\"\\, and in some scenes it did. My wife told me \\\"i kept looking at your face and you looked so dissapointed\\\". I really hope when I see it again it'll grow on me\\, but my first impression is that I hated it.","true":true}
