Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No real story progression.  To tell a story is to tell a story\\, no story was told here.  The actors were excellent\\, music score was okay\\, and the cinematics were great.  This movie seems to set out against the grassroot fans. Call us fanbois\\, doesn't matter.  Without the fans\\, there is no Star Wars.  A fan I am not as of now.  The Target audiance is not the audiance that grew up watch\\, reading and playing Star Wars.  I am going back to the expanded universe. Also\\, I will be buying second books as I do not want to give Disney any more of my money.   lastly\\, this will be the first Star Wars movie I didn't go back to watch 4 -5 times at the theater.","true":true}
