Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, but this movie did something that those two didn't. It gave me the chance to leave the theater with the feeling of genuine surprise. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is bold\\, ambitious\\, and takes far more risks than one would ever assume going in to see a Skywalker Saga film. \\n\\nThere are a few flaws (as there are in every film)\\, and some of the creative choices will no doubt anger fans afraid of change. However\\, that doesn't take away from the incredible acting\\, character development\\, and fantastic action. \\n\\nIf you go into it accepting that every fan theory you've heard over the past two years doesn't come anywhere close to what actually happens in the movie\\, you're going to have a blast. Rian Johnson and company crushed it. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher have never been better\\, and Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are absolutely fantastic.\\n\\n4.5\/5","true":true}
