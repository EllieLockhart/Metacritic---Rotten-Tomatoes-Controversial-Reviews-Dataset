Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lot's of good actors\\, but a bad depiction of luke skywalker as a cowardly old man needing to be prodded into correcting the situation he created or at least failed to clearly prevent. Too many plot holes\\, and why the hell would finn be trying to escape again?? that didn't make any sense whatsoever\\, among other silly things that got half-assed developed regarding finn and his triangle love interest.. ugh.  Love finn\\, should have made him a jedi...  One of the worst star wars movies. i doubt i'll be rushing out to see any further installments\\, and i've seen all of them.","true":true}
