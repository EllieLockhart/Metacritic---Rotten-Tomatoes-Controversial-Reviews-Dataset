Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Failed Character development\/expenditure.  Too many plot holes.  Failed follow up on all set ups from the previous movie.  Failed closure to Luke\\, Admiral Akbar....etc.  Snoke... was set up well\\, but they failed to come through... WHO IS SNOKE!?  Benicio del Torro's character was well played (I think he is an amazing actor) but was so limited.  Who is this new smuggler\/slicer character...? I am truly disappointed in this film and I hated it.","true":true}
