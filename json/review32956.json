Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story is weak while movie is entertaining and visually appealing. Not having George Lucas sign off on the story makes 7 and 8 fall apart. I like the first 6 and the Clone Wars as well as Rogue One.","true":true}
