Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst star wars movie ever made. Luke Skywalker's character was totally ruined. Force sexting between Rey and Kylo was awful. Snoke was a joke. Rose\\, Finn & DJ part was completely pointless to the whole \\\"plot\\\". So many problems with actual space physics (Leia flying & bombers wtf)\\, story line and character development. Let a star wars fan boy write a script or something at least we would have had a Luke vs Snoke or Kylo lightsaber fight and not a hologram with real Luke pooping himself on a rock.  My hope is that JJ Abrams starts episode 9 with Rey asleep on the millennium falcon and waking up only to realize the events of the last jedi were a horrible dream then she walks up the steps to give Luke his old lightsaber and he doesn't throw it over his shoulder like I wish I could do to this movie.","true":true}
