Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WTF was this garbage?!\\nJust seen it and I have no words... need to collect my thoughts as there was just too much crap-fest to take in and process. \\nWorst SW movie by a mile! Phantom Menace was Citizen Kane next this garbage!","true":true}
