Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I was literally tearing up much of the movie. So many great characters we love and new ones\\, so much action and twists that it was like 1 1\/2 or 2 movies instead of one.  Definitely not a disappointment for Star Wars fans!  Can't wait to see it again:).","true":true}
