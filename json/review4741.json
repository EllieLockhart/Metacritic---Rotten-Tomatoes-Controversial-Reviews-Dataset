Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely disregards all questions we asked after the first movie. Jedi can now Skype through the force. Leia can survive a ship blowing up hold her breath in the vacuum of space and use the force to fly\\, I won't be at all surprised if they pull a \\\"vader survived the death star\\\" with the same cop out. Snoke is less relevant than Jar Jar Binks. Slap stick comedy was just madness\\, rey getting tickled by luke (who turned into a massive bitch\\, and died using force Skype for some unexplained reason) Few alright scenes in the movie but they are ruined by cheesy one liners. Will not be doing a midnight release for the next one.","true":true}
