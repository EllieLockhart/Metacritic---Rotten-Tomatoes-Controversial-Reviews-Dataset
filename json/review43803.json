Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was very boring. I absolutely cannot stand Rey. Her character is so flat and not well developed at all. This movie also lacked the action scenes that made the past Star Wars movies great. I did not like what they made Luke Skywalker into either. This was the worst installment in the franchise since The Phantom Menace. Rian Johnson should not be allowed to direct another Star Wars movie again","true":true}
