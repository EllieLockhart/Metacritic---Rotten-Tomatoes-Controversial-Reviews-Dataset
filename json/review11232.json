Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly I was sorely disappointed.  The movie was bland\\, generic\\, and lacked passion.  There two places in the movie where it was just unbelievable what happened\\, as in too unrealistic.  The magic is gone\\, I'll tell you.  This is nothing more than an industrial monstrosity turned out from Disney's fabrication's plant.  The movie lacks soul\\, and hence enthusiasm.  Some of the plot twists were good.  But overall I can't recommend this bloated exercise in over-dramatization.  If I had one word to describe this movie it would be over-dramatized.  Feels somehow appropriate to a world on the edge of chaos anyhow.","true":true}
