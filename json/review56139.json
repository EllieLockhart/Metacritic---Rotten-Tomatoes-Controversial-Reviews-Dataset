Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoiler FREE Review I don\u2019t understand the backlash from the audience especially because of how hypocritical it is. Everyone complained about The Force Awakens being too familiar and derivative\\, but got upset when they got what they wanted: something fresh and new. This film had the right balance of expanding and adding to the Star Wars mythos\\, while remaining true to the franchise in the right places. This was classic Star Wars\\, but also gave it the shake up the franchise needed. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the film\\, it definitely has its flaws and isn\u2019t at all perfect\\, but there wasn\u2019t a moment I didn\u2019t have fun watching it. The comic relief was enjoyable and eased the tension of the drama in the right places. The plot was overall exciting. Some of the subplots and Laura Dern\u2019s new character didn\u2019t end up mattering that much to the main plot\\, but the scenes for those subplots were still entertaining. There were a few disagreements I had with some choices for some scenes\\, but none affected much of the story. At the end of the day\\, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the third best Star Wars movie.","true":true}
