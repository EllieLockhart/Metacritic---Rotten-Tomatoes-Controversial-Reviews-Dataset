Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as I expected. Too much CGI\\, too much goofy humor! Still way better than the prequels by a long shot\\, and still overall good. I don't know\\, I'll see it a couple more times. Maybe I just expected too much.","true":true}
