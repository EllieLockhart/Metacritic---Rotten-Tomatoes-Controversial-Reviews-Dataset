Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have lost faith in the Star Wars franchise and Rotten Tomatoes. This film was awful in so many ways.   Any critic who says otherwise should go read a story or view a good film and then flog yourself for sinning against good judgement.   The characters are vapid and forgettable\\, or even hatable\\, including those that we know from earlier films.  There is no plot to speak of and no chemistry between characters.  And so little mention of the Force except a few trite \\\"may the Force be with you\\\"s.  I fell asleep a few times due to the pace only to awake each time to a rehash of the Death Star final run scene.  Just take out that cannon; just take out that Star Destroyer\\, just take out that \\\"fill in the blank\\\".  And while doing so let's chock scenes full of markedly marketable creatures which have no point.  The dialogue contains to much modern commentary.   Go back to storytelling.  I may never watch another Star Wars movie again.  By the end o wanted the whole SW universe to implode into a black hole and disappear from my memory.  so sad.","true":true}
