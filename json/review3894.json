Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boldly takes the story in many unexpected directions\\, but fails to continue the Star Wars legacy. Fans of the franchise will feel rightly angered over the treatment of the original hero\\, Luke Skywalker ... who turns out to be a coward that chooses to face the enemy via force Skype. Would it have been too difficult to give fans what they wanted ... an epic battle between Luke and Snoke in this film or the next? Instead\\, both are squandered in the movie's snub of the franchise's story arc and mythos.","true":true}
