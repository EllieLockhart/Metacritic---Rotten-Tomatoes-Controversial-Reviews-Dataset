Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's all side story. There's no plot good enough to be a main plot. And all the side plots are full of plot holes and come to nothing interesting. The entire cast are supporting characters. There's no character good enough to be the lead. The only characters who stand out do so for all the wrong reasons. Poe is actually the only character I didn't come out disliking. The movie is boring\\, it's mundane\\, and some of the plot holes it opens up actually bleed into the larger Star Wars universe. It makes the other movies in the franchise worse just by existing. It's painfully long. It should end at least an hour before it actually does. You spend the entirety of the movie waiting for the good part to start\\, and it never comes. It's just unrelenting mediocrity.","true":true}
