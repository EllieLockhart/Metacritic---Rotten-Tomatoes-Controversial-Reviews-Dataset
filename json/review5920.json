Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing is an understatement. \\nThere were too many plot holes and lack of character development\/explanation. \\nGreat villains and heroes were killed off in the least epic manor possible. This movie could have been great\\, but any mystery JJ presented in the Force Awakens was quickly snuffed out.    Perhaps Star Wars is salvageable\\, but most likely not....there is nothing left that excites me enough to see the next film in theaters.","true":true}
