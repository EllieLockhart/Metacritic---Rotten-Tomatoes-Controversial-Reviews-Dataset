Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had many potential moments of greatness. It seemed to have mastered the art of building up to the climax only to trash it completely with no payoff. The legacy of this movie is going to depend entirely on Episode IX.\\n\\nThere definitely are plot twists you don't see coming\\, but if you're an avid Star Wars fan they will leave you saying \\\"why?\\\" after you say \\\"wow!\\\"\\n\\nSome people don't like the humor\\, but at least when they introduced comic relief in this movie it worked\\, unlike the prequels (ala Jar Jar\\, for example).\\n\\nThere are two big failures of Last Jedi. The first is that Luke's past is completely uncharacteristic and the movie smothers his legend as previously written in the now-irrelevant Extended Universe. He has a singular moment to inspire awe\\, but it falls short of the \\\"Greatest Jedi to ever live\\\" and that is likely all we get out of his character.\\n\\nThe other massive failure is that this movie fails to turn Kylo into a credible rival for Rey. That's not to say Kylo isn't a convincing\\, although conflicted villain. And if you're just looking for someone that is willing to do evil for the sake of his goals\\, then you will be happy... But if you were hoping he would turn out to be a credible threat in a direct confrontation with the rookie Jedi\\, you will be disappointed. Even recovered\\, he is outclassed or evenly matched by her at every step. Kylo is summed up perfectly\\, early on: \\\"You're no Vader. You're just a child in a mask.\\\" And unless JJ steps up Kylo's game\\, that will be his legacy.","true":true}
