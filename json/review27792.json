Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Perhaps my least favorite star wars movie\\, even Episode 5 beats it. So many sudden plot twists that aren't executed well ex: Snoke's death\\, Leia using the force. That girl at the end stops Fin from saving everyone idiotically. Also\\, Rey still has 0 memorable character qualities.","true":true}
