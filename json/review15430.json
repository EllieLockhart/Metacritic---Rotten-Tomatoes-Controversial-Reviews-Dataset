Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it!! Can't understand why folks are hating on it other than the fact that those haters are peeved that the movie doesn't follow their preconceived story line! Ah\\, anyone remember how shocked you were when you learned Vader was Luke's father? Did that follow your preconceptions? Nope unless you started watching the movies from ESP 1! Get over yourselves!! The film was amazing period end of story! ","true":true}
