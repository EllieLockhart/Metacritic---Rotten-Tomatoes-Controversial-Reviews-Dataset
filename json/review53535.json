Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode VIII is a paradoxical\\, complex watch that starts with a bang\\, wows at every corner\\, and never lets up.\\n\\nWhat a uniquely overwhelming\\, utterly bombastic journey THE LAST JEDI is. Different\\, yet familiar - bleak\\, yet hilarious - Rian Johnson has pushed the series' duality forward in genuinely shocking ways whilst seamlessly merging this generation's story with the last. Episode VIII is a paradoxical\\, complex watch that starts with a bang\\, wows at every corner\\, and never lets up.\\n\\nIt's hard to put any sort of defining stamp on this entry in the series. It gives us so much. During the course of its two and a half hour runtime\\, TLJ delivers revelations of not only its characters present\\, but their rich pasts as well. And if that wasn't enough\\, the film (in fitting with its duality) leaves us with just as many questions for their futures. \\n\\nRey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Kylo\\, and of course Luke & Leia are each firing on all cylinders and we're thrown\\, as Maz would say\\, right back into the mess. In this respect\\, and many others\\, it truly is a ponderous middle-chapter that will have fans talking for years to come.\\n\\nAll in all\\, Rian Johnson's entrance into the galaxy far\\, far away feels very appropriate for 2017. The lines between good and bad\\, right and wrong\\, seem to be stretched to their limit in our own reality\\, and it is interesting to watch beloved characters face the same - just with a few more explosions. It is deeply reassuring\\, though\\, to know who your friends are at the end of this intense journey. The temptation is there\\, to leave everything in the grey. But do this\\, Johnson does not. And with that\\, a huge spark of hope is returned to the galaxy.","true":true}
