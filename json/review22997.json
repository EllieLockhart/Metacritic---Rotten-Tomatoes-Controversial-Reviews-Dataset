Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of homage to old characters and some good fight scenes. Bad story line\\, very choppy and new characters had no depth had no connection with them. Some scenes didn\u2019t even need to be in the movie. Should of had less film time of Leia and Luke more of the buildup of Kyle And Rey And Poe. ","true":true}
