Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why this movie gets such great reviews from critics...It wasn't that good. I am a huge Star Wars fan and always have been since I was very young and saw A New Hope for the first time. Star Wars has always had a sense of magical touch to it with the original trilogy but has now seem to have lost it in this new movie. The Force Awakens was alright. It wasn't bad but it lacked a good story and that it exactly what this movie lacks. This was the movie that killed the new trilogy in my opinion. It was very hard for me to follow with what is actually going on and why most of these characters are important. No Spoilers from me but this movie wasn't that good. I would say wait for it to come out on DVD because honestly its not that good. Don't waste your time with it.","true":true}
