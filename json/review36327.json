Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The major critics must have more money than sense and be stoned... the movie even if you take the star and the wars away is a poor film.   A maverick gilm maker has bedn givern free freign to do as he pleases.  This is a gamle at best that fails.\\n\\nUsing a film saga like this and making the direction change thats has been done does not make this a star wars movie.    I have no faith in any of the major critics and never did since they couk not even see the terrible plit and script.   Its only saving point is the debision that it had cause intrntional or not.","true":true}
