Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed - new characters are invincible whilst all others bite the dust or are simply cannon fodder (once maybe\\, but again and again??). Luke and Snoke endings are appalling. Story line awful. Disney really dropped the ball on this one. Grew up with Star Wars in the '70s and quite liked Force Awakens but this is the last one I'll bother going to watch. But....strangely\\, wife and kids quite liked it!","true":true}
