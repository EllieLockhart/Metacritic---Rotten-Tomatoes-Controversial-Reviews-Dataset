Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched this twice\\, just to make sure I wasn't dreaming.\\n\\nThis movie looks great but with forgettable story.\\nMany of the char in there are just completely \\nexpendable.\\n\\nI am really disappointed\\, not much to look forward in ep9","true":true}
