Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh my god\\, what did they do to Luke. Turned him into some grumpy old tit-milking weirdo.\\n\\nThe whole casino thing.  How can Disney a multi-billion dollar organisation spend half a film on lecturing the public on why making money is bad.\\n\\nThey even put a purple haired feminist in just to fill the diversity quota...talk about projecting your insecurities.\\n\\nPoor Finn\\, was the janitor of the Death Star now he's just looking for a plot arc and when he gets to finally get to do something and sacrifice himself for his fellow rebels...another diversity hire Rose stops him from having a big send off and mutters these immortal words \\\"that's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate\\, saving what we love.\\\" - that makes no sense and our cinema burst out laughing.\\n\\nSo many plot holes ..... who writes this crap.\\n\\nThe only reason I'll give it half a star was for some of the special effects which I thought were well done.","true":true}
