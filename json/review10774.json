Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down the best Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back. First SW to explore new grounds in narrative\\, plot and characters. A necessary risk to bring possibilities to a now larger universe. I recall when audiences WHINED\\, shocked to learn Vader was Luke's father\\, as usual those same audiences praise ESB now. If you don't like TFA don't complain and stick to Episodes I\\, II and III... those are all pre\\ndictable enough.","true":true}
