Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best in the saga? I'm on my way to thinking so. The plot was simple\\, but that is always the case with Star Wars movies - they are about the characters and relationships between them. \\n\\nLuke's characterization makes sense after 30 years and the dynamic between him and Rey reminds me of him and Yoda. \\n\\nAdam Driver stole every scene he was in and convinced me of how complex a villain Kylo Ren really is.","true":true}
