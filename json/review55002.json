Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't a bad movie. In terms of cinema\\, I would give it 8\/10. It had great special effects and CG was on point. The fight scenes were astonishing and really put me on the edge of my seat. However\\, this was a Star Wars movie in TITLE ONLY. Rian Johnson did a good job at making a beautiful movie but missed out on plot coherency throughout the series. Unless episode 9 fills in some of the plot holes\\, they might have ruined the series for the star wars fandom in a similar way that episodes 1 and 2 did. It did not live up to the genre of Space Opera like the originals in the first trilogy did and there was very little exploration into the Star Wars galaxy in the film. I am very upset with what this movie did. Rather than making a movie that would be consistent with the other movies in the series\\, and also bringing along new fans with the action and light humor scenes\\, they decided to give a giant middle finger to those who love the star wars universe. Its as if Disney and Rian Johnson were imprinting on Kylo Ren's character when they had him say \\\"let the old die\\, kill it if you have to.\\\" But killing off the characters wasn't the problem for most of us Star Wars fans\\, I mean people die\\, that is reality. The problem was how they died and the unrealistic protection they placed on the new characters in the series. I really gave this movie the benefit of the doubt all the way through\\, and it kept disappointing me. Not in who died\\, or who lived\\, but in the story itself. It was as if the writers said\\, lets just make everything unpredictable\\, then it will be good. And while I agree that a certain degree of unpredictability makes for a good story telling\\, just the mere fact that everything is unpredictable does not a good story make.","true":true}
