Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ Had some of the best scenes in the franchise and some of the worst. Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Daisy Ridley acting was phenomenal\\, but the plot did not deliver and made you wanting more for all of the wrong reasons.","true":true}
