Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not much to add to the many nagative reviews of TLJ. While I respect the directors vision and can see his theme\\, I don't believe it was as original as many think (R1 already starting exploring the \\\"grey\\\" areas). In the end\\, I thought TLJ was rather boring and ultimately not enjoyable.","true":true}
