Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone seems to hate the movie. I was a huge critic of the Force Awakens. This was for me a great movie! Sure a few flaws but overall great.\\nFlaws:\\n1) Phasma got her great scene but died right after. That is a great actor I wanted to see more of her.\\n2) when Finn goes to sacrifice himself either him or Rose should have died.\\n\\nGreat things:\\n1) Killed Snoke! Did not think they would actually do it I was stunned and I loved the power trip Kylo went on after\\n2) fixed Kylo. Sure he was still a wasn't perfect but he is far more intimidating now.\\n3) appropriately placed humor. So many movies have humor after something meaningful but this one places it in appropriate places.\\n4) weird Kylo Rey thing going on the hole movie I thought wow is that going to be a thing.\\n5) Rey's parents are not important. It's no big reveal their is no huge continuity error created she is no one.","true":true}
