Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reading some of these reviews it seems that all of the plot points I loved about the movie are disliked by the rest.  It's alright\\, people didn't like Empire when it was released either.","true":true}
