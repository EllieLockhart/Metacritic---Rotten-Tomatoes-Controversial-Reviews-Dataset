Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This new trilogy is clearly taking a new direction that will upset a lot of diehard fans (myself included). Disney is marketing Star Wars to a new generation which is understandable. I just wish they didn\u2019t have to rip off and discredit the original trilogy to do so. This is a disservice to diehard fans ","true":true}
