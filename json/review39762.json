{"101487":181723,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-24","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a low IQ\\, overly snarky\\, Star Wars.  At movie number 11 in the official canon this needs to build on the established dogma of the Jedi and Luke - after all it is called the Last Jedi and Luke is a main character in it\\, but this one has its own false ideas about what Jedi are and who Luke really is at the core.  With our Star Wars IQ having been raised with Revenge of the Sith\\, and The Clone Wars\\, and Rebels and the offficial intelligent canon novels like Tarken and Catalyst\\, we have had our expectations and our Star Wars IQ raised.  And after 30 years we finally get to find out what Luke did after ROTJ\\, while disregarding some pretty good expanded universe novels that cover this since they are not canon anymore after.  But instead of having something good to turn to we get this aberration of a Star Wars story told by someone who seems to have no real knowledge - or most likely probably doesn't care to - of Jedi and Luke and Leia and anything else with Star Wars on a real intelligent level.  And I can only assume that Disney does care about these things\\, not just making money\\, but the oversight and quality control was spread thin doing 3 movies at the same time\\, (Rogue One\\, Last Jedi\\, Han Solo movie) and since they spent a lot of time micromanaging RO and Han Solo\\, that they just left this one alone in the uncaring hands of Riam Johnson and the ironically enough he put out the worst Star Wars movie by far of any of them going back to 1977.  I am still in a state of shock over this and then to read quotes from Johnson himself saying\\, \\\"loosen up Star Wars should be fun.\\\"  I am speechless.  This movie is horrible and unfaithful to all things Star Wars and he says that.  Even Mark Hamill himself disowns this version of Luke!?  That is true.  I want to forget this movie even exists and I hope this movie fails enough that Disney does some real soul searching about episode 9 and how much they want to be known as the turning point when Star Wars turned bad after Lucas got out.  Listen to your fans Disney!   Listen to the people who know this world better than Rian Johnson!  This story is incongruent with all established things about Luke and the Jedi and all established things in this world.  But even if you take away Luke and that whole part of it.  This story is just bad!  The side characters\\, the way things unfold\\, the dialogue\\, the sci-fi physics\\, the plausability of how things happened in this.  It is an insult to me.  I feel like I want to insult Riam Johson and the main people who told this story and wrote this dialogue for insulting my intelligence.  A Star Wars movie where the established good guy is not really good anymore\\, just wants to die\\, and give up\\, is unfathomable.  Where dialogue sounds like Archie Bunker wrote it.  I have to think this is a Star Wars movie for those with a low IQ\\, overly snarky\\, and dauche bag ideas of right and wrong.  On the few plus sides\\, Adam Driver was great in his role and acting and so was Daisy Ridley.  The artistry of this film is extraordinary.  However Luke and his story is long awaited point of it.  And that is where it fails to a huge degree.  Also with the side stories and side characters.  There was just too much and too many.  The whole backstory of Luke and Ben and the new Jedi Order is a whole movie and series of stories onto itself but all we get is a few minutes of the unplausable idea that was presented.  Very very disappointed.  I will take my fantasy movies seriously is they take me seriously\\, such as Rogue One took me seriously.  This one does not.   Very Sincerely\\, Steve","true":true}
