Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If there is any movie that can make me look at a movie franchise differently\\, it is this movie.  It's full of twists\\, and has really awesome action scenes.  This movie is one of the best star wars\/movies of all time.","true":true}
