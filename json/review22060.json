Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson have teamed up to destroy childhoods and one of the all time great fictional universes. The choices made in the Last Jedi defy belief and will shatter the hopes of Star Wars fans across the galaxy.","true":true}
