Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Contrary to popular belief\\, Luke Skywalker is not space Jesus and actually has flaws. \\nI loved all of the movie. Kylo Ren has evolved from the angsty emo he was in the first film to an actual villain. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the subplot with Finn and Rose. I barely remember the casino scene other than BB-8. Between them leaving the Resistance ship and them getting onto the First Order ship\\, nothing noteworthy other than a casino getting destroyed happened. \\nOther than that and a few minor things I loved the movie and would love to learn more about the characters\\, including a lot of the minor and supporting ones.","true":true}
