Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson takes what J.J. Abrams built and says...meh...and does a U-turn on the middle of the 405. This is dangerous. Even though parts of it do work wonderfully. He seems to want to make a point about Star Wars folklore more than make a movie about Star Wars. It seems meta in that way. There are too many points where I feel like he is making a critique on Star Wars\\, when Kylo says\\, paraphrasing\\, \\\"It's time for it all to die. The Sith. The Jedi. All of it.\\\" The movie he had made up to that point felt like that was what he was about to do\\, murder the franchise. From the tossing of the lightsaber\\, to superwoman Leia\\, to the empty character of Finn. This was nothing like what The Force Awakens and Rogue One had been building upon. And\\, while he claims to have added a droid saying\\, \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\,\\\" he simply forgot. Either he forgot\\, or it's the dumbest decision ever made in a Star Wars movie since Lucas created Jar Jar Binks. Thus\\, I'd rather believe that Rian Johnson just didn't care enough about Star Wars and forgot. He just didn't care about Star Wars.","true":true}
