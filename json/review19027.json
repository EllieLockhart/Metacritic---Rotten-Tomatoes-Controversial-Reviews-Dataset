Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It seems that most people who are rating this movie high are okay with the fact that this was\\, in reality\\, not a Star Wars movie\\, and challenged the status quo. I am okay with this happening\\, but without providing spoilers\\, the changes were disrespectful and offensive to the franchise.\\n\\n1. Rian Johnson either did not watch Episode 7 or saw it and then decided to flip off the watcher. He knows which questions and concerns people have been discussing for two years\\, and he pretty much destroyed every answer and mystery we were looking forward to.\\n\\n2. Don't publicly make comments that are lies about characters. You can't say someone is more powerful than past characters and not follow through. You can't  say a character has more screen time and not follow through. \\n\\n3. A good portion of the plot and conflict were useless.
