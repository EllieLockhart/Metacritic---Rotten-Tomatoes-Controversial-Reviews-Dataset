Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter nonsense. A failure to create a cohesive storyline\\, answer any questions\\, or create new characters we actually care about. This film fails on every level except the visuals.","true":true}
