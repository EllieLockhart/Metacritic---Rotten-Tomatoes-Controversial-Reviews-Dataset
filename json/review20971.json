Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hoping for another version of this episode\\, for me this movie is such a mess that I don't know if this is not another frankenmovie\\, is hard to wrap my mind on why they try so hard to end the Skywalker saga to move on\\, I get it\\, there's much more to explore and all that\\, but it needs to be a decent and respectful end\\, no like this.\\nBeyond the Skywalker point\\, the movie force humorous moments trying really hard to be funny at times where probably it doesn't fit\\, bad timing is one of the main issues with this movie\\, it is just a Jar Jar Binks short to be a galactic disaster.","true":true}
