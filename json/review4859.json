Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Congrats Disney! You had to kill the past to make way for the future. You dishonor the former characters and leave the next generations characters (Poe\\, finn\\, RAY) no one to learn from. \\n\\nHad the movie been what was implied in the trailer\\, then this would have been amazing. \\n\\nThese movies aren't made for the old generation\\, we are living in a post Guardians of the Galaxy world now. Everything's is humorous and never serious\\, because serious scares off the Disney family target audience. \\n\\nBe prepared to be disappointed folks\\, there's more to come. And \\\"it\\\" as it were\\, is over.","true":true}
