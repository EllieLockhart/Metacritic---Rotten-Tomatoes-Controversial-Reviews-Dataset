Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals were beautiful\\, but the story was hollow and the humor was cringy. \\nCaptain Phasma\\, was on screen for 5 minutes. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring and accomplished nothing. Snoke's character didn't develop properly and we still don't know who he was\/is ( According to some theories he is alive)","true":true}
