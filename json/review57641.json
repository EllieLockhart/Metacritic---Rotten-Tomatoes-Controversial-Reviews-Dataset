Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much was crammed into it. Not enough time was spent on significance of Luke's transcendence. It could have been so much more poetic but was odd in that at one point we all thought he was looking at some far off space craft in the sunlight. \\n\\nToo many characters. Not enough time spent developing main characters. Too many laughable scenes that make NO SENSE. I like that they tried to make Leia a stronger character but it just wound up being weird. Too many scenes intended to be humorous fell flat. Not enough info from either films and both tend to lean far to heavily on the originals. The Force Awakens felt like a re-run of the first Star Wars film. There were a couple of great things in the film with Leia's second in command\\, Luke and one humorous moment between him and Ray. \\n\\nOverall I'm super disappointed because some ideas were full of so much win but were either overshadowed by stuffing the film or because of poor execution and presentation. The original films were more straightforward\\, not all over the place\\, and didn't try to tell 100 different stories within a single film. \\n\\nI had a very open mind going into the film and loved Mark Hamill's performance and it was great to see Carrie Fisher on screen one last time.","true":true}
