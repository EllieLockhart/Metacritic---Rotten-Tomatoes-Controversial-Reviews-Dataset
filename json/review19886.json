Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was certainly not what I expected. I ended up loving everything Poe and Leia\\, but really not being particularly excited about Luke\\, Rey and Kylo's storyline. Furthermore\\, I hated Finn\\, who was completely useless in this movie. To me\\, the breakout characters were Poe\\, Rose and Holdo\\, but the main characters of the trilogy (Rey\\, Kylo and Finn) continue to be disappointingly bidimensional. All the character development they had on TFA seemed to have taken a break in this film. Unfortunately\\, Leia's screentime was way too short\\, but she stealed every scene she was in. And I literally screamed when Yoda appeared on screen. Ultimately\\, this movie is a total failure in terms of screenplay\\, but a mild success visually.","true":true}
