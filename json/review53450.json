Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney ruins what star wars is truly about\\, by creatively and beautifully taking out the skywalker family from the franchise. I admire the way they did it\\, but by making star wars something they can make money out of for years and years to come\\, they destroyed what star wars was truly about. a Family\\, not jedi's or sith wich as cool as they are\\, were not the core deep meaning to the story. also killing luke skywalker without us ever getting to really see him fight\\, for those of us who do love the action\\, was a big let down. Sure he did a cool trick\\, but that pales in comparison to what i was so happy i thought was gonna happen\\, him useing the force to crush all those walkers and truly become part of the franchise again.  Also as smart as i try to make mysef feel about reys parants\\, deep down i cant help but feel disappointed. Visuals were top notch\\, and the music was amazing. but in my gut i feel that disney made a move to make money forever with this story\\, and gut the soul and heart from this classic story. also starting the movie right where we left off from awakens was a horrible move. not letting our imaginations fill in the blanks with wonder and give this a true saga feeling\\, its just a part 2 of the first movie in the trilogy. i just feel like it leaves some of the wonder out of the magic. i will be truly upset if we dont get to see ghost luke fight in the next movie.","true":true}
