Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great action and plot line. Failed to tie the force awakens in to explain how certain things were possible. A thing should be believable within its own universe which based off what we learn in the last jedi\\, the force awakens was not. Also huge failed opportunity with Snoke. you have the most powerful force sensitive being weve ever seen\\, and before we understand who or why he is what so ever\\, he is killed by a whine bag who recently lost a fight to someone who 48hrs sooner didnt know what the force was. other than that. very enjoyable if you take it at superficial value and just roll with whatever unbelievable stuff they decide wants to happen","true":true}
