Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined Luke Skywalker. Luke was the one who had hope he was the \\\"new hope.\\\" He didn't give up to turn Darth Vader\\, his father\\, to the light side and at the end\\, he did. But\\, he totally gives up on Ben and her just goes to the dark side. Bad mistake.","true":true}
