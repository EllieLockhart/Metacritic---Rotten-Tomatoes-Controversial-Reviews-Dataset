Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics score of 8.1\/10 is way too high for this film. It had several fun and exciting moments\\, but these were overshadowed by plot holes and cheesy dialogue that made a lot of Star Wars like me cringe. This kind of carelessness might be forgivable in a stand-alone sci-fi action movie\\, but not in a Star Wars sequel. It's a real shame because the new characters\\, especially Rey and Kylo\\, had a lot of potential. I really hope they can get Star Wars back on track after this sloppily written mess\\, but it may be too late.","true":true}
