Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what's up with all the hate. Yes Star Wars is great\\, but you pretend the original trilogy is perfect\\, you're clearly setting yourself up for failure\\, and not very versed in cinematic storytelling\\, especially if you're comparing TLJ unfavorably. Was this the best Star Wars movie\\, no\\, but I like it better than TFA already. I enjoyed this\\, will probably see it again\\, and will buy it\\, because I love the franchise. Though overall I was expecting more from the Disney Star Wars films (yes TFA as well)\\, they were NEVER gonna be what we hyped in our minds. I havw more issues with the franchise as a whole than I do with this movie. I really enjoyed it and thought it had a way better pace and flow than TFA.","true":true}
