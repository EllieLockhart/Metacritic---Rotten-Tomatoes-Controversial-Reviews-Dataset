Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson single handidily ruined star wars for me. He obviously contradicted almost everything from the force awakens for \\\"writing freedom.\\\" His blatent disrespect for previous movies and changing cannon again for \\\"writing freedom\\\" is digusting. He threw out a 30 year legacy for his own selfish reasons. Rey and kylo ren are mediocore characters and the story never gets too deep\\, besides when hes killing off old characters so he'll be able to write his own in new movies. I hope Lucas films and Disney never work with Rian Johnson again and its gonna be hard to erase the stain that he left on star war and i hope he feels bad about it....","true":true}
