Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay very depressing ending....two major characters killed luke and snooke. But are they really dead. Hopefully they bring them back. I mean anything is possible. But that would be the greatest twist ever if luke is back in the next one. I'll wait for spoilers next time before going to episode 9 because if Luke isn't back or if Rey parents are not better revealed. Then I might not bother with the next one. I usually hate spoilers\\, but I'm not wasting my money if they're not planning the stories very well.","true":true}
