Instead of continuing the story it goes into a new story which I did not find as interesting but still it was decent I liked the sex scene hehe boobies. However as I said\\, it didn't feel like a Last of Us 2 since the story's weren't really well intertwined. I think this would've been fine if it was like a non canon version of the Last of Us like Star Wars 7-9\\, because AS a sequal its a 0 but as a spin off I'd probably give it a 7\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
