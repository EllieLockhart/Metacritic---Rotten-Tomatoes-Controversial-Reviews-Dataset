Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank you to Rian Johnson from a longtime 47-year-old Star Wars fan.     I am --very-- satisfied by this film.    \\\"Blown away\\\" is more correctly stated.     Superb story\\, superb acting\\, superb effects.   Well done !!","true":true}
