Abby's campaign starts only after you finish Ellie's campaign\\, this means that after every bad thing you've seen her do\\, the game suddenly tries to persuade you Abby isn't such a bad person.\rEverything would make a lot more sense if the player got to play the other character after each mission\\, to know the perspective and storyline of both playable characters.\r\rPlaying Abby's campaign feels like a 6 hour chore to get both storylines connected.\rNo matter what she goes through\\, any kind of risk she takes\\, there won't be a single second when you worry if anything happens to her because the end of Ellie's campaign already tells you that Abby shows up in theater.\r\r2. The ending makes absolutely no sense\\, Ellie travels so far to avenge the one person who mattered the most to her\\, the flashbacks keep reminding her of what Abby did to Joel\\, but in the end she shows her mercy\\, despite Abby never showing none to her.\rYou add so much shock value to the Narrative and focus all the emotions and character development around Ellie's anger\\, grief and seeking vengeance\\, only for her to throw everything away?\r\rThe entire game leaves me wondering\\, what was the point of the entire journey?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
