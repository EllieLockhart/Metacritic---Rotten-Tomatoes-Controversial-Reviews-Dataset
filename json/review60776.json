I played on the hardest difficulty where enemies were intelligent and powerful. The stealth encounters took place in large areas and were fun and challenging. There are a ton of combat animations that make use of the area during finishers (ex walls and floors). The new system improves on the weighted feel that combat had in the original and is very satisfying. The graphics are pretty good there is a lot of detail. My ps4 pro sounds like it is launching into orbit when running this game.The story is pure garbage. New characters introduced for no reason. The second half of this game was a pointless side quest that I did not care about. Without spoiling the ending ill just say that it was laughably bad and unsatisfying.This is without a doubt the most disappointing video game I have ever played. The bait and switch used to market this game is disgusting.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
