We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I was questionable about the game\\, given Part 2 is twice as long as Part 1. But looking back\\, I can't deny playing this was a great experience. The gameplay is significantly improved and the world immersion is enhanced. Areas are bigger - there's much more to discover and many more (and more types!) of infected and human factions to go all our guerilla warfare on. I'm excited to get going on my second playthrough (skipping the cinematics this time around).\r\rThis game is a lot to digest. Having said that\\, there's no denying that\\, as a horror survival game\\, this is 10\/10. Part 2 brought a good balance of Part 1's silliness to its brutality. At times I was chuckling and feeling the warm fuzzies; other times\\, I was cringing saying out loud \\\"no\\, no\\, no...I don't want to do this. Why are you making me do this!?\\\" All the way throughout\\, you're tip-toeing around corners praying to God a clicker doesn't jump out of the wall or that a sniper doesn't spot you from a distance. Never have I been so triggered by the sound of a whistle.\r\rSome reviewers seem hung up on the storyline and are forgetting that beggars can't be choosers. At the end of the day\\, did you really think Joel selfishly sabotaging a world-saving vaccine would go unpunished? How else did you think a sequel would play out? We got so much more than we asked for. Sure\\, I'm not super happy about the ending...I like closure...and I wish Ellie could still play the guitar with all five fingers on her left hand...but at the end of the day\\, I can't deny I enjoyed this and would play it again and again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
