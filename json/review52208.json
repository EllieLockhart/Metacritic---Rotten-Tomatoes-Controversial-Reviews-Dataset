Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"after watching this I'm done with star wars..I'm not watching the upcoming Han Solo movie. I'm not going to watch the crap trilogy that rian Johnson has in mind in the future. this movie was horrible. the script was horribly written. the characters were poorly written and what they did to Luke was absolutely wrong and unbecoming of what Luke Skywalker was actually about. did rian Johnson even watch any previous star wars movies. as far as star wars is concerned return of the Jedi is the last star wars movie. I'm not including force awakens our the last Jedi or any other disgusting crap that Disney comes out with. they should be ashamed of themselves","true":true}
