Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So I've never left a Star Wars movie saying to myself\\, \\\"IDK how I feel about that\\\" and the more I think about it Im really starting not to like it. It seems like they are trying to turn Star Wars into the Avengers. The scene with Leia in the beginning really pissed me off. Obviously the throne room scene was the best part of the movie and badass. Im the type of person who likes majority of what I watch\\, but I have to agree with Mark Hamill when he said I don't agree with the direction Disney has taken his character. Every StarWars movie has made me excited to see the next one this one did not do that\\, hopefully JJ Abrams can save this new trilogy with the final installment.","true":true}
