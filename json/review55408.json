Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Make sure you leve one star or RT will not count your review...I made an account just to leave a review on how bad this was\\, As a point I have to say Im a fan of the books so im a little biased because I know what a relatively good continuation looked like BUT when they nixed cannon I still had hopes but my god\\, they must just throw darts at sticky notes to put these movies together now. Its super cringy how they blatantly add little \\\"cute\\\" easily marketable creatures\\, That completely blew up in Lucas's face with Jar Jar\\, how stupid do you have to be to try and do that again. The political undertones of the movie are annoying for anyone above skill level one comprehension\\, just tell a goddamn space war story\\, the marketing towards kids excuse is hilarious\\, as if just shredding a 35 plus year story wouldnt warrant backlash (math pro tip\\, there are more \\\"older\\\" fans then \\\"young fans\\\"). This shit was a slap in the face which is whatever\\, its Disneys movie now but they cant sit around and wonder why everyone hates it when they put out a shit product. Also fuck Disney for clearly creating fake accounts to leave reviews and cutting some obvious deal with \\\"pro critics\\\" (which they got busted for with TFA if I remember correctly","true":true}
