Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked The Force Awakened well enough it set up some interesting speculation in the fan community and hey its new and fresh. This movie was a train wreck\\, horribly written new characters\\, contrived plot that boils down to a slow speed space chase with SOOO many issues with how events could possibly occur at the same time and still pan out proper. The character assassination of Luke Skywalker because we need to prop up Rey as this unassailable hero who doesn't even need training to beat multiple trained assassins and a evil force sorcerer. An entire set piece on a casino world to shove political ideology in the face of the viewer. Completely absurd examples of Leia's force power allowing her to survive the vacuum of space. Finally a capital ship using lightspeed to ram a fleet which in the Star Wars CANON that was not thrown out with the EU is IMPOSSIBLE becasue of how light speed works.","true":true}
