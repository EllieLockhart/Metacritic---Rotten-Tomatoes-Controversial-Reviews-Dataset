Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. i find it so funny that people criticize this movie for shattering all preconceived ideas about how star wars should be. that is exactly what makes this movie so great!!! it dares to be different\\, and take a totally different path than what we're used to. this is the exact reason why i didn't enjoy the force awakens too much. i love movies that want to be unique and different in their own way\\, and i love that they did that with star wars. (a half-star off though for those casino scenes haha)\\n\\ndon't hate on this movie because it's not what you envisioned star wars to be. behind all that is great character development\\, creative twists\\, and the most refreshing star wars episode in a very\\, very long time","true":true}
