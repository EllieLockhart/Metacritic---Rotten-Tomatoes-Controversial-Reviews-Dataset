Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seemed like a commercial for the toys... There is no vision in this film and it really just feels like a standard run-of-the-mill franchise film which I really did not want Star Wars to become. \\n\\nI feel really bad for the actors after having such a great showing in  the first one and then having to act in the horrendous script for the seconds... its like they changed writers at the very last minute... All the really great shots in the film are also not visionary at all and its just the product of good investment (ie. proper film crew\\, proper cameras\\, proper lighting) rather than directorial vision. \\n\\nThis movie might as well have to be remade for Abrams to save the trilogy or else I fear that Star Wars may be no more in the future.","true":true}
