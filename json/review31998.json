{"101487":169440,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers in this comment. Here's how ridiculously stupid The Last Jedi is. Its so stupid\\, that there isn't a single destroyer in the First Order fleet that can match the Resistance cruisers' speed. Its stupid that the resistance used \\\"Bombers\\\" to bomb the dreadnought .You know\\, I've seen something called a torpedo - its like a bomb that can be deployed from a distance!!!! When they said bombers were coming in\\, I figured they'd be sending Y-Wings. Why does a resistance fleet even have bombers? Isn't it more like the tyrannical 1st Order to employ that type of craft? It was ridiculous that the only bomber to drop its payload was flying with no pilot and no gunner\\, yet it miraculously made it to the target destination. I guess the TIE fighters that destroyed all the other bombers so efficiently forgot to attack the last one\\, cuz well\\, the good guys are the good guys\\, and they have to win. I felt no tension in this entire scene\\, because I knew as soon as I saw the vulnerability of the bombers that all would be destroyed\\, but one would get to drop its payload before heroically blowing up. This movie adheres to every clich\u00e9 in the book. Chewbacca almost eats a funny bird\\, then turns vegetarian\\, Fin and gang almost pick up a really cool code breaker\\, but instead accidentally pick up a bouffant who studders. Snoke shows up personally. The self proclaimed ruler of the galaxy shows up in person. Idiotic writing. I guess snoke takes a more hands on approach? Princess Leah wakes up and stuns Poe (!!!Thank God!!!...and I liked Poe in the last movie)\\, Kylo and Ray start calling each other and the Emperor electrocutes Luke and then Darth Vader saves him... I mean... Snoke almost quotes the Bible\\, then gets killed by the guy who's the main bad guy\\, but secretly good\\, but still bad\\, but will turn good before the end. Yoda pretends to burn the Jedi holy books\\, to teach Luke a very valuable lesson - That failure is the greatest teacher... What? Failure is the greatest teacher???? We're enlightened now\\, people. You've probably never heard that one before. Moving on\\, The scene with the speeders vs. AT-M6's (AT-AT's) was ludicrous. The walkers should have probably just shot their lasers at the speeders and killed them\\, but we had to have this scene I guess. Then Fin gets a chance at glory. I was about to care about this movie for a second\\, then he gets wrecked into at 70 MPH by Rose's speeder and somehow they both survive. I guess ramming at high speeds really is an option. Then the young padawan\\, Ray ends up being better at moving rocks than Luke\\, the Millennium Falcon flies through the Death Star\\, I mean the plant's tunnel\\, and then the Resistance has a get together on board\\, even though almost everyone died\\, and they clearly didn't achieve any kind of tactical victory\\, unlike the end of A New Hope\\, where the sacrifice is great\\, but the Death Star is destroyed. Goodness - every moment of this film was predictable. And here's what I'm still hung up on... None of their star destroyers are fast enough to catch the rebel cruiser... lol!","true":true}
