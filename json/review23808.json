Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke was good. \\nRey was undermined.\\nAdam Driver's performance was as soulless as ever.\\nJohn Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran gave excellent performances.\\nA lot of unnecessary plot action occurs\\, mostly involving Poe.\\nThe main characters speak to each other mostly from across the divide\\, which\\, as a filmmaking technique is a very jarring and uncomfortable experience for the viewer.","true":true}
