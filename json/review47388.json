Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What could have been a great transition movie is just an awful destruction of everything that was set in episode 7.\\nThis shows that Disney and Lucasfilms had no global direction for the story and the characters from the beginning and will continue to deliver incoherent and inconsistent mess in the years to come.  \\nEven when non considering that this is a Star Wars this movie is just bad\\, badly written and badly executed\\, how can one can an incoherent scene like Leia's space poppins scene\\, shoot it\\, edit it and think it's believable and the audience will accept that?\\nThis is pretty much the general tone of the film where the viewer has to swallow by force ineptitudes \\, twists that are lame or disrespectful (Luke's new personality is beyond comprehension as Snoke's death)\\, incoherent slow space chase speeds or useless sub plots that are going absolutely nowhere. \\nRian Johnson has very good aesthetic skills that's sure but has absolutely no capacity to create a compelling story that makes sens and form a whole (sorry falks but Looper is a non sensical movie that is also bad)\\, instead we have a lot of things throwed at us like crumbs to a bird and all those directions leads to an absolute void.\\n\\nAlso certain of those political messages are very misplaced and ruin even more the experience.\\n\\nBad Rian\\, bad Disney you won't have my money for episode 9.","true":true}
