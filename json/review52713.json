Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All these negative user reviews are all saying basically the same thing\\, \\\"It was different and I don't like change!! \\\"  I believe the argument from the last movie was that it was just a retread of Star Wars:A New Hope.  Now they are complaining because it subverted their expectations.  And all the negative viewer ratings are 1\/2 stars.  It seems suspicious that all the negative reviews are so similar in rating and messaging. \\n\\nMy family and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It was a great ensemble movie. Can't wait for the next one!","true":true}
