Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS     SPOILERS     SPOILERS\\n OMG! BRILLIANT! Best star wars by far! Give Mark Hamil and Adam Driver some oscar nominations. It was gripping\\, funny\\, full of twists! Seen it three times and it just gets better. SPOILERS AHEAD: finnamd rose plotline was less interesting the second time around but I love that Star Wars has some social commentary. \\nBest part of the whole movie was the showdown.\u00a0 Luke went out like a champ. It was epic!\u00a0 The showdown was perfect! He showed kylo how powerful he really was\\, humiliated him\\, and did it as true representation of what a jedi should be.\u00a0 It was better than I imagined and it even reminded me of the sarlaac pit scene because of the tension and Lukes confidence.\u00a0 Plus his whole han solo line! One last F U to Kylo Ren.\u00a0 Beautiful.\u00a0 He comes full circle\\, finds inner peace and becomes one with the force. I still get goosebumps thinking about it.","true":true}
