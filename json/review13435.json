Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie.  It was great to see The Force regain the mysticism of the original trilogy.  The interaction between Rey and Luke was absolutely fantastic.  Sassy Luke was amazing imho and I loved see the conflict within him about training another padawan. Also seeing the perspective of what happened that fateful night from both his and Ren's perspective was very interesting.  Carrie Fisher's final performance was wonderful and I'm saddened that she couldn't finish the trilogy.  The only things that fell flat for me was Finn and Rose's side quest.  It brought absolutely nothing to the movie and just filled time.  The other thing was Phasma.  At this point any mystique she may have had is gone and they may as well just let her be dead.","true":true}
