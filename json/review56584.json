Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a soild and exciting\\, yet ultimately conflicted chapter in the Star Wars mythos. While it offers new and longtime fans truly exhilarating moments and fresh takes on the Star Wars story\\, it occasionally fails in delivering the distinct \\\"Star Wars\\\" experience for several reasons.\\n\\nFirst (though not necessarily foremost)\\, Rian Johnson failed to capture the distinct cinematographic of the trilogies that came before -- a feat that J. J. Abrams actually pulled off beautifully. This\\, coupled with the all-too-common quippy humor that has seemingly become commonplace in ANY genre of film (thanks to the success of Marvel's films) take away from the experience of watching a Star Wars film. Luke brushing his shoulder off during an otherwise astounding feat of the Force\\, Poe waiting \\\"on hold\\\" for Hux during a daring solo run on an Imperial Star Destroyer\\, etc -- These moments are huge and exciting\\, but are cut short by this quippy style of humor that has never quite been favored in the Star Wars saga (save a few lines from The Force Awakens; which were questionably odd themselves.)\\n\\nHowever\\, despite the jarring difference in cinematographic style (Hello\\, close ups of EVERYONE'S faces every 10 minutes) and the humor\\, the plot remains solid\\, the characters are truly compelling\\, and memorable scenes do well enough to make The Last Jedi another iconic chapter in the Star Wars saga\\, despite some failures. Luke's actions\\, despite being sometimes questionable\\, remain largely within character (not the quips. those were not within character).\\n\\nThe sets\\, new vehicles\\, scenes\\, characters\\, and more are all beautiful and well crafted (besides the Casino scene\\, which was an odd\\, uninspired placement of too-similar-to-real-life costumes and spectacles. I'm looking at you\\, weird little drunk creature).","true":true}
