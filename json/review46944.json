Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We've come to an age where it's apparently unthinkable to have logical\\, grounded fantasy. This \\\"film\\\" is an insult to everything that's come before it\\, completely disregarding the rules that have been in place for seven movies and force-feeding us a mess of cardboard characters\\, terrible plot progression\\, and humor & unexpected plot twists trumping effective storytelling.","true":true}
