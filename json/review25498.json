Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(NO SPOILERS) Are the rotten tomatoes critics paid by Disney? This film had its moments\\, unfortunately almost all of them were really bad\\, after watching episode 7 (a newer hope) which surprisingly got a high rating too\\, i was really hoping this wouldnt be the first order strikes back\\, and i guess it having a different storyline was the only redemption (and ofcourse seeing Luke) but otherwise a lot of this movie was unnecessary and at times is aggrevating\\, I firmly believe now that the prequels were in fact better than this mess\\, they felt like star wars.  My biggest annoyances are\\n1) Adam Driver is not menacing and never will be\\n2) Snoke wth?? why do they even have him?\\n3) Luke is a Jedi Master (I dont want to give away why Im writing this)\\n4) The saber fights suck\\n5) The characters are forgettable\\n\\nPlease learn something from Rogue One and try to make 9 good and stay away from J J Abrams","true":true}
