Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This being the 8th Star Wars movie it had a tightrope to walk\\, all kinds of crazy twists and turns have already been done by previous movies in the franchise so it couldn't repeat them. Still\\, I have been reading great reviews from both fans and critics\\, so I went in with a high expectation and it still was able to surprise and satisfy me. The story has enough twist n turns as well as fan service to make you laugh out loud in awe. Filled with meaningful character development\\, nice action sequences\\, sparkles of humor and a story well written\\, the movie is able to balance the Star wars legacy while moving forward with a new chapter. This was Mark Hamill movies\\, he gives the best performance of his career.","true":true}
