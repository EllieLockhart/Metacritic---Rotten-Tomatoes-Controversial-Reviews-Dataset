Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, this was the best starwars\\, fans are mad that they are evolving the story into like rouge versions of the Jedi\\, but I\u2019m glad the old ways are dead. Plus this creates ways to include more of the original starwars spin offs that people love so stop complaining","true":true}
