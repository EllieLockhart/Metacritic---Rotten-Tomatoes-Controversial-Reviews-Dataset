{"101487":134462,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-09","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I know there are many die-hard Star Wars fans who absolutely abhor everything about this movie\\, and while it does have its obvious shortcomings\\, I have to say it's quite enjoyable. From the onset\\, you're watching what's left of the Resistance in an absolutely hopeless situation\\, facing almost certain death and defeat\\, with their only hope for survival being left in the hands of a long shot plan at best. Rey begins to learn what her destiny is\\, as well as where or more accurate \\\"who\\\" she came from. Mark Hamill delivers probably his best on screen performance as Luke Skywalker\\, with a touch of darkness and cynicism that adds so much gravity and context to his character in the universe. His redemption as a hero at the end is one of the best moments in Star Wars\\, and his departure is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history. \\n\\nWhile I tend to agree with Hamill's statement that \\\"this isn't HIS Luke\\\"\\, as it isn't quite the way I would have written him (I more or less would have made this trilogy a true sequel to the originals\\, showing Luke at the forefront and as the central character still)\\, but I have to admit Rian Johnson did a great job executing his interpretation of the character\\, and even though I don't necessarily agree with it\\, I certainly appreciated it all the same\\, and it was well done.  \\n\\nAdam Driver's Kylo Ren also came a long way from The Force Awakens\\, as he delivers a very powerful performance\\, and becomes the full-force dark side villain\\, and accomplishes what Vader never could. \\n\\nLuke\\, Rey\\, and Kylo's arcs are enough to warrant a 4-star review from me\\, but the reason this doesn't get 5 are the obvious annoyances in this movie that should have never made the final cut (or the original script for that matter). \\n\\nFinn and Rose seem to have the most useless story that I've ever seen in cinema. They could have been left out of the film completely\\, and it wouldn't have affected the outcome in the slightest. The casino scenes were more than silly\\, and to me it looked as though they were only in the movie as a shameless plug for Disney's social justice agenda. We get it\\, slavery and animal cruelty are bad. Second\\, why did they just tell Poe what they were planning on doing from the get go? That could have potentially not gotten half of them killed\\, and made Holdo not have to stay with the ship. And third\\, and certainly most important\\, the forced juvenile humor that's sprinkled throughout the entire film. From the opening dialogue between Poe and Hux that's cringeworthy enough for someone without a lot of patience to simply walk out of the theater\\, and the awkward conversations between Finn and Rose made no sense whatsoever. \\n\\nSo in conclusion\\, I think The Last Jedi is a film worthy enough to bear the Star Wars name\\, and criticism aside\\, I think it was a very solid film that has more than enough positives to it to make up for its shortcomings. My only concern is that this next film will have a lot of hype surrounding it\\, and without any of our original \\\"big three\\\" to carry the franchise any longer\\, we will see how Ridley and Driver manage to prove their legitimacy to audiences in IX.","true":true}
