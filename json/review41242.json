Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a blight on the star wars universe.  If you can destroy a massive ship easily by going into light speed through it then that makes a death star an impossible option.  Why didn't' a rebel do that in the first movie?  You could have them all on autopilot too.  This abomination of a movie should be struck from the star wars canon.  How stupid was the interaction between Poe and Admiral Holdo?  Any army with such pathetic communication channels deserves to lose. Her plan was f**king stupid anyway. Now I hope that Kylo Ren wipes out the whole sorry lot of them in the last movie.  It would be the only reason to see it.  The Critic ratings illustrate just how useless and out of touch they are but the Audience score indicates a conspiracy by Rotten Tomatoes which devalues the whole brand.  As a contrast I rated the Force Awakens a 9 which made this movie even more disappointing.","true":true}
