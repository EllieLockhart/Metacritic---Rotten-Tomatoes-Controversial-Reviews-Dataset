Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's Star Wars\\, I would like more Star Wars to be made...just not written by these folks.  They messed with the story\\, the characters\\, the magic system (the religion too)\\, for the sake of different.  I don't know how you move forward from this.  It is not worthy of the +90 critic review.","true":true}
