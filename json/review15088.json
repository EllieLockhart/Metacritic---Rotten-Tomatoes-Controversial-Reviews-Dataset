Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theatre feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. The amount of humor attempts in this movie completely undermined the drama and were unnecessary and over the top (I cringed at the \\\"shoulder brush\\\"). The amount of close-ups made it not seem like a Star Wars movie\\, and the pacing seemed wrong. The subplots and the character of Rose were uninteresting. \\nThat being said\\, the Throne Room scene was my favorite in the entire saga. If the movie had focused more on Kylo\\, Rey\\, Luke\\, and the Force\\, it would have been much better.","true":true}
