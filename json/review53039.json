{"101487":105428,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan I was excited to see the movie and see epic lightsaber battles and adventure\\, but I was sorely mistaken and heartbroken when I saw it. I hated the entire movie except when Yoda appeared for about 2 minutes. I hated all the characters and my favorite character Luke was ruined. He was the most optimistic and courageous character but making him into a bitter old USELESS character stabbed me in the heart. It truly hurts me to write a bad review on my favorite franchise but I could find no redeeming qualities to it. These are not looking through rose colored glasses either\\, I usually can find examples from all the Star Wars films that had GREAT parts and redeeming features. What they need to do is hand over the reins to Dave Filoni or at least take MAJOR notes from him\\, because Star Wars Rebels was far superior to this crap. The Social Justice and Politics in real life DO NOT need to be in Star Wars\\, these movies are to escape to a Galaxy far far away and take us on an adventure!  Rose Tico makes Jar Jar BInks look like a great character! The Last Jedi should get thrown into the Abyss and never seen again\\, the novelization was alright but still I would tell everyone to skip this movie\\, I saw it twice and I still could not see anything redeeming. I MIGHT watch it again and own it to complete my collection but I would tell everyone to skip this movie.","true":true}
