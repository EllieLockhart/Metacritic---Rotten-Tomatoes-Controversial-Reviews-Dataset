Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke is no longer a mature jedi knight as seen  in episode VI\\, he is now a crazy bitter old man that really likes green milk\\, yoda doesn\u00b4t care for the yedi way after hundreds of years of being a pillar\\, Rey is the most powerful force \\\"user\\\" just because. Snoke is nobody\\, Rey is nobody and most jokes suck.","true":true}
