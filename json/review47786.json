Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where can I start with this film? It's bad...... like really really bad. I actually like bad films because they make me laugh or they interest me\\, am i only one like this? Probably. Anyway the force awakens was actually a really good film. it set up for a really good story but episode 8 just seems to take the set up and throw it all away. when i was a kid i could watch star wars and my eyes would be stuck to the screen\\, when watching episode 8 i was bored\\, i couldn't stop looking at my watch trying to work out how much longer it was going to be before i could go home. hell\\, in the cinema there was a kid next to me who was bored\\, i have never heard of a kid being bored during a star wars film before. anyway..... i'm not a critic\\, im just a fan and rian johnson has actually made me hate a star wars film. damn you disney\\, i hate you.","true":true}
