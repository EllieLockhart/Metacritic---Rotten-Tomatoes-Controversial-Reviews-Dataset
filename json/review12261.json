Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a Star Wars fan\\, per se. Most people liked Rogue One\\, which I thought was a waste of time\\, and I liked The Phantom Menace\\, which I understand\\, most fans do not. \\n\\nBut\\, I rather enjoy smaller worlds\\, more focused plot points like the slow speed chase of this film and the political dispute of Phantom Menace. These two films will enter the Top 5 Star Wars films in my eyes for their easy story telling. \\n\\nGranted\\, with that said\\, Finn and Rose's storyline was completely unnecessary in this film. They need to either do better by these characters or write them off completely. And what was the point of the Yoda scene? \\n\\nThis film made me like the new Star Wars. It made me like Adam Driver\\, and showed me what Lukas was attempting to do with Christensen in the first episodes... I get it now. \\n\\nR.I.P. Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
