Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new Star Wars franchise has an identity crisis.   They cannot figure out where they want the story to go.  What tone they should have for their films.  All the while the audience suffers through the blatant obvious addiction to indecision.  \\n\\nTLJ is an abomination to Star Wars.  The numerous plot holes. THe lack of backstory and character development.  This movie basically took all star wars lore and flushed it down the toilette. Flying superwoman Princess Leia.  This movie was a complete joke.   I am all for setting up the movies for a \\\"new\\\" generation but I find it offensive that Disney thought that Star Wars needed a reigniting.  The Star Wars movies are generationless.  They are of the few movies that isn't bound by time or culture but have persevered through it all.  \\n\\n There is nothing epic about TLJ.  Don't support this movie for the love of God.","true":true}
