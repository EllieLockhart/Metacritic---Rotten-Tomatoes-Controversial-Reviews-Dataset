From here everything is downhill\r\rHistory - 3. The first 2 hours were good\\, rest\\, damn it is absurd and bad\rCharacters - 3 - I was expecting better development in character writing\\, or at least reaching the TLOU level 1\rPlot - 2 - A plot about revenge can be very convincing\\, we have perfect examples in the industry\\, but this plot\\, far from convincing you\\, leaves you with more doubts and in the end is crap\rCharacteres - 3 - Really after having a lousy story and characters that you forget about them in 24 hours\\, do you expect the plot to be good? Bad\\, pretty poor\r\rSummary: 4\/10. The plot and the story brings the game to life\\, it seems to me that in this they forgot about it.\rOnline can be very fun.\rRecommended if only if you like apocalyptic environments and take screens.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
