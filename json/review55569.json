{"101487":156767,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a Fem-bot\\, but damn\\, they did so much dirty in this movie.  I can it's good in a certain way\\, but I really just felt bland on evening happening that I was waiting for since the force awakens. Now everyone is saying\\, \\\"oh it's not their fault that you didn't get your way\\\" true its not\\,  but dont foreshadow things if ur not planning on doing anything with it. That's like watching jumanji and reading the circle gives u ur clue of plants that are like an Amazon and then later in the film show one plant get snipped\\, like wtf that's it I thought they were like an Amazon or something. Point is this is star wars\\, it's been laid out by George Lucas from episode 4 to 6 and then from 1 to 3. Very movie gave u subtle hints then u got closure on everything within the same or next movie.  Don't get me started on the humor\\, my god\\, I couldn't have been. More annoyed with all the jokes\\, it's like they wanted to make an epic scene and then were like oh were not nerds\\, let's joke so it's cool. Star wars is suppose to be believable and it's a space war with no rules\\, idk about you but war is place for jokes\\, in some cases maybe. That just comes with the people though\\, but for this to just be a pure Disney movie and ruin what maybe the greatest saga ever\\, then I don't care for the next movie at all or the next trilogy. The movie was good in one sense\\, pure entertainment\\, but when u realize that growing up watching the REAL trilogy is for old people and we need to grow up and let go\\, then u should not make new stories up and let the original help us let go. Only one man can make these movies and he can't\\, so I won't give it a \\\" I hate it\\\" but I will say\\, \\\"DAMN\\, really fucked it up\\\". #notmyluke #johnsonsucks #georgelucasneedstocomeback","true":true}
