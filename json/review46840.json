Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well whats not to be dismayed about...\\nDestroying and belittling all the male character arcs JJ setup or one of the most beloved Star-wars characters' (Luke)\\nor stuffing SJW and Feminist views and agendas down our throats\\nSHAME ON YOU DISNEY... Kathleen Kennedy shameless posing with her all female support crew sporting :THE FORCE IS FEMALE T SHIRTS\\nWhat ever happened to going the flicks and enjoying a well written scifi....
