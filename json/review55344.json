Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love how the director managed to inject a homage to Mary Poppins into the movie.  After they put all that effort into the character Maz in the first film\\, guess they had to throw it into this movie.  A random pointless side quest that had absolutely no impact on the story\\, complete with pointless additional characters.  A few major characters that seemed to be actually interesting and important in the first film unceremoniously snuffed.  The slowest and least interesting space battle ever rendered to film.  Hero: \\\"Why don't I just fly directly to the bad guys front door and knock - what could go wrong?\\\"  Some great performances by some very talented actors\\, and some fantastic comic moments and beautiful scenery - but a horrendously flawed plot\\, and lets face it a disastrously  inappropriate \\\"Marvel Cinematic Universe\\\" approach to the subject that just doesn't work.","true":true}
