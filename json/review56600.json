Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is filled with plot holes that ruin the movie within itself and also ruining its ties to other movies in the saga. It takes too many ideas and concepts from the original trilogy and doesn't have enough unique original ideas to build on. It also takes characters from the original trilogy and makes them almost unrecognizable because they are out of character. While it does have good action there is a lack of it\\, not enough for a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
