Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie yet. Learning comes via trying and failing\\, leadership is taught (not inherited) and the Force can manifest where it needs to in order to create balance. And we all need to learn to balance malice and decency. An actual plot with clear setup for the next movie. Those \\\"throwaway scenes\\\" are essential to the movie's message; pay better attention. Okay\\, there may be plot holes and pacing issues\\, but this is a way better script that I expected and a much better movie than I expected. Well done. Actually looking forward to the next one.","true":true}
