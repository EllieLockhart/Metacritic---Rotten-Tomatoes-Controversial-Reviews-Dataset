Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would like to justify and conclude that the sequels should have not happened especially the last Jedi. All these critics praising how good of a movie this believe they are star wars fans but in reality do not understand the consistency previous movies and comics embraced which ruins the whole dynamic of it. Apart from the inconsistency\\, there are so many plot holes and loose ends that are never solved throughout the sequels. I still do not understand how people think this was a good film.","true":true}
