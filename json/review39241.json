Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film felt like an insult to fans\\, the pacing was all over the place and it felt like they couldn't decide on what tone to take. the character assassination of Luke Skywalker and the way they threw away all of the suspense and mystery built around Snoke and Rey implies that Rian Johnson has a fundamental misunderstanding of star wars.The Action scenes while visually stunning are handled in such a way that it almost requires the audience to shut off their brains and watch the pretty lights. I've been a fan of star wars my whole life\\, my earliest memories are of my dad showing me the original trilogy on our VCR and ive seen every film and TV show in the franchise. But this film and the direction it shows that disney is taking the franchise has managed to turn me off completely to one of the most beloved parts of my childhood","true":true}
