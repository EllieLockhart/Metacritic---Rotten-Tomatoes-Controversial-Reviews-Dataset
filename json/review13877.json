Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you actually liked this movie you should have yourself checked for some kind of mental disorder. Rotten tomatoes should be sued for libel for supporting this monumental sack of shit movie. If this is what a blockbuster film looks like then maybe I'll just splice together 2\/12 hours worth of film of me taking a shit. Because that's essentially what this movie is.","true":true}
