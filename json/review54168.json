Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I could rate this lower than half a star\\, I would. To be clear\\, The Last Jedi had the *most* potential of any Star Wars movie - the cinematography is *phenomenal*. The visuals are *gorgeous*. The music is\\, of course\\, fantastic. Sound and set design and acting were amazing. It has the prettiest lightsaber battles in any of the 9 films. But the plot is horrendous. There is nothing innovative about the storytelling. The writing is Non. Existent. The characters - old\\, new\\, and otherwise - are so horrendously written\\, that it feels like the story was written and re-written well into post-development\\, and it doesn't seem like the writers\\, director\\, or editors really had any clear vision of where they wanted the movie to go. The Force Awakens was mediocre and borrowed far too heavily from the original trilogy\\, but it actually introduced some fun\\, interesting characters and actually had some consistency and introduced a whole lot of really cool\\, interesting plot and character arcs that could have had great payoffs\\, but I wanted to wait until Episode 9  to really weigh in. And after seeing the entirety of the new trilogy a handful of times each\\, including back-to-back-to-back\\, and Episode 8 had a ton of cultural importance and tons of potential\\, and it left the trilogy - and the franchise - bereft of logic and sense and consistency. I don't believe that Rian Johnson is a bad director - his work with Knives Out\\, Looper\\, and Breaking Bad were nothing short of astounding\\, but what he did with this movie was an unfortunate misstep. It's unfortunate and disappointing\\, and there simply isn't enough room here to address the 'why' behind these\\, but suffice to say that what could and should have been a magnificent film and bridge between episodes 7 and 9 failed in story\\, plot\\, and character to the point that the things that it did well did not matter in the least.","true":true}
