Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars movies always seem to be fun ride and this too\\, but also quite a thinly veiled feminist\/SJW propaganda piece. When the actor himself\\, Mark Hamill\/Luke Skywalker\\, is warning you repeatedly you're handling the character completely inconsistently with the past movies\\, something is wrong..... unless you're on some sort of quest to push your social\/political values\\, rather than creating an enjoyable movie that brings people together.","true":true}
