Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi makes bold choices. It is visually different\\, and has a more comedic tone than was expected. It switches from serious and emotional to light and funny all the way through the film and packs an emotional punch too.\\nThere are moments in this film that are brilliant and up there with the best Star Wars scenes in history.\\nWell done Rian Johnson.","true":true}
