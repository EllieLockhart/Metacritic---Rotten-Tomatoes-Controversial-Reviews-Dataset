Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Both me and my friends that I saw it with loved this movie. It makes me sad to see that so many of the people that watched it didn't care much for it\\, but I can also see that it's because this movie takes a lot of risks and plays with the formula. For my part\\, I've really enjoyed the Star Wars resurgence and since I'm too young to have seen the original trilogy in the movie theaters I'm glad that I have better movies than the prequel-trilogy to watch now.","true":true}
