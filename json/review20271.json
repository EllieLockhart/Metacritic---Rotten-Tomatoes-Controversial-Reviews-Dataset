Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was so disappointing that they did not take this franchise seriously\\, by trying to appeal to the wrong audience\\, but the fact that fans were qualified of \\\"fanboys\\\" (what does it mean? That we like Star Wars too much? Duh we are the key demographic) or alt righ nazis for not liking the movie got me pissed so badly that I will make sure Disney and all their associates ex: Hasbro (one of the toy makers etc...) will never ever receive a dollar from me ever again for endorsing this garbage.","true":true}
