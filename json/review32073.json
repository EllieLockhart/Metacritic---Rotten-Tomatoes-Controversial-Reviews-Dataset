Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***Spoilers***\\n\\n\\nSeeing Yoda again was great\\, as was seeing Chewie save the day in the end. But besides that the film is a disjointed mess...the casino world was a complete waste of time that had no bearing on the plot since nothing was accomplished. It could've been thrown out and the same result would've happened for the resistance. \\n\\nAny tension Episode built with regards to the villains was thrown out. Snoke and Phasma were wasted\\, amd the Skywalkers were wiped out...surprising since Kathleen Kennedy said the Episodes would deal with the Skywalker family and then she essentially wipes them out. \\n\\nAnything special the original trilogy achieved got thrown away in Episodes VII & VIII...really wish George Lucas would come back.","true":true}
