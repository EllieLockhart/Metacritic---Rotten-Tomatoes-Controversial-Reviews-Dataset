Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was extremely disappointing. The entire casino trip was a waste of time and pointless. Not sure why the vice admiral didn't explain her plans. Snoke was set up to be this super powerful bad guy\\, but he dies so easily without explaining who he was. Most of all\\, Luke's story made no sense. It doesn't make sense that Luke\\, the guy who turned Vador\\, would give up on his nephew. It makes no sense that Luke wouldn't want to be found if he left R2D2 with a map. Last\\, why kill off Luke? Star Wars is a Skywalker saga... Now Rey has all these powers and abilities with no explanation on how she learned them. Luke had Obi-Wan and Yoda\\, who trains Rey now? Just extremely disappointing\\,  shame on Disney.","true":true}
