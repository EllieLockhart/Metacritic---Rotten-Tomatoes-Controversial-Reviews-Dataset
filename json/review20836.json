Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to say I liked it\\, insofar as I wasn't bored. But this movie fails hard on many levels. Rey is undeveloped as a character. Snoke is a McGuffin...along with almost the rest of the movie.\\n\\nI feel like even Kylo was better developed than all the other characters combined in the film. He was the only one making conflicting choices (and you'll hear \\\"conflicted\\\" frequently throughout the film\\, that's how you know he's making conflicting choices...) as where Rey is a complete Mary Sue.\\n\\nAs a movie\\, it's an enjoyable action(!) flick. As a Star Wars film\\, it feels more like a movie using the Star Wars license. No lore\\, no emotional attachment (except maybe the Porgs\\, because they need you to purchase those toys)\\, just a movie with cardboard cutouts personalities and throwaway characters. I can see why Daisy Ridley may not want to partake in more Star Wars films after the upcoming Episode 9...","true":true}
