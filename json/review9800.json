Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great 2nd installment to the new trilogy. None of the fan theories play out which is what's causing the hate. That was the whole point of the movie though anything can happen not just what you predicted which makes it great. Just like a new hope was built for the resistance in this movie a new beginning was made for future star wars movies.","true":true}
