Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was brilliant!  My kids have seen it multiple times already and it's only been out a week.  If SW had continuted on the path the movies had been heading in\\, it would have died out like the dinosaurs\\, but Rian Johnson has created something that can now be built on to grow.  The cast were all outstanding.  And the diversity looked like America to me.  Just real\\, natural diversity - not forced or fake as you see in some movies.  I highly highly recommend it and can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
