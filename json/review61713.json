Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Sorry for my bad english but i have to tell my opinion after finish the game (I bought the collector).\rI find that the game makes the events of the 1 completely useless and meaningless\\, the characters act in a completely ridiculous and insane manner\\, everything that we liked in the 1 is absolutely no longer present in this game\\, we pass half of the game playing a character that we hate without any charisma that seems far too forced\\, all that to end on a conclusion that is the opposite of something satisfactory ... There are so many gores scenes created to \\\"shock\\\" the player that after a while they lose all their impact and leave you completely numb.\r\rThe game is beautiful but it is not the most beautiful game ever created as some say\\, and although the animations are clean and worked\\, they are far from being as perfect and fluid as the gameplay of E3. Level gameplay apart from adding the dogs\\, it's exactly the same formula and the same game design as the first ...\r\rIn general I find that this game does not have 1 \/ 10th of the impact and the quality of narration that the first had\\, I do not know what Druckmann smoked when he said to have finished the game a lot and cried each time\\, because personally I felt absolutely no attachment to the story and to the new characters and I found certain scenes so clich\u00e9 that it made me look up in the sky\r\rI'm afraid of the future of Uncharted when I see what has become of this license\\, the studio that created this game seems to be totally different and the opposite of the Naughty Dog who made the games I grew up with and which I will remember all my life\u2026 Expand","true":true}
