Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe the critic reviews. They're all obviously paid off as this film is terrible. Not only does it fail as a good film in its own right\\, it actually kills the Star Wars series. Rather than rant I will just say this - Jar Jar Binks is no longer the worst thing about Star Wars thanks to this travesty.","true":true}
