Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. It's a different Star Wars movie. Dark and lightness isn't entirely clear at times as in previous movies. There are some incredible cliffhanger scenes. I was literally on the edge of my seat at times. I laughed alot and also was effected emotionally. You are going to read alot of negative reviews. I believe the reason is because this movie has an emotional effect on it's viewers. For many it might have been to much","true":true}
