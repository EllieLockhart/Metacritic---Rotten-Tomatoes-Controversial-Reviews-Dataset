Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead.\\n\\nBarelly watchable . Lea flying in space ? Vice admiral purplehead ( or what ever her name is ) ? And the stupid all powerfull Rey ? give me a break ....\\nmovie is full with crapy characters \\, subdecent plot  \\, disapointing death of Snoke and only ONE nice character who is not OP shmuck (Poe ).","true":true}
