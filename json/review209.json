It knows when to be serious but also to relax a little and not take itself to serious.  Y0 is filled with many fun mini games and side quests.  Each sidequests has it's own story and they were all pretty entertaining.

I don't really see why people would rather have Japanese dubs over English dubs but I'm not one of those people.  I would have much rather the dev's to have hired English actors for localization\\, but that's just me.  The graphics are ps4 graphics even though they look good it would be nice if they took advantage of the ps4 hardware.  The brawling system gets repetative after a while and I was so tired of the random encounters by the end of the game. Yakuza 0 is my first entry into the story and even though I enjoyed it for this most part i felt it was lacking in some areas.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
