Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do kind of feel like we are treading water here\\, like in the walking dead we need to keep the rebellion at the edge of defeat for 50 years... which is not how this triple trilogy was supposed to go -- they should be building up the new republic now\\, not back where they were in 1977.  New Han Solo isn't nearly as charismatic as old Han Solo\\, new Darth Vader isn't  as menacing as old Darth Vader\\, etc.  Lastly\\, they have added the whole \\\"skynet\\\" problem:  If the rise of one side of the force automatically rises the other side -- rise of the dark side rise the light side -- then neither side can ever win and it is just an eternal stalemate.","true":true}
