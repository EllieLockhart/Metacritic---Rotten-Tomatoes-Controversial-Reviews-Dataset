Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- Stuttering code breaker...\\n- Milking an alien cow...\\n- Crap Jedi with no powers...\\n- Bad guys that aren't scary...\\n- A slow speed chase which is 80% of the film...\\n- Fuel shortage at the main plot...\\n- Mary Poppins...\\n- Space sexting...\\n\\nThis really needs to be deleted from the franchise!!! Seriously Disney\\, how much money do you need???","true":true}
