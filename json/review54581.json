Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not even sure where to start as I'm a bit torn about the film. It was really well made and offered some incredible visuals. By most standards it was a pretty great movie.... BUT... as a Star Wars fan I could not have been more disappointed and fundamentally disagreed with every single major plot point. Don't get me wrong\\, I'm not one of the fans that hates on everything after the original trilogy. Even though the prequels suffered from some bad judgement\\, I still had a strong appreciation of the story. With the understanding that this trilogy is set to close the Skywalker saga and usher in a new era of stories\\, this story arc just felt wrong in so many ways. Echoing what others have said\\, some of the comedic aspects were unwelcome additions and oddly placed at points within the story. The many twists in the movie did not leave me in awe or bring excitement... more like Wtf? Why did they do that? The only feelings that I was left with were disappointment and the hope that once this story arc ends they truly start with a clean slate.","true":true}
