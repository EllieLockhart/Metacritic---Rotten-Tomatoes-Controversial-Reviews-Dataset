Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great film to learn in film school how to not do films.\\n\\nSo many errors in screenplay\\, writing\\, directing more than you can count.\\n\\nGreat visuals but that's only to distract you from this cinematic disaster.\\n\\nRyan should be ashamed by his creation.","true":true}
