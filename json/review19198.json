Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like Rian Johnson saw all movies and thought: \\n\\\"Nah dont want that! I dont care! I do my own thing! \\nSnoke? dont care! \\nPhasma? Dont care! \\nJedi Master Luke? Dont care! \\nReys history? dont care! \\nThe force? whatever we want\\nForce training? why do you need training?\\n\\nF the old fans\\, Star Wars is for young kids\\, we need fun\\, we need comedy\\, humor\\, selling toys. Its not supposed to be serious! we dont care. It needs to be like superheros! We dont care about the history! Skywalkers? pff... dont care. The old should die!\\\"","true":true}
