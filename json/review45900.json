Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very well made film! While there were definitely a lot of unexpected occurrences and certain plot elements that I would have like to see move in different directions\\, I think this is a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga. I will need to watch this one multiple times to fully formulate an opinion.","true":true}
