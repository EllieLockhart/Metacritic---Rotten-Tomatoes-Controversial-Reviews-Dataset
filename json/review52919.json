Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A nihilist masterpiece.  It made me not only conclude that the movie was pointless\\, but the whole series is pointless. Maybe movies as a whole are pointless. It is that nihilistic. We have gone from a new hope to no hope. Calling it sad would be a compliment.","true":true}
