Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Movie:\\nUnlike the lackluster 7th Episode\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a step in the right direction. Although there are a few rough moments\\, referencing the scene with Leia and her sudden dues-ex-machina force abilities as her death grows imminent\\, it's good moments far out way the bad. TLJ is a Star Wars film\\, not a Abrams film.\\n\\nThe Audience:\\nI believe this is what has caused the polarization in both viewing an take away. Many assumed that TLJ would be a continuation of the re-visualization of Star Wars\\, that in my opinion\\, had begun to slowly destroy the franchise. However\\, TLJ brings back what was good in the old\\, with a stand alone story line that wraps up Luke's journey nicely\\, and is leading the trilogy in a more memorable and independent direction. The franchise is looking up since the worrying release of The Force Awakens.","true":true}
