Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was probably the worst star wars movie ever. When I went to see it I was hoping for to get the questions answered from the previous film\\, but instead\\, I was left with no depth and pointless explanation. The action scenes were not that good\\, characters were shallow\\, the script was brainless and there were too much comedy aspect everywhere. It is disgraceful to release a movie like this to the fans. The fans deserve a better movie. Also\\, stupid Disney fucked us up really good and I hope they lose a lot of money on every star wars movie release from now on because of this disaster.","true":true}
