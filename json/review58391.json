Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing The Last Jedi\\, it is now very safe to say\\, this trilogy and the Disney adaptations of Star Wars don't belong in the official Star Wars cannon developed by George Lucas. They have completely built their own ideas\\, disregarding the originality and classic ideology which made Lucas' originals so great. I honestly have a very hard time understanding the high praise from critics\\, aside from the production value and visual effects. In fact\\, production value and visual effects may be the only thing good about this movie. The Last Jedi struggles with pacing so much I didn't know what emotion to feel at any moment during the movie and at the end I found myself being disappointed\\, lost\\, bored\\, and very angry. This movie is a disappointing experience to say the least. Rian Johnson stretched and forced a new experience in effort to create a new\\, bold direction but failed to remember the strong\\, loyal fan base behind the saga. He took all the lore and ideology of all it's predecessors and threw them in the trash\\, beginning a new adaptive version of Star Wars that does not fit with its originals. I am sad for the direction this movie takes this beloved saga and can only hope JJ Abrams can save it with episode 9. It's truly difficult to sum up all the disappointment this movie presents without referencing every plot point in the entire movie. I signed the petition.","true":true}
