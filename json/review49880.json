Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You can spray perfume on dogshit and it'll still stink.\\n\\nThe same goes for this movie. As much as Disney and critics want to shove this crap down our throats\\, the story of this movie makes it impossible. If anything\\, the critics and Disney are losing their credibility. \\n\\nJust simple an awful movie period. I'll boycott Star Wars and anything being offered by Disney.\\n\\nRemember\\, we are the ones spending the money\\, and best thing to do is not give it to them.","true":true}
