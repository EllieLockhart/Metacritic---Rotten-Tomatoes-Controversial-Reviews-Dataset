But actually i wasnt able to force myself to finish it.\rFirst of all it has just too many cutscenes. And i think there are better ways to tell a story. Other games\\, like for example MGS also have very long cutscenes\\, but at least they offer great gameplay besides them. In Yakuza gameplay is very weak. Its not open world per se\\, its just bunch of streets and thats all. You cant drive or shoot which is very disappointing for open world crime game. Fighting feels like mindless button mashing\\, it has nothing to do with great fighting systems from modern games like Batman Arkham series\\, not to mention slasher-figthing games like DMC or Bayonetta. Yakuza just feels old and clunky.\rSubstories are supposed to be funny\\, but are just stupid\\, illlogical and dont fit dark atmosphere of game. There are a lot of boring fetch quests that will waste your time but wont be fun or memorable and side activities are equally bad and uninteresting.\rOverall i wanted to love this game\\, but i just cant. Its just old\\, archaic and not fun when compared to modern games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
