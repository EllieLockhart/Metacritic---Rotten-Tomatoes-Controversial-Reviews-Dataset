{"101487":129585,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am pretty much agreeing on most of the negative aspects this movie has which already have been pointed out by many others here. But there are a few very important lore aspects I would like to elaborate a little on.\\n\\n1. First off is the crystal-clear message given from Disney that what matters in this universe now is the deconstruction\\, end\\, death\\, of the Jedi\\, the Jedi Order and its whole teachings. This has for some reason no more meaning any more\\, and force users now apparently no longer need to train in the use of the force\\, and their force abilities will develop in a matter of days\\, not years.\\n \\nIts only one problem with this\\, force users have been rather rare through out the universe and they have powers that are almost godlike compared to \\\"ordinary\\\" beings. This means the force users would rule (and easily terrorize) whole populations if they should choose so. \\n\\nHere is where the Jedi Order makes so much sense and why it has prospered in the universe for so long.\\nThe Jedi Order\\, its teaching and codes\\, has been the one pillar throughout the universe that has secured peace so long by educating and teaching self-constraint to force talents. The Jedi Order also protected force talents from abuse from others (and from themselves) by identifying these force sensitives early and bringing them into a protected and somewhat spiritual setting. \\nWhat we are left with now is that every criminal\\, evildoer\\, mob-organization\\, Sith remnants or dictators have been given a cart blanche to take on\\, kidnap\\, pay\\, coheres or otherwise trick force users into their malevolent service. And added to that are just those crazed or just pure evil individual force users who go on their own crusade against anyone who dares to confront them. Really\\, why wouldn't you just use your powers to rob every bank\\, take anyone as hostages or slaves\\, or just run your own criminal empire as long no one really can stop you? Seems like Disney is leaning very heavy on that the \\\"good\\\" in everyone from now on will the guide force talents.....yeah as we don't know what true power can do to people......\\nCombine this with what looks like a more random popups of powerful force users (Yeah\\, Rey and random boy\\, I'm ogling you)\\, Disney have just set up a universe on the brink of unforeseen chaos.\\n\\n2. Added to all these powerful force talents running around without any order or codex to guide them\\, we are also introduced to force ghosts who can interact with the physical world\\, well not only that\\, they can use force lightning and set things on fire! Hmmm\\, we really must hope that all force spirits are enlighted and act out of love and altruism. A tiny bit hard to actually see this\\, as even Yoda the most spiritual of the Jedi\\, just went on the set a tree on fire (and the whole Jedi Order symbolically) without any thought of\\, or means to stop a fire getting out of control.....\\n\\n3. Then we have what so many here have commented on\\, weaponizing hyperspace travel (lightspeed travel). I always understood the travel by lightspeed as just a \\\"saying\\\"\\, and that actual hyper space travel was a variant of wormhole\\, bending of time\/space. Real travel through the universe at lightspeed or faster would be an impossibility\\, because spaceships would be shredded to pieces even when hitting just grains of sand. Steering a craft in these speeds would probably also be a pretty hard job....\\n\\nBut anyway\\, what we got in this universe (or should we just say Disneyverse)\\, is a very easily obtainable superweapon\\, as even small crafts like x-wings can achieve \\\"lightspeed\\\" (whatever that means now). Of course\\, the first ones to take advantage of such a cheap and ferocious weapon would be mad\\, evil people.... for example.....hmmmm representatives of the First Order? Just hold on to your hats\\, there is going be a lot of whizzing streaks of lights throughout the universe as rebels\\, resistance groups\\, Sith\\, the First Order or any other Empire remnants are going to launch droid controlled starships on every conceivable target there is. Kaaboom! \\nSo\\, so\\, so much cheaper and simpler than building death stars that gets blown up all the time anyway. I don't have the correct physics in front of me\\, but I guesstimate that a large star destroyer\\, at lightspeed\\, would probably actually destroy a star or planet if thou so whishes! Glorious! The not-so-bright First Order comedians are probably kicking a lot of shins for not having this idea first....but at least they now really can get some fireworks going off around the block.\\n\\nWell to conclude\\, Disney have happily set up the universe for a fantastic age of brilliant chaos and mayhem; unchecked insanely powerful force users\\, revengeful lightning wielding force ghosts\\, and of course lightspeed missiles everywhere! I am really looking forward to the next movie with all this going on\\, it will be the most spectacular Star Wars movie to this date! Not kidding\\, I would go watch this any day!\\n\\nOn a (little bit) more serious closing note\\, the only way as I see that Disney can make the next movie make any sense at all\\, is to reveal Rey as the ultimate evil Sith\/Knight of Ren\\, being a secretly highly trained dark side force user that really has fooled everyone\\, tricking even Snoke and Luke Skywalker causing their demise. Kylo Ren then actually in the end turns to the light side\\, and goes to town on Rey. Then we end up with a Skywalker who again saves the universe\\, builds up the Jedi Order and brings peace to the universe! (He unfortunately did kill Solo though\\, which will give a bit bitter aftertaste)\\n  \\nOne star given is purely because of Mark Hamill (and his honesty about this movie) and in loving memory of Princess Leia\\, Carrie Fischer.","true":true}
