Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kylo Ren and Rey wre the only light in this very very dark time for this saga. And they messed that up too\\,  having them fall right back into old tropes after surprising us with something new. JJ Abram's should feel ashamed for leaving Rian with not much to work with and Rian should just stop trying to rationalize his decisions which both destroy the soul of The Star Wars saga and ultimately add up to a formulaic Pirates of the Caribbean or Marvel movie in The Star Wars universe.  This was no Star Wars and I will not be paying to see Episode 9.","true":true}
