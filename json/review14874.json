Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand why so called critics say that this is one of the best Star Wars movies. Most actors are good\\, characters are interesting\\, action is good but jokes feel out of place\\, common sense ignored completely. Also Disney criticizing capitalism is weird. Such a wasted opportunity. This is not longer Star Wars. Disappointing.","true":true}
