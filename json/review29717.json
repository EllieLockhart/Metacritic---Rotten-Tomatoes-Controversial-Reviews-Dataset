Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson understandably took some risks with the new installment in the Star Wars franchise\\, and it definitely shows. This movie\\, while having it's low points\\, definitely hits more than misses. While sticking with the same characters\\, this movie is more centralized on character development rather than establishing a universe. If you're a Star Wars fan\\, or even just a movie movie fan in general\\, I'd certainly recommend giving this one a watch.","true":true}
