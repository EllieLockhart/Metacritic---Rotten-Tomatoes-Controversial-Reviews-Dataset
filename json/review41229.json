Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie introduced a number of new characters at the expense of of ones we'd just started caring about.  It gleefully assaulted everything anyone loved about the movies that came before\\, and it presented us with plots that (a) had enormous holes in them (b)were a total aside to the main story\\, and (c) served to push character or moral agendas rather than tell a story.\\n\\nThe movie features the gorgeous effects you expect from Star Wars\\, and has competent battle scenes and occasional funny moments.\\n\\nLong story short\\, if you're going to rewrite Star Wars\\, you're going to have to do it well.  I feel like in an effort to shed the past\\, we're left with a far lesser successor.","true":true}
