Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's tough to enjoy a movie when half of the storyline is terrible. The Rose and Finn storyline feels forced and unnecessary\\, you're wishing you could fast forward through it the entire time. A lot of themes and looming questions from Force Awakens are eliminated or have very unsatisfactory answers to them. I was really disappointed with this movie because they really had all of the elements to make it truly great. Just a complete miss... the franchise shouldn't be trusted with Rian Johnson.","true":true}
