Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't get past the ridiculous Leia\\, flying and not dead\\, through outer space.  One of the dumbest things I have ever seen\\, and shameful for this movie.  I thought Luke would be a powerful Jedi in full control of the force\\, like Yoda\\, but he is a weak little baby?  Shameful again.  Enough with the jokes already.  Shame.........ding-ding-ding\\,.......... SHAME!","true":true}
