Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out of the movie confused and then as time went on realised how much I hated it.  \\n\\nTFA was all about finding a map that Luke had made to be able to then find Luke's island. TLJ was all about getting to the island and then Luke saying he didn't want anyone to find him??!  This is also the same Luke that could see the goodness in Darth Vader despite all the evil\\, to then wanting to kill his own nephew after catching just a glimpse of some darkness in him.\\n\\nThis movie basically destroys all Luke's character from the previous movies. And how they treated Admiral Ackbar showed no regard for a 30 year old character.","true":true}
