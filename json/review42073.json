Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie never answers any of the audiences questions that were created in Force Awkens. Who are Ray's parents? Who is Snoke? Why can Ray use the force? What will Luke Sky Walker do? Does he know about Snoke? The movie leaves you with only questions and gives you no reason to want to see the next Star Wars because to many horrible dicisions have already been made.","true":true}
