Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a standalone space fantasy movie its OK...counting out some big plot flaws and implausible character interaction. Biggest problem with the movie is that it completely disregards character traits\\, technology assumptions and plot lines that made-up the starwars world. Its easy to make up unexpected plot twists if you don't have to worry if they make sense or build on top of the plot set up so far.....very sloppy chapter.....if this franchise survives this it will not be about the \\\"story\\\" anymore...","true":true}
