Gameplay has been tweaked and is a fun loop of explore-scavenge-craft-combat that improves on the 1st game with subtle but much needed changes.\r\rStory wise\\, this is a game that asks you to understand multiple view points and to empathise with even your worst enemy. The mature themes on display here ask you to look deeper than simply your attachment to the 1st games characters. You will be forced to confront loss\\, anger and a need for retribution but then come out the other side to see the bigger picture that 'narratively speaking' tests your ability to empathize with a fellow human being and your compassion. And yes the game is quite dark in narrative but like the first game there is always a glimmer of hope throughout given by those surrounding you during your journey.\r\rThe ending will leave you thinking. But I felt a sense of satisfaction that this story has come full circle and made sense in the grander scheme of things. It's not a fairytale ending by any means. But if you played through this game and expected a happy ending then you missed the point of your characters journey.\r\rI highly recommend The Last of Us 2 to mature minded gamers who want to play a game that presents a gritty experience with it's confronting themes and narrative. If your someone who will take offence to a story not providing you with constant positive feedback then your not going to have a good time here. But I have no issue giving this game my strongest of recommendations. Thank you Naughty Dog & all the actors\/actresses\\, the world you created is just a stunning achievement. BRAVO!!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
