Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a really awesome movie that took me back 40 years ago when u saw the first Star Wars. Sure there were some things I wish they would of done differently but overall I had a blast.
