Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u0092ve never been a huge Star Wars fan\\, but quite enjoyed The Force Awakens. After hearing a lot of negativity about this film I was curious to see what had the fanboys\u0092 knickers in such a twist. I\u0092m still not sure as I actually enjoyed this a whole lot. Rey (Daisy Ridley) arrives to ask Luke Skywalker for help. Luke isn\u0092t into the Jedi stuff anymore\\, indeed he rejects it\\, chucking the prized light sabre over his shoulder (disrespecting those fans who take their Jedi religion VERY seriously I think.)\\nMeanwhile the rebels are in trouble\\, with Poe all fired up to fight while Leia and General Laura Dern try to reign him in. Finn and adorable new character Rose head off on some side mission. Meanwhile Rey is having weird psychic conversations with Kylo Ren(Adam Driver). \\nThere is a lot going on in this film\\, and writer\/ director Rian Johnson makes bold choices having Luke reject the Jedi way\\, Leia discover some Jedi tricks of her own\\, having lots of women in charge\\, visiting a casino planet in a slightly pointless but entertaining sidebar. There are several funny throwaway lines (several suggested by the late Carrie Fisher apparently) that again\\, might have raised some of the ire of the fanboys. \\nFor me\\, the reverence and seriousness a lot of people have for this franchise has always been a mystery. (While I can totally buy into JK Rowling\u0092s Potter-verse so it\u0092s not that I don\u0092t get it. I just don\u0092t subscribe to the Jedi way.) With the sad death of Carrie Fisher last year and Kylo Ren\u0092s insistence of leaving old ways to die and moving on\\, this film is like a Millennial\u0092s Star Wars - throw off the old\\, bring in the new\\, and that isn\u0092t a message long time fans like I guess.\\nFor a casual fan like me\\, I admired the visual storytelling and nicely developed relationships.","true":true}
