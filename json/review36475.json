Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most well directed Star Wars film to date. So visually pleasing it is almost unbelievable. Does not conform to the expected Star Wars plot line which is exactly what the franchise needed. The character development and appearances from familiar faces tie the film together making it a classic for the ages. ","true":true}
