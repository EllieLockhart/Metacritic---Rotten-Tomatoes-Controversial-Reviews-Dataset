Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"certainly not like i expected\\, and not a perfect movie by any means.. but\\, despite many things going completely differently than I had initially hoped\\, i cant deny that i left the theater very pleased. it was a great act 2 for a trilogy\\, and i was blown away by some of the cinematography and visuals. if i remove my own pre-conceived biases\\, it was just a great movie to watch and really a new look at Star Wars.. and thats what many Gen X'ers also fail to realize\\, this movie is largely for a whole new generation of fans.. bot just for old dudes like myself. and i think they succeeded in breaking new ground and setting up a completely unknown final act. i cant wait to see ep. 9.
