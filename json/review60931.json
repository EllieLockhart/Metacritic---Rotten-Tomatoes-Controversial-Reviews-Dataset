Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I think Joel should have died. As much as I admire the character of Joel\\, I understand the decision to use his past against him in order to provide a motive for Ellie's revenge; just not the way he did. We as a fan base didn't deserve that\\, and Joel and Ellie did not deserve that as characters. I hated everyone in this game. They're all  depressing. The world is grim. Joel's a cuck. His brother is the tough guy\\, who\\, btw\\, gets **** in this game. Joel forgets all his street cred. **** you Joel. He's nothing but a bully\\, no heart in this game. No depth. So uninteresting. The only GOOD part in the game\\, personally\\, was the flashback of Ellies birthday\\, around the same age that was from the first game. I'll admit it\\, I ****ing cried during that scene where she pretended to go to space. I felt so bad for Ellie. She's such a innocent character\\, she deserves so much more than what she ends up with. I hated her in this game. She grew up to resent the world she so desperately wanted to save. That birthday scene\\, it reminded me so much of the first game\\, so I thought\\, why if it is evident that the quality of the first game can be reflected\\, what the **** is this? I mean\\, you can't even kill Abby? What the ****s her name? Abbi? What the **** You kill all these people\\, waste all these lives\\, Jesse died for you Ellie\\, what? You can't just count a few seconds longer? **** whoever wrote this. You don't care about us. I don't care who Abby ****s\\, I don't care. I don't care. What I care about is this game being a ****ING \u2026 Expand","true":true}
