Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Guess I'll have to watch Rogue One again\\, for the fourth time\\, to wash the memory of this horrible film from my mind!\\n\\nTied for the worst Star Wars movie ever!\\n\\nI haven't written a movie review in years\\, but as a fan who grew up on Star Wars and loves this franchisee. I felt it's my duty to share the word of how AWFUL this movie is. Disney is destroying our beloved Star Wars\\, not smart for company who's investing heavily in it. Another stink-bomb like this and I won't want to visit Star Wars Land in 2019!\\n\\nWithout breaking down the movie I'll share this. I'm tired pf PC characters with no depth\\, plot holes larger than a galaxy\\, and gratuitous product placement to the point of wanting to gag.\\n\\nThis film simply put is lazy\\, boring\\, and devoid of any emotion.... One of the worst ever.\\n\\nI had big hopes for Star Wars just coming off of last years Rogue One\\, which I thought was awesome. Thought they'd bring some of that level of character building and storytelling to Last Jedi\\, but they didn't and it showed. As I said earlier it's time to watch Rogue One again as to wash the memory of this horrible film from my mind.","true":true}
