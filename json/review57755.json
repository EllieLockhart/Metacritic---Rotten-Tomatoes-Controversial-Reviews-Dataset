Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing\\, to say the least. The movie was very disjointed and seemed to have no plot whatsoever. I don't think the director and writers had any idea of where they were heading\\, so they just started filming and hoping it worked. The story did not really advance at all and I think you could skip this one and not miss a beat. There were so many missed opportunities to make that movie pop\\, but they missed in almost all of them. The forced romance of Rose and Finn is garbage and unnatural. The stupid jokes in the beginning were so out of place\\, felt like they were trying to be the guardians of the Galaxy but fell woefully short. I hate to pile on Carrie Fisher\\, but I couldn't tell between her real acting and what they had to CGI\\, she was awful and they should have let Leia die in the beginning of the show. So much was wrong in this movie\\, it was really sad. Where the movie was right was with Luke and his reaction to Rey. I think that he was fantastic\\, but they seem to want to destroy all of the icons in this franchise. The jump to light speed attack was sweet\\, really cool. And the Snoke takedown scene with Kylo and Rey was fantastic. I wish they would stick to what worked in the beginning of the movie franchise\\, not try to reinvent into something it isn't. Overall\\, I am very disappointed and hope that the next one is better\\, but I don't really have high hopes for that happening. This was the last Jedi movie I may go and see\\, so they might have gotten the name right...","true":true}
