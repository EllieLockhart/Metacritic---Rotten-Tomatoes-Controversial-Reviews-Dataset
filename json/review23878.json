Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Major Disappointment.  Editing is both lacking and poorly executed. Character's personalities (compared to the Force Awakens) are either backwards or randomly warped.  Not enough action.  Comparable to the let down for Star Wars fans who didn't like the prequels. Too much hype around theories and as a devoted Star Wars fan this movie was a major let down. Rian Johnson ruined the narrative arc setup in TFA.","true":true}
