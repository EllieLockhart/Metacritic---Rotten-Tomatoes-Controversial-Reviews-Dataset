Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first Star Wars film I actually feel disappointed in. So I have waited for 20 years to see Luke Skywalker on screen again and Luke Skywalker was one of my many childhood heroes growing up. And Disney\/Lucasfilm has done something unwise to him in order for the new generation to shine. Namely character assassination.\\n\\nAnd the boring and totally unnecessary Canto Bight story was just a way for Disney to sell more plush Fathier toys and merchandise. I learnt nothing significantly new about the Force and cannot believe the Luke that used love and compassion to help his father to redeem himself will go on & do something so out of character to his own nephew.\\n\\nDisney has ruined the character of Luke Skywalker and my childhood hero deserved better than this character assassination. The two stars above are for Mark Hamill's amazing & breadth-taking performance and for Carrie Fisher's brilliant turn as our eternal Princess of Alderaan.\\n\\nThis will not be a film I will rewatch. Luke deserved better.","true":true}
