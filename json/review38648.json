Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie since Phantom. What a mess Ryan Johnson made of our heroes. Leia floating in space\\, a pointless mission to a gambling planet\\, Snoke easily dispatched and who is he? Rey's parents are huh? Captain Phasma early defeated AGAIN. So many issues. I'm so disappointed in this film. I refuse to accept it as part of Star Wars cannon! Sad!","true":true}
