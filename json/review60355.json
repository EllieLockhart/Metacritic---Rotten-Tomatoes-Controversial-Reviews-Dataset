It's easily the best PS4 exclusive games imo. The graphics add so much to the scenery and environments are nothing short of amazing\\, the PS4 was being pushed to its limits with this game. The score is simplistic and subtle which matches the tone and it knows when to shut up and let you figure out how to feel as you explore an abandoned house and find a suicide note next to a skeleton instead of playing stock sad music like \\\"HEY KID THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU THINK OH THAT'S SAD\\\". The game play is masterful. the enemy variation makes everything interesting like say you were in an intense stealth section where you are being hunted by the WLF but there's also a clicker or two in the environment\\, do you stealth kill the clicker and get it out of the way or do you throw a bottle and let it thin out some of the WLF. combat encounters like these force you to work out strategies on the fly and if your first strategy doesn't play out well then try another and find one that suits the situation. finally the one that most take issue with\\, the big one... the story. now this is a very subjective part but I'm going to try to explain what I like so this part is entirely from me\\, if you disagree then dog bless. the story is a game about hatred which provides a great contrast to the first game which is about love. all the characters are well written and the dialogue is great\\, some of Naughty Dogs best work in fact. all the veteran characters are handled well and organically. all of their decisions align with their personality in the first game. The new characters are all welcome additions that are hard not to love or hate. I was okay with the controversial choices made with these characters that others seemed to dislike and I fell for the first shocker of the story that had me hooked until the credits rolled. it's a fantastic game and is worth every penny of the price\\, the best PS4 has to offer.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
