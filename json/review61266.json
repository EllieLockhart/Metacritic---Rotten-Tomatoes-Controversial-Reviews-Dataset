The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"So\\, I finally ended the game. I understand now the feelings and rage about this game. Like Joel said if he can go back to that day\\, he make everything again. And I think\\, anyone who love somebody like he loved her\\, do the same. Like Abby tried to revenge her father too. But\\, the biggest (for me) error is they make us play too much as Abby and make us almost kill Ellie.For me\\, this game was a 3rd game. For 2nd game\\, maybe a Ellie's journey to find out about herself\\, the fireflies\\, be angry with Joel\\, forgive him and more with Joel. Give us some background about her\\, about Dina. Show us how that small camp grows that big. Something without killing all main characters.They make us love a man\\, a hero and just killed on the beginning in a non human way and worse\\, making Ellie see all that. Seeing a '' father '' be killed on that way\\, is brutal. But I have to say something good. 10\/10 about graphics\\, gameplay\\, music\\, voice and movement acting\\, and much more. You can see those actors give life to their characters with love and passion. Ashley Johnson is brilliant and no one can say otherwise with reason. Seeing her passion for Ellie is everything. About Troy... Idk what he felt when he knew about killing Joel so early... But I bet he felt bad.I loved that museum part\\, her birthday was perfect. You can see the shine in her eyes\\, and Joel was soo happy to see all that. I rated 2\/10 about the bad feeling I have in all the game. Anger\\, sadness\\, disgust\\, chills and too much violence\\, blood and human\/animals deaths. The Last of Us isn't about zombie survival anymore. If I wanted to kill humans\\, I get COD or something... False advertising\\, naughty dog's version COD in a good graphics = Tlou2If they make another I don't want to play it... Ended with uncharted and tlou. Good!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
