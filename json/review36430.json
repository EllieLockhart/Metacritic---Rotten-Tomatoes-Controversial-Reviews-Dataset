Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most frustrating installment to date.  The film has all of the elements of a good movie:  acting\\, dialogue\\, cinematography\\, etc.  What it lacks is a cohesive plot giving meaning to anything that goes up onscreen.  Big things happen but they happen in a void without making any sense.  The Force Awakens had flaws but at least it made sense in terms of the story it was trying to tell.  This told us a story no one really needed.   The entire resistance\/Canto Blight storyline seemed out of place and only used to give the non-jedi characters something to do during Rey's \\\"training\\\".  The may not be the worst movie in the Star Wars saga but it is definitely the most dissappointing","true":true}
