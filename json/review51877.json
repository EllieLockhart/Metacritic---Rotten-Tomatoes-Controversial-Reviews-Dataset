Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few of the story points felt a little rushed and could have been fleshed out a little more for greater depth\\, but overall a great addition to the Star Wars series!","true":true}
