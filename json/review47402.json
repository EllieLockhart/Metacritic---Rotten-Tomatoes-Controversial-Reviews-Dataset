Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What on Kashyyyk were they thinking\\, that flying Leia scene\\, that whole Casino theme\\, the most bland space chase ever\\, Luke being nothing like he was supposed to...nothing works! Full of agendas and no room left for the stories that the previous episode set up. the only good parts is the very brief team up fight with Kylo and Rey\\, and some cool visuals...rest is terrible.","true":true}
