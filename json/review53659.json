Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forced humour (excuse the pun)\\, a pointless side quest\\, zero development amongst the new characters\\, weak and confused remaining antagonist after pointlessly doing away with the stronger one\\, shock value moments that leave the trilogy in tatters\\, throwaway lines that ruin all JJ's carefully built up plot points\\, the assassination of Luke's character\\, the Mary Poppins moment\\, the complete underuse of Chewie\\, Threepio and Artoo\\, battles that had zero excitement or dynamics\\, the milk\\, having the Jedi temple on Fraggle Rock and basing the entire plot around a Battlestar Galactica episode about running out of fuel\\, total Mary Sue protagonist. I've loved these movies since I was 7 years old but this was simply mediocrity personified. Managed to ruin both episode 7 and 9... have zero interest in anything Star Wars related going forward... and not even the prequels managed that. Actually\\, the ONE good thing I can say about this travesty of a movie is it made me appreciate the prequels more! That's what the half a star is for. I could seriously and honestly go on and on listing 70 or 80 plot-holes and horrible writing\/directing\/editing\/pacing\/forshadowing (or lack of) issues with this movie. It's a train-wreak of a movie even from a pure movie-craft POV\\, but plenty of others have already done that here\\, youtube and elsewhere.","true":true}
