Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star because it has some elements of a good film - the effects and the acting by the Daisy\\, Adam and Mark Hamill.  However there were so many faults with the plot\\, character arcs\\, force surprises that just can't be overlooked.  This was the first\\, and only\\, Star Wars film I've ever seen that made me seriously question why I loved Star Wars so much.  Even the prequels\\, with their stilted dialogue and lack of a convincing character arc for Anakin\\, I still managed to like overall.  However this one is pretty much garbage throughout.","true":true}
