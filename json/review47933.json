Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I personally disagree with where they took the Luke character I did feel it fit within this realm. Over all I think this movie has surpassed most if not all the other films in scope. I really enjoyed this film and cant wait to see what Abrams does with the next episode.","true":true}
