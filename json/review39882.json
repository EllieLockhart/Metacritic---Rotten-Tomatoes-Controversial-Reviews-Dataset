Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a weak story.  It steals from episode 5 and 6.  Luke in hiding doesn't make sense.  Rey being a Jedi master with zero training is unbelievable.  I won't waste money again in the theater for a lame movie like this one.","true":true}
