Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a second viewing to truly process what I saw\\, my verdict is that it was a great movie and it's strengths far outweighed it's weaknesses... It's in my top 3 of all the Star Wars movies! ","true":true}
