There is nothing entertaining in killing one of the main characters for no good reason \/at least at the begging of the game\/ especially if that character is very likable. If this game was some other generic survival shooter no body would care but we are talking here about sequel of hte LoU - one of the best games on PS3 and PS4. The high sales on this game are only because of the expectations. Now those expectations are ruined and the next weeks will see a lot of people selling their copies of the game. Really sad true - the story destroyed this game. Also the unethical practice of Sony to attack streamers\\, to obviously pay people to write 10\/10 user and critics reviews make me reconsider if it is good idea for me in the future to buy game on preorder or digitaly. Also the critics prove that they don't work accurately - when more than 56 000 people \/at the moment of this opinion\/ are saying that the game is not good that proves that the critics have to reconsider how they work and even stop been critics - no body wants false paid reviews!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
