Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching the Last Jedi was a lot like going on a date with a beautiful person that has no personality- very nice to look at\\, but no substance.  This is the first time I fell asleep during a Star Wars movie.  It's also the first time I have seen a Star Wars movie only once in the theatre.  Ii","true":true}
