Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash! BIG TURD! When there was action it was good. It seemed like the spent too much time setting up for future possibilities instead of giving the consumer a good product now. Nothing flowed or was well explained... It was better that green lantern for whatever that's worth","true":true}
