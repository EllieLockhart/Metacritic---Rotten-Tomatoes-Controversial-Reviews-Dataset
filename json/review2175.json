Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible film made up of wonderful parts. I loved The Force Awakens so this was a real disappointment. I loved the casting and the new characters were excellent\\, but as a whole this was a terribly clumsy film. At several points even the editing fell apart.\\n\\nAs a side note\\, all of these 'the audience are wrong and the critics are right' articles are terribly suspicious. I wonder how much money Disney is paying for all this influence.","true":true}
