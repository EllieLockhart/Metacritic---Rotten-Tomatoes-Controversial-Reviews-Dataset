Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I gave this movie two stars as a gift.  I feel that it did not follow the true spirit of Star Wars. I considered myself to be a pretty big fan of this franchise at one time but  this movie really killed it for me. The story flies in the face of nearly everything about the 'Force' that was told in the original trilogy.  The actors did a great job with what they had to work with and the cinematography was superb\\, but the story was full of holes\\, contradictions\\, and did not leave me anxious for the next film at all. Oh\\, and thanks for turning my childhood favorite movie into a feminist political platform.","true":true}
