Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film by far.  Where episode 7 was a bland retread of episode 4\\, this is a rippoff of episode 5 in reverse with elements of episode 6 and 1.  This movie ignores character arcs\\, universe rules\\, and common sense to push weird political narratives and burn every bridge it can with the average viewer in the process.\\n\\n Then there are the structural issues.  The impressive number gaping plot holes alone put Michael Bay's transformers franchise to shame.  The utter lack of continuity with not only the original 6 films but the force awakens.  None of the characters actions fall in line within their pre established status.  Many lines and actions have no meaning to the story by the next scene.  This movie is a mess.\\n\\nThen the worst part is the reversal and destruction of the entire reason star wars is a successful franchise.  The total bastardization of Luke Skywalker and his legacy.  There are no reasons or excuses to justify how this made it to film.  \\n\\nThis movie stands as a testament to how not to make a successful film.  If the goal was to kill the franchise\\, then it did that quite well.","true":true}
