Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars yet.  No sense of unity.  Made lots of promises about Snoke and Luke\\, but never delivered.  Pacing was all over the place.  No real sense of danger to the main characters as they were miraculously saved again and again.  The artificial suspense seemed to be for the purpose of taking up screen time.  Character motivations were nebulous and without purpose.  Attempts at character development ultimately were unconvincing.  Luke's reasoning for his decisions made no sense.  Kylo's origin story was interesting and believable\\, but how the other characters fit into that was hastily written.  Technical explanations for the main plot point\\, which was the never ending chase sequence\\, fell short and seemed easily remedied by the First Order by a short hyperspace jump.  Method of tracking through hyperspace was \\\"mind-blowing\\\" to characters\\, but then never dealt with in any significant way.  Hyperspace jump solution by vice admiral was intriguing\\, but we are left wondering why this was not executed earlier.  The planet Krayt seemed out of place and randomly inserted\\, except for the fact that it resembled Hoth.  Seemed like they were trying to create a cyclical death and birth of the Star Wars story\\, which is interesting\\, but lackluster in practice as every subsequent film becomes a rehash of the previous story with new names but same plot.  At the end I was left not feeling attached to any of the characters\\, and like Kylo\\, wished I could just sweep it all the ground and let it burn.  Kylo seems to the director personification\\, or shall we say corporate personification. Kylo is the embodied Disney company\\, killing off everyone to start anew\\, and the audiences\\, much like Rey\\, want no part in this madness.","true":true}
