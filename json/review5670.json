Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't work for me. The acting came off as horrible. Lena Dunham (who I like in many things) seemed so miscast and Fischer and Hamill (both\\, interesting people but not the best actors) were pretty bad as well.  It felt like the whole thing was filmed in front of a green screen with the actors trying way to hard to make something out of nothing.","true":true}
