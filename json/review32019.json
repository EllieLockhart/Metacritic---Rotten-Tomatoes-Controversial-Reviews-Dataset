Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers here.   I'm going to give this movie the lowest score possible because it's the worst Star Wars movie to date.  It's the first time seeing a Star Wars movie where I left the theater feeling completely disappointed.  Even the prequels\\, as difficult as they are to watch at times\\, had better overall moments than this one -- not to say TLJ didn't have them but they were few and far between.  I think the biggest problem I have with TLJ is what they did with Luke Skywalker\\, the hero of the Original Trilogy\\, this time turning him into a passive character.  The universe needs him and he's pretty much like\\, \\\"Nah\\, don't wanna\\\"\\, attempting to destroy the mythology of the Jedi as if the first seven episodes were pure folly in focusing on the power of the Jedi Order.  Plus\\, whatever happened to the \\\"Master and Apprentice\\\" thing set up by Lucas?  Rey is a Jedi I guess because\\, well\\, she is just that cool.  The list is long on things wrong with this movie.  The Force Awakens\\, as much as it copied the elements from the previous movies\\, was a fun space adventure that made you excited for the future.  This one destroys all that by not answering any of the questions set by the first.  Did the writer even read the first screenplay before writing the follow up?  It's a sloppy sequel that tried to create to much of it's own message without simply following the arcs of the Force Awakens.  The main characters in TLJ have no character arc.  Rey\\, the main character of this trilogy\\, still has no arc what-so-ever.  The brilliance of A New Hope was that Lucas set up Luke's journey - \\\"I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi like my father.\\\"  (which makes the brilliant reveal of Darth Vader in Empire that much more powerful)  Rey gets none of that through two movies now!  What is her journey?  She's the main character and we still don't know.  Much of the bad reviews by the \\\"audience\\\" members lay out more of the reasons why this movie fails\\, and we that hate it can probably go on and on.  But in my opinion\\, it's a waste of a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
