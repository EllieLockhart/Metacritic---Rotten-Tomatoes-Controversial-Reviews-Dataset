Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan since my Dad popped in \\\"A New Hope\\\" into the VCR. As I continued to grow\\, so did my love for the universe. Lightsaber duels in Walmart with my friends\\, getting lost in the marvel that was Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox... but it seems time to let go of the fandom. \\n\\nI felt no connection to the force while watching this movie. I wish that I had felt joy\\, anger or even disgust... but instead I felt nothing. This was the last Star Wars movie I'll be seeing in theaters. Into exile I must go.","true":true}
