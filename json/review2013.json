Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As someone that loves Star Wars as a whole I was quite shocked with how boring and slow this movie was. There was about 5-6 different \\\"fake out endings\\\" with redundant scenes and wasted potential. This is the last nail in the coffin for me to give up on any upcoming Star Wars films. If I wanted to watch Star Wars Episode 5 I'd go watch it not watch some bad remake","true":true}
