Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having JJ Abrams write a story and then turning to Rian Johnson to fill in and write his own story and then giving the direction of story back to JJ Abrams to finish the triology is  a terrible idea. Last Jedi destroyed fan favorite Luke Skywalker's character for all those who waited decades for his character to reappear. It was heartbreaking especially if you wanted to see him actually use his lightsaber to go against some first order. \\n\\nThe dumb plot of losing fuel. What was pointless was the leader of the rebels not telling her whole crew what she was doing ... didn't make sense ... trying to add unnecessary suspense....thus causing an unnecessary mutiny. \\n\\nSnoke was a pointless character because of this film ... whatever JJ Abrams was trying to do w\/ the intrigue Snoke and his background was rendered pointless by the Last Jedi director\/writer Rian Johnson.\\n\\nThe lightsaber scene between Rey and Ben was cool and unique.\\n\\nI enjoyed Force Awaken but I really disdain Last Jedi.
