Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I just waited until dvd\\, maybe I'd give it 2 1\/2 stars ... But really it was not an enjoyable experience to waste 2 & 1\/2 hrs of my life watching nonsense. This movie bored me\\, annoyed me & basically just felt pointless. It was a jumbled up mess. How can a movie this big not understand the basic fundamental elements of storytelling...it's baffling. . Oh & this movie really really likes to open doors... That just lead to nowhere & nothing. Like I said at the beginning- a lot of pointless nonsense. ","true":true}
