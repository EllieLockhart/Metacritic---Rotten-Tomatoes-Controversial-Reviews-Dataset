Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is no stranger to writing a series' greatest episodes. In 2012 he Broke Bad with Walter White and\\, in 2017\\, he did it again with a fresh vision for the Force. Like any Star Wars\\, there's something for everyone - but this time it's a good thing.","true":true}
