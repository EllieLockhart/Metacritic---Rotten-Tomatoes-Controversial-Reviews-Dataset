Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson should hang his head in shame for destroying the Star Wars franchise. Terrible over scripted attempts at comedy that don't even come close to working\\, a weak plot with more holes than Swiss cheese\\, zero depth and worst of all\\, the complete and utter waste of so many epic characters stories. Has he ever seen a Star Wars Film? Did he know there are 7 movies prior to this one? It makes Attack of the Clones look good and the inclusion of Jar Jar Binks would have significantly improved the Film\\, it's that poor!","true":true}
