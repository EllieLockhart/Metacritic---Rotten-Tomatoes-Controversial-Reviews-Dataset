Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has broken my husband. I keep catching him staring into the middle distance sighing to himself or occasionally muttering \\\"Oh Luke... why.

And then with tears in his eyes explaining that Luke would never resemble the weirdo in The Last Jedi. He has then had to explain to our daughters that Rey is a terrible role model - a girl who doesn't have to work to achieve anything.\\n\\nI've been instructed that we are not to buy any further Star Wars merchandise (this from a man who loves having lightsaber battles with our young son).\\n\\nHonestly\\, what have you done to my husband?!","true":true}
