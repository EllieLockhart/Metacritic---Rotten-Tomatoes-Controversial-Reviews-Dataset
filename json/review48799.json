Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst movie to exist in Star Wars theatrical history. The first third of the movie was utter nonsense\\, the core of the movie undermines one of the greatest heroes of the last 30 years in an elaborate character assassination. The new characters are pointless distractions that ultimately achieve nothing that couldn't have been done more effectively without them\\, and the characters returning from episode 7 spend more time running in circles than anything else. Every promising story arc from episode 7 is promptly dropped in as anticlimactic a fashion as possible. Bottom line\\, if you're looking for a Star Wars story that subverts your expectations while also having a female lead\\, you're better off with Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords.","true":true}
