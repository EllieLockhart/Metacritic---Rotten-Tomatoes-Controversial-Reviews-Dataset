Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a whole heartedly good movie and on top of that an excellent Star Wars film. Since I went and saw The Last Jedi I've been reading bad reviews and seen many YouTube videos that state that this film was complete rubbish\\, to which I ask did we see different movies? The Last Jedi wasn't perfect\\, I will concede that but what film ever is? Many people were unhappy it was different from what the trailers for it showed but isn't that a good thing? You go to the movies expecting it to go one way and yet it's a different path\\, I found that to be quite delightful. Now maybe this is all because I'm a fan of the original trilogy (unaltered) and maybe I have a better expectation than others\\, who knows. But I give this five stars for the reason that this felt like a Star Wars film\\, it wasn't perfect\\, it had problems\\, and not everyone will like it I've come to accept that. But what I did was make me happy. It took me to that galaxy far far away and showed that plans don't always work\\, sometimes the people who we think are hero's are just people they make mistakes\\, and the world (or galaxy) is not perfect but it's worth fighting to make it better. That is what I saw was not a perfectly polished universe but one where it and the people and creatures in it have seen some shit. All in all this was a worthwhile film to go see.\\n Long live the Resistance and may the force be with you\\, always.","true":true}
