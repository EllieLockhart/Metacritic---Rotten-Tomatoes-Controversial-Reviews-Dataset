Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm tired of Last Jedi defenders and Lucasfilm employees saying that people that didn't like this movie are racists\\, misogynists\\, and now RUSSIAN BOTS!  Are you serious?!  I'm sick of these nonsensical attacks on the fans that it actually drove me to create a rottentomatoes account so I could add my rating.  I will admit\\, this was a beautiful looking film.  I've rewatched it just for the visuals alone.  Unfortunately the story can't hold up.  I would much rather watch fan fiction by the guy next door than this.  It's clearly pushing political ideology at the expense of a good story.  Don't cite to me that Star Wars has always been political (Vietnam\\, Bush administration etc)... I know.  It was never this overt and agendas weren't shoved down your throat like this in the OT and PT.  This movie is a cynical mess\\, that ruins 40 years of mythology and shattered the fandom.  This movie has done so much damage to the Star Wars fandom and I don't know if it will recover.  Thankfully Solo got me back on the Star Wars bandwagon (GREAT MOVIE).  The promise of The Force Awakens was squandered here.","true":true}
