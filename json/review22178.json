Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kylo Ren repeatedly states he's destroying the past. Well\\,  clearly destroying any opportunities to give satisfying answers to questions raised in Force Awakens is a part of that edict.   What will Luke say to Rey?\\,Who is Snoke?\\, Who are Rey's parents?\\, Why is Rey seeing visions?\\, Why did Kylo kill Han?\\, Who are the Knights of Ren?  etc...  \\nSeveral of the characters weren't really developed or given the enough to do.  The relationships are now a bit muddled. This could not have been the original intent of ideas from Force Awakens.\\nVisually the movie looks great.  But the setting is still the same. There are several very strong\\, fun\\, and exciting moments. The heroes are trying to stop another \\\"big gun\\\"(ie. Death Stars).  In this movie there were three \\\"big guns\\\"\\, one for each act. \\nIn Short\\, it didn't live up to my expectations.  And unfortunately my expectations keep getting lowered. \\n\\nps.\\nWhy do bombers fly so slow in space?","true":true}
