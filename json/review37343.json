Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot was terrible\\, choreography and imagery rubbish. Fails as both a standalone film\\, and as path 2 of a 3 part series.\\n\\nCharacters are ruined or wasted\\, the original films are ruined and the entire work lacks what makes a star wars film.\\n\\nThis terrible film did the impossible\\, and became worse than the phantom menace and the attack of the clones.","true":true}
