Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Andrew the liberal agenda that is Disney. I'm all for having a diverse cast (even tho Star Trek started it) but when it's shoved down your throats and it's there because it is\\, causes the franchise to suffer.","true":true}
