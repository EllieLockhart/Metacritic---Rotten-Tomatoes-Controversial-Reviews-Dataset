Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Messy\\, contrived\\, and full of plot holes.  This is a visual orgy for the masses but cannot deliver a coherent story.  Nothing from the Force Awakens was answered\\, and in fact a lot of the cliff hangers that left us wanting to see TLJ were not even touched upon.  Travesty of a movie and I really want a refund.","true":true}
