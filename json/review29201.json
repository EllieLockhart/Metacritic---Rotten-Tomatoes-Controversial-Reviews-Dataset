Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remeber all those great classic characters you loved? They ruined them. Honestly worse than the prequels. At least with the prequels you can laugh at how bad they are\\, with this movie\\, you cry.","true":true}
