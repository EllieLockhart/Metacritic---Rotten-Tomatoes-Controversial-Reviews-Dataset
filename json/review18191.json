Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was much better than Force Awakens. It does a better job of giving subtle throwbacks to previous Star Wars movies.\\n\\nI also like that it is more open ended. I'm more excited about the next movie because I have no idea what they are planning.","true":true}
