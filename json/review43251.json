Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a bad movie. It's my opinion only\\, but I remember the feeling of exhilaration when I watched episode 4 as an 11yr old. The Force Awakens rekindled much of the vibe of the original movie and set us up for more. Rian Johnson made a pigs breakfast of The Last jedi\\, The thing that confuses me most is the disparity between the critics review and the audience score. I'm counting on JJ to rescue the brand\\, and give it back to the fans.","true":true}
