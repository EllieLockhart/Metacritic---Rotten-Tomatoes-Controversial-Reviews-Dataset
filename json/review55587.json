Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not bad. But not up to the cut either. Story is unnecessarily lengthy without anything substantial to work for an extra hour!! . Worst part- Some fools forgot many of us Star War fans had been waiting since 1985 for Luke Skywalker to wield his force in an epic showdown against the dark side. Alas! such a poor ending. Such a sidelining of the essential pivot of the tale. Was someone too busy trying to make things appeasing for those who ( young generation) boarded the bus late??  Also was the director too busy trying to highlight social stratas? That's not nice. Make an art film if you have to serve a cause.","true":true}
