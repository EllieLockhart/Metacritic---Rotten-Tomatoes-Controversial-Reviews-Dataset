Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the second best Star Wars behind The Empire Strikes Back. The character development was at an all-time best in this film. Each story arc was interesting and kept you on the edge of your set. The humor seemed off in a few places\\, but still got a chuckle from the audience. This film doesn't rely on a huge amount of action or exposition like The Force Awakens did\\, and unfortunately\\, folks are going into the Last Jedi expecting that again; it simply isn't so. This one contains numerous nuances that might require a second viewing to catch. Visually\\, this film is gorgeous\\, and\\, as I see it\\, the most visually pleasing and beautiful film in the saga. Don't allow the negative\\, simple minded reviews steer you from this masterpiece of a film.","true":true}
