Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest slap in the face they could have give to the truly fans of Star Wars. This is the biggest disappointment of my life\\, and it's hard to believe that there's people who call themselves fans claiming it was great\\, or even good.\\nThis is and insult to the force\\, to the universe\\, to Mark Hamill\\, to Harrison Ford\\, to Carrie Fisher\\, to George Lucas\\, to the whole industry. \\nI won't ever see a Star Wars movie ever again until they fire R\u00edan Thomson and that crazy feminist bitch who says the Force is female","true":true}
