{"101487":138031,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In general\\, I did not like this movie and I just feel like it murdered the potential of this new trilogy. I wasn't pleased with The Force Awakens\\, which in my opinion was simply a remake of A New Hope\\, but I was utterly disappointed with the path that The Last Jedi threw the Star Wars franchise onto. Some of the things I hated:\\n1) Unnecessary\\, even forced humour. I think the highlight of this is the call between Hux and Poe... Extremely cringeworthy. I can't remember any particularly funny moment.\\n2) Luke throwing the lightsaber away. That\\, to me\\, is a crystal clear example of forced humour. Yes\\, it will give you a cheap laugh as it is something unexpected\\, but it completely doesn't fit into the whole context of the scene. That lightsaber belonged to Luke's father\\, it was given to him by Obi-Wan\\, it was used by him during his first encounter with his father... It's not just any random lightsaber. Luke would have never threw it away like that\\, regardless of all the bitterness with which he perceives the Jedi Order and its legacy (despite being conflicted on this issue).\\n3) Snoke getting sliced in two... The way he's presented is as an extremely powerful villain\\, and it's just straight up disappointing to see him getting killed off like that without even getting any more exposition about who he is and how he came to command the First Order. The only positive thing I can say here\\, though\\, is that Kylo's use of the Force in this case actually resembles more of what we imagine in our heads (i.e. oh why not just use the Force to make someone's lightsaber to turn on\\, cutting their leg off). I do\\, however\\, have a theory that Snoke is not dead (similar to how Luke didn't die when Kylo sliced him)\\, which would make a reconciliation between Rey and Kylo possible in IX.\\n4) Rey's parents - that was a super disappointment. Assuming\\, that is\\, that what Kylo told Rey is true. It's not like I'm expecting the \\\"I am your father\\\" reveal\\, but I don't think having Rey just be a commoner would make the new trilogy interesting. Having said that\\, I hope Kylo was just screwing around with her.\\n5) Leia flying through space like Mary Poppins. I won't elaborate\\, it was just plain nonsense.\\n6) The sidequest story where Fin and Rose go to a gambling hideout to find a codebreaker\\, which just draws our attention away from the main storyline for no reason. What is more saddening is how useless the character of the codebreaker was.","true":true}
