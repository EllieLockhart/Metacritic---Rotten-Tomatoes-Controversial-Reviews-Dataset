Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"unbelievable how bad it was. I wanted to like it. I even bought the blu ray steel disks but it truly is unwatchable. I tried to watch it 3 times and finally gave up. the story is just not good. I dont know what the critics where thinking. none of the reviews match what I watched!? thanks for helping me waste my money.","true":true}
