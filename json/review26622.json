Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay seriously\\, this movie is good. I really enjoyed it\\, the only thing I would have a problem with is the Finn and Rose storyline. Go watch the movie and you\u2019ll enjoy it. It\u2019s something new and different that\\, obviously\\, not everyone can handle.","true":true}
