Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing is so shallow. Kylo Ren got the best writing\\, and Adam Driver delivered a great performance\\, but it was pretty clear that was all the movie was concerned with. The amount of unfunny humor and of good dialogue opportunities being sacrificed in favor or pseudowitty\\, snarky one liners was really too much. Apparently the writers forgot that Finn has a background. Rey felt like a side character in her own movie. A boring\\, disappointing movie.","true":true}
