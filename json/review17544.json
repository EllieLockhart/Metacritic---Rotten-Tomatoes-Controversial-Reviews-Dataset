Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up just to review this since apparently no one believes all of these negative reviews. \\nThe good - the cinematography (an incredibly beautiful film with some jaw-dropping shots)\\nthe acting - Hamill and Driver stole the show\\, but there really were no weak links\\nthe humor - I actually enjoyed most of it\\, thought it was in line with the original trilogy\\nthe bad - everything else\\, especially the plot. Instead of allowing the story to naturally lead where it should go\\, the old characters were abruptly pushed out to put the focus on the new characters. But these new characters were sent in different directions and haven't been allowed to develop any interaction or chemistry with each other - that's what made the original trilogy so great\\, the relationships between Luke\\, Leia & Han. By Return of the Jedi they were old friends\\, helping and playing off each other. And Rey\\, who was so compelling in Force Awakens\\, is now a two-dimensional Mary Sue looking for a boyfriend. The Rey\/Kylo storyline didn't work for me - he's an immature\\, selfish murderer - why would Rey be interested in that? \\nAnyway\\, I'm glad I saw it for certain scenes\\, especially those at the end\\, but I won't be in any hurry to see episode 9 because I'm just not that interested in finding out what happens to the remaining characters.","true":true}
