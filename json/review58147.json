Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow I made this account just to make this review. Im dumbfounded  I can't believe how much they ruined Star Wars and made a complete joke out of it\\, you can tell buy Mark Hamill's facial expression at the end of the premire even he thinks wtf. There are so many things wrong with this film\\, some scenes are just utter disrespect to the ideas on what Star Wars was built on. After this film they really killed the specialness of it coming back. TFA wasn't perfect but they could have built on it\\, with this film I was so disappointed and honestly felt trolled if I could leave 0 stars I would.","true":true}
