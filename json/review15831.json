Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars\\, Empire and Jedi because they communicated a universal story in an incredible universe. That story tight\\, economically told\\, and had a sense of inevitability. The Last Jedi takes place in the same universe\\, and beyond that\\, is the exact opposite. I am glad to see women and as diverse a cast as possible in this or any film. The problem I have with this film is that it is deeply boring\\, and that is because it lacks a strong story and strong characters. Strong is a vague word - but fundamentally\\, the success of the original films was anchored in believability and emotion.","true":true}
