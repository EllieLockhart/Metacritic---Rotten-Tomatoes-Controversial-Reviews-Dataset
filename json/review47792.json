Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I begin? If not for Mark Hamill's performance then i would of given this an even worse review.  I'm glad that he was finally able to save face and show people that he can act.  SPOILER AHEAD\\n\\nSeriously\\, since when can people float in space and not die? \\nWhy did Rose get such a big part? No one cares about her\\nFinn... who cares\\nPo... should of been killed for treason... twice\\nSNOOK? LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \\n\\nI can go on and on but the fact is this.... they made everything that happened in episode 7 pointless.  \\n\\nA long time ago\\, in a galaxy far\\, far away\\, Star Wars movies used to be good.\\nThey featured interesting characters doing cool stuff - flying spaceships\\, shooting laser guns\\, rescuing princesses from evil space knights.\\nToday\\, under the rule of the Disney Social Justice Empire\\, Star Wars movies feature boring characters standing around giving cringe-worthy motivational speeches and crying.\\n\\nI am done with Disney's \\\"Star Wars\\\" I hope to erase it from my memory in some deep sessions with my pysciatrist","true":true}
