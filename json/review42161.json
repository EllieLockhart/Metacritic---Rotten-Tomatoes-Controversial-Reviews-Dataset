Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined the franchise. The story line was weak\\, and there was a lot of material that didn't contribute to the story in a significant way. A lot of the conversations felt forced to me. Just disappointed overall. I hope the next film can right all of the wrongs done in this one.","true":true}
