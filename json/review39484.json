Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film serves as a study in how to destroy a seemingly indestructible franchise.  Give the woke far left a franchise\\, let them create a Mary Sue that is one dimensional\\, has no character flaws\\, and someone you can't relate to\\, then take a steaming dump on the most iconic character in cinema.  Viola\\, you killed a franchise. ","true":true}
