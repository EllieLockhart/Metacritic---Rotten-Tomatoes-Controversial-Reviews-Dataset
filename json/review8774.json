Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Force...\\\"\\, \\\"balance...\\\" - repeats Luke to his new apprentice with all of this Star Wars pathos.\\n\\nAre you serious?\\n\\nI can see Disney's devilish smile while taking money from this enormously overestimated series\\, turned into a bland soap-opera without any philosophy and emotional connections. It's a shame that Princess Leia got such messy and lukewarm goodbye which \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is. It seems that no one really cared about origins of force\\, just trying to get rid of all the old characters instead (while still making money mostly for having the actors from original trilogy). But the most irritating thing is that the new ground and all the new characters have nothing new to add or explain.","true":true}
