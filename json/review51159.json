Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely incredible. It does things you wouldn't normally like\\, and proposes ideas that seem ridiculous\\, but it pulls them off in the best possible ways\\, and forces you to like it. John William's soundtrack is incredible as always\\, especially the tracks \\\"Chrome Dome\\\" and \\\"Sacred Jedi Texts\\\". The acting in this movie is incredible. Adam Driver\\, Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Domnall Gleeson steal the show\\, however. They're truly incredible. The story is very good. (Spoiler Warning) I personally don't like the choices of Rey-Random and No-Backstory-Snoke\\, but I understand why it had to be this way. I truly cannot wait for Episode IX\\, and I can't understand why the movie is getting bad audience reviews!","true":true}
