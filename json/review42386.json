Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolute garbage. I love most of the other films. A prank call to the Admiral of thEmpire!?! ?  Having Leia pull a space jam from outer space. A million plot holes. It didn't feel like a StarWars movie. I felt like Harry Potter or a Marvel superhero was gonna come out for some more cheesy humor.  The way they handles Luke and Leia was a atrocious","true":true}
