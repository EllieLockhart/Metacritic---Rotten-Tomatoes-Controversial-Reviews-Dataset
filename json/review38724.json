Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing was forced. It was out of character. It was like I was watching a Marvel comics movie. Fun to watch but not memorable. It seems that Rian Johnson did not see The Force Awakens. Way too many sub plots. I will always be a fan but this let me down. ","true":true}
