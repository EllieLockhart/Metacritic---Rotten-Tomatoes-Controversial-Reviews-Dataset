Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trying to be to introspective and deep and go left knowing many fans wanted them to go right hurt this movie for me.  I will watch it again and see how it feels the second time around.  But trying to be cute and different  hurt this movie.","true":true}
