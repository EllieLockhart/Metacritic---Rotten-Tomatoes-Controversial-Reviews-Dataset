Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a deep lore Star Wars fan\\, this is not the movie for you. If you are a general fan to just before deep lore\\, this is a movie you will tolerate. If you are a Disney and or casual Star Wars Fan\\, this is a movie you will like. If this is the first one for you\\, you are going to definitely enjoy parts of it well.\\nAs a fairly deep fan\\, I saw the movie in in 3 parts: The first gave me a feeling that Disney was flaunting the fact that they own Star Wars\\, and us as fans need to just deal with it and \\\"Let the past die. Even if you have to kill it.\\\" \\nThe second part of the movie did not feel completely like a Star Wars movie. I could definitely see that there was some beliefs that maybe had a hit back at our reality that challenged the political machine. It was good\\, but it seemed like it belonged in another movie. \\nThe third part\\, which was about the last hour to 75 minutes of the movie was a true fire Star Wars movie that by itself could have sat above all other Star Wars movies that have come before it. \\nYou will get the feeling of a good light-hearted\\, \\\"kid friendly\\,\\\" laugh fest through a good portion of the movie. It will then turn into a thought provoking fun\\, Disney style movie that will keep the kids engaged and bring the adult watchers back from the point of annoyance with the over the top attempt to replace the \\\"Han humor.\\\" The ride really begins in the middle here until the most visually stunning scene I have ever seen in any movie that I have watched in recent years\\, and then your breath is taken away for a minute. You are going to find\\, especially if you watched \\\"The Force Awakens\\,\\\" that there are a couple of characters that just did not make sense in the movie\\, and I would love to have a sit down with the director to learn why they were that way. It is mostly because of what I felt was a middle finger from Disney to the fans\\, the horrendous mis-use of a couple of characters\\, and some questionable dialogue in the middle Act that I did not give this the 5th star. If the whole movie was like the \\\"Scene of silence\\\" and the end of the film\\, this would replace \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" my view of the best Star Wars Movie.","true":true}
