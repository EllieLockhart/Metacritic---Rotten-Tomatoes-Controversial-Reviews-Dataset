Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terribleness! I am no Star Wars geek but I love Star Wars. You can take all of the parts that I enjoyed about this movie and condense it into 10 minutes at a push. To long\\, to boring. I will show my kids the original 3\\, hand them the toys and let them make the rest up for themselves.","true":true}
