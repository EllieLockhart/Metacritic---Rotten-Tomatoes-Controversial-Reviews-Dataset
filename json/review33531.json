Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible! Every Male figure is a Loser\\, weak\\, and stupid. Only Women can save the galaxy.  male shaming!  Feels very clearly like social and political propaganda rather then a good movie about the star wars universe and deep human valves and true conflicts.  Another example\\, If you're rich you're are evil. More of a forced agenda\\, rather than a human story.  Can't relate to the stupid choices made by the characters and the director\\, simply unbelievable - meaning BAD story telling skills.  It was not immersing\\, because it was not believable on so many levels (Jedi order ideals betrayed\\, physics faults\\, forced characters (Kylo was well acted though.)  Disney has killed Star Wars\\, by pushing social engineering rather than a human story.  Watch Lord of Rings films\\, if you want good story telling. and then compare it to this garage.  So sad. What a waste.  I agree with Mark Hamill\\, and Harrison Ford\\,  can't recapture lighting in a bottle\\, to paraphrase\\, \\\"Kill off my character please\\, because this film franchise now sucks.\\\"  Critics must have been bought!!!!!!!","true":true}
