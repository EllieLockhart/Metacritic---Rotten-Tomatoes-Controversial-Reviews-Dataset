Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not only a terribly poor Star Wars film\\, it was a bad film in general. Ridiculous plot holes! Poor character development. Cringe worthy comedy\\, completely ruined the the carefully crafted mysteries and build up\\, J.J Abrams worked on in force awakens. An absolute shambles of a movie\\, wish I could unsee it and get my money back.","true":true}
