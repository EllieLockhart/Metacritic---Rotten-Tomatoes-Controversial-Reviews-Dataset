Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are at least two fundamental mistakes to my opinion\\, which make no sense: (Spoilers ahead).\\n\\nFirst of all\\, if force ghosts were really able to physically interact with the living world (now Yoda uses the force to cause a thunderbolt)\\, then there would be no star \\\"wars\\\". Bunch of jedi force ghosts would be enough to eliminate imperial army (vice versa for sith). end of story.\\n\\nSecondly\\, if smaller ships were able to eliminate huge imperial ships with a hyperspace jump (as Holdo did) then actually\\, it would be enough to just build cheap suicide ships to take out imperial fleet...\\n\\nOther than that\\, it wouldn't really hurt creative writing if the beloved characters would come together just once to make the old fans nostalgic and happy. This is not just another movie...\\n\\nI understand what the director tried\\, and it was possibly the right way to go. But the story should have made sense.","true":true}
