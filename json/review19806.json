Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was as if the director didn't know anything about the characters. Luke Skywalker never would have thrown the lightsaber over his shoulder\\, and he sure as hell would not have given up on Ben Solo that easily. The horrible character development\\, it was as if the director didn't even read anything about what was built up until this point. You can skip this movie and the Skywalker saga increases ten fold. Its not about \\\"catering to fans\\\" its about the director not knowing anything about this universe.","true":true}
