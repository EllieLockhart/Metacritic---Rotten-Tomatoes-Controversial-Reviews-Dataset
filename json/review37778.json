Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a few things that took me out of the movie\\, but after being emotionally wrecked by Rogue One\\, TLJ was very much welcomed. I don't know if it deserves a 91% by critics\\, but I feel that some people reviewing are being unnecessarily dramatic. It is not the best in the series\\, but it is not the worst (bruh\\, did you even see episode 1?). I found it thoroughly entertaining to watch and I was engaged the entire time. There are many things I wished could be different\\, but at the same time the series is by no means ruined.","true":true}
