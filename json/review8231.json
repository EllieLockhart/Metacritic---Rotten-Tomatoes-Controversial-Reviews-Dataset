Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic Star Wars movie. The force is once again a powerful and mysterious power. The character development reminds you of the human emotions that dwell within even those with extra worldly powers. The visuals are out of this Galaxy and the sound effects are masterful. I spent the whole time smiling and inbawe of the great story that was told and left with thought provoking questions and anticipation for the next installment.","true":true}
