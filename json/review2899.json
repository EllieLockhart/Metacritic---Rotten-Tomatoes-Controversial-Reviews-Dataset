Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful writing. A few cool visuals peppered in. Definitely not boring as I was at the edge of my seat yelling at the characters for being so stupid. Perhaps Johnson was being meta when Kylo said \\\"Let the past die...\\\" and it is a sort of confession to trying to kill the Star Wars IP.","true":true}
