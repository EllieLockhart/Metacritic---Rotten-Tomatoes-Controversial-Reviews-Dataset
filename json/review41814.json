Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is so bad I will never buy it on dvd. The story is poor the political views shoved into a script that destroyed and ruined Luke and Fin and Poe. It felt like they took parts from the original film and squashed them together in the hope it would work. WRONG..... canto bite is so poor and makes no difference to the plot I'm sure it's a joke played on us all and mr Johnson is laughing in his SJW dark bubble wondering how he got away with this hatchet job. I've returned my DVD and got a full refund this will never get into my Star Wars collection.","true":true}
