Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without giving away any spoiler\\, this movie has lots of pointless side stories and useless scenes. Very different approach from where TFA left off. If you get all the relevant scenes that actually add anything to the plot the film would probably have around 40 minutes. They even managed to make General Organa irrelevant (like Phasma\\, Finn\\, Hux\\, Snoke... and Poe is a trigger happy jerk).","true":true}
