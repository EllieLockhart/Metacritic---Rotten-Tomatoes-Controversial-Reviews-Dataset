Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks for making me wait 2 years for absolutely nothing to happen. Really fucked over JJ twice. How's he gonna dig himself outta this weird hole. Rian you spell your name like a joke and make movies like a joke.","true":true}
