Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a rushed irrelevant piece of trash that was an insult to star wars fans\\, the previous movie\\, and most off the character Luke Skywalker not to mention it mocks all we have ever knew of \\\"the force\\\". I hate this movie and because of it star wars is now dead to me and so is Disney!","true":true}
