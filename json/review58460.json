Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the haters can go to hell\\, this film was great! Better than The Force Awakens. Trump supporters are offended because women and minorities have equal screen time as the white males in the film. Boohoo\\, sorry you're offended\\, that's real life. They want this to be a white male-centered film with a pretty girl and token black guy as supporting cast only. There is nothing wrong with diversity and strong female leads. If you need to push women down so you can feel better about your manhood\\, you're a pathetic pile of sh*t.","true":true}
