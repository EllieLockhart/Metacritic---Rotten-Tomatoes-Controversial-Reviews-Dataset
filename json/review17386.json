Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it on opening night on Wed (France) and I loved it. Aesthetically it was very pretty and cool. Crait especially is very interesting visually. Psychologically the themes were super interesting\\, the characters were moving. Everyone learned things\\, and I went from tense to awed to sad to happy every five minutes. It was a really good movie. It went places. It will definitely not be a movie you can be neutral about - either you hate it\\, or you love it.","true":true}
