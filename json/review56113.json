Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So the wait is over & I watched the start wars last jedi! Where do I start from\\, I liked the movie there is no doubt\\, I am very clear about what I loved in it! Star wars kept its heritage of a great story line.Just a few things that I could have wanted differently! \\nThe story line between Ray\/ken and luke was dark\\, twisted and real at the same time\\, their chemistry was just so genuine. Loved the delicate balance of light & dark between Rey & Kylo\\, how they were conflicted & what it meant for them\\, just pure gold!\\, loved how they expanded on the power of the force (don't want to say much without giving out a spoiler) however must say everything that happened in Snoke's command room between Rey\/kylo & Snoke the dialogues\\, story\\, action was brilliant!!  This brings me to the point that would have loved to see more Jedi action in the movie also Fin & Rey could have gotten more scenes together they were great in the last movie\\, Fins side story seemed like a filler that could have been shortened\\, glad to see Poe get good screen time with a nice story arc\\nNoteworthy part where Kylo uses the force to strangle ...great homage to Vader! In fact there were quite a few similarities between the previous episodes\\, they went full circle!\\nOh and yes have to mention one thing I have mixed feelings about the humor\\, as long it was Finn or one of the rebels involved in it all was good play but I could not digest the humor when it came from Strokes commander\\, any one linked to the Empire are dark\\, formidable villains\\, extreme disciplinarians so it was really weird seeing them in a clumsy scenes or engage in a dialogue that made the audience laugh.","true":true}
