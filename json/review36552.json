Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had a poorly written story\\, no character development\\, and plot holes everywhere. I do not like that all the female characters were perfect and all the male characters were flawed in some way. Making all the men in the movie stupid\\, cowardly\\, and incompetent is not the way to empower the women. Furthermore\\, as a woman\\, I am offended to be told I cannot identify with Luke Skywalker. I should be able to idolize Luke if I want to. It's great to have more female and minority characters in Star Wars. But do the characters justice by making them believable\\, relatable\\, and well written. This movie was such a disappointment.","true":true}
