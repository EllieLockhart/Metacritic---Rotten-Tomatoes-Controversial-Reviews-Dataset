Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge marvel-style humor fan and a self-identifying SJW (where the hell was the alien representation?)\\, I obviously have some different views than some of the negative ratings. I nonetheless agree with the majority of the commentary\\, and believe like most of the audience that critics don't know what the hell they are talking about and this was by far the worst star wars movie. In summary\\, fuck you\\, Disney. While the media goes crazy about the next episode\\, I'll be at home watching Star Trek.","true":true}
