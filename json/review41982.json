Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie left me with more questions than answers. There are a few good scenes. I was not impressed by the smaller story lines. Episode 7 hyped up a lot of characters and story lines that episode 8 did not follow through with. So much wasted potential.","true":true}
