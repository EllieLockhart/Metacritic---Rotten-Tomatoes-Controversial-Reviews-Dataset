Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An entertaining continuation of the franchise... Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher\\, in her final performance\\, shine here as do Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Some of the subplots don't really go anywhere and the character played by Benicio Del Toro is a bit of a misfire.. Still there is enough to entertain the fans and its still a fun film.","true":true}
