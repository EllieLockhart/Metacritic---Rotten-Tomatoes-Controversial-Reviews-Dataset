Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"pacing seemed off\\, very eclectic story line felt like to many char's vying for screen time which in the end left all of them lacking. the humour felt forced and at some points was inappropriate for the setting. over all i found it the worst of the franchise to date.","true":true}
