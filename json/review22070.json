{"101487":148810,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy revenge porn.\\nRian Johnson is the Lee Harvey Oswald of the 21st century\\, nothing more than a patsy. It's like Kennedy walked into the local hipster cafe and asked the guy with the biggest scarf and foamiest latte if he wants to write and direct a SW film. By bringing on said gimp\\, she could then wield Power over this film\\, pushing her agenda and exacting revenge for all the times men didn't listen to\\, or even deigned to question\\, her militant feminist ideas.\\n As usual\\, men have an issue because she's a woman with power\\, or the male ego\\, or perhaps she didn't get a big enough raise\\, or someone wolf-whistled at her fourteen years ago\\, or whatever first-world\\, champagne liberal issue it is this week. Of course it isn't because her ideas and film-making abilities are terrible\\, it's all down to men and their nefarious ways\\, as is portrayed throughout this insipid movie.\\nThe only people who rate this movie higher than one star are idiots like my brother who just like to annoy people by playing devil's advocate throughout their entire lives\\, what a joy these types are.\\nThis is just another movie (like recent Bond and Trek) that sells-out in order to appeal to as many demographics as possible\\, and only manages to appeal to the moronic Snapchat crowd for a half hour.\\nYou can hear the conversation; \\\"well the fans will go regardless\\, but how do we get everyone to go? Then we can buy two yachts with the profits\\\".\\nWhat they fail to understand is that it's the fans who will see the film eight times\\, who will buy four versions of the same blu ray\\, who will buy the toys and video games\\, and who will gladly line up to do it all again the next time.\\nIt's business 101\\, make a quality product\\, and people will return\\, produce a piece of crap like this film\\, and sure\\, you may get us once\\, but not twice.\\nIt feels like every script now goes through the HR department prior to being approved\\, ensuring that everyone feels catered to\\, and the tone and themes are safe enough.\\nThere's zero doubt; Women can carry a film in this\\, and any genre\\, TFA\\, rogue one\\, even a franchise\\, alien\\, terminator\\, Hunger G\\, so the argument that having a powerful female lead is an issue with us guys is dead in the water\\, but it must be said\\, Daisy Ridley is the Tom cruise of females in Hollywood\\, look at me everyone! I'm acting! Look how intense and focused I can be!! Could she at least try a different emotion?\\nI didn't notice how bad the performances were until Benecio appeared\\, made them all look like amateurs\\, although I suspect the one-dimensional performances are probably explained by the fact that you wouldn't let Johnson direct traffic\\, on a one-way street\\, in rural Montana\\, in winter.\\nSomeone tell Adam Driver that no amount of time in the gym\\, or ridiculous scarring will ever make him any more intimidating than Wicket the Ewok\\, I want my Sith Lord to be destroying planets and banging porn stars (sorry trump fans)\\, not crying and facetiming\\, plus this guy got his break playing a character that was in a sexual relationship with Lena Dunham\\, and that's just unacceptable.\\nHow did our hero\\, Finn\\, (who of course is no longer a hero\\, in this film he's a deserter\\, and a coward) have such a bland and preposterously unattractive love interest? I looked that woman up\\, she's quite sexy\\, but of course they dress her up in a sack and make her look like Rosie O'Donnell\\, because women shouldn't be required to aspire\/confirm to the male idea of what is beautiful\\, and you don't have to be beautiful to get the hero\\, and that regardless of what we see on the outside\\, we are all equal\\, and looks don't matter\\, blah blah blah.\\nI'm on board\\, love everyone\\, give everyone a chance\\, don't judge a book\\, I totally agree\\, things like racism\\, abuse of power\\, and sexual assault make me sick\\, but for the love of our gender-less\\, mixed-race\\, questioning god\\, I find it quite insulting when you wrap a tofu patty in a lettuce leaf\\, coat it in dairy-free cheese and tell me it's a hamburger\\, and then try to shove it down my throat at every\\, single opportunity.\\nThe above is not even the worst part\\, not even close. This entire film was just Lazy\\, sloppy\\, disrespectful\\, cartoonish (those pathetic jokes)\\, and something that even the pedestrian prequels didn't achieve; extremely boring\\, as boring as the Winter Olympics - seriously\\, rich kids skiing down a hill\\, or prancing around on ice? Go away.\\nThe final straw for me is that Chewbacca\\, arguably the greatest sidekick in film history\\, a true legend of the SW universe\\, only functions as a chauffeur for Rey\\, and is possibly a vegan! Paleo yes\\, but a vegan? That's where I draw the line. Is there no end to this nightmare? This\\, and Johnson turning Luke into an effeminate\\, Prius driving\\, self-portrait\\, which is just the epitome of arrogance and self-indulgence. Luke was never John MacLaine\\, but I had to check if I was actually watching 'The Notebook' for a minute there.\\nI'm not hurt by the killing of the sacred cow\/s of the previous films\\, sure\\, go ahead\\, kill it\\, share it with everyone\\, make shoes out of it\\, start afresh\\, take it in another direction\\, but please\\, at least respect the cow\\, pay homage to it\\, get a priest to bless it\\, make it kosher\\, halal\\, have native elders perform a ceremony\\, whatever makes you comfortable\\, don't just throw it in the trash like it never mattered\\, like it never gave you anything\\, like it doesn't deserve even a burial ceremony\\, who do you think you are?\\n\\nOk\\, Star Wars died today\\, it's a sad time\\, but it's just a film\\, the real conspiracy here is the wide-ranging manipulation of the masses by companies like Disney. This is not a good film\\, in any sense\\, fan or not\\, it's not even worth 2 stars\\, it just isn't\\, how is the critic score in the 90th percentile? That's the legacy of this film\\, the film itself should be thrown in the trash\\, it no longer exists in my world\\, but what is painfully obvious is Disney and other companies influencing what the public see as 'impartial' or 'unbiased' public forums or services\\, just so they can make more money\\, but I guess that's all that matters now.","true":true}
