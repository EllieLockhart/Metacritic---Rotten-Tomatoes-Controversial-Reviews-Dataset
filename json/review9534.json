Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good effects? Absolutely... Good fights? A couple... The rest? A pretencious bunch of senseless scenes in a constant introduction to \\\"something\\\" that never the movie reaches. May be leaves some loose ends for episode IX\\, but very interesting characters such as Snoke\\, Finn\\, and Phasma were totally wasted. The powerful First order in hands of the fainthearted Hux and Kylo Ren? Unbelievable. There are an extreme abuse of childish Jokes\\, in the \\\"Pirates of the caribbean\\\" line... so \\\"Disney's\\\". \\nThe unexpected twists of the story are refreshing\\, but the entire movie never gets the deepness and darkness of more-developed characters\\, and falls into a very long nayvety.","true":true}
