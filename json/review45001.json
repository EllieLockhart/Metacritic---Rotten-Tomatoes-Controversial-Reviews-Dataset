Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Una completa decepci\u00f3n de pel\u00edcula. Desde el hecho de que no respetaran la continuidad que JJ ABRAMS hab\u00eda establecido (y que ya de por si tenia sus fallas) hasta la destrucci\u00f3n de las bases de lo que es una pel\u00edcula de Star Wars . Gracias Rian Johnson por darnos la peor entrega de la franquicia.","true":false}
