Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cheese and crackers\\, you goobers. You complain about TFA because it's too similar\\, then complain now that it's too different. I read one guy who said \\\"Even the prequel trilogy had HEART behind it.\\\" I just...what? What? Did we watch ANY of the same movies? Sorry you didn't get all your fanboy wish-fulfillment onscreen this time around\\, but that's not how this works. It's been said before and it's true - \\\"The only people who hate Star Wars are Star Wars fans.\\\" Breeeeeathe\\, just breeeeathe.","true":true}
