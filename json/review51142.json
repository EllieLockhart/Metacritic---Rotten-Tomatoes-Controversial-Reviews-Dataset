Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible movie. Have been a fan of Star Wars forever. The Force Awakins was garbage\\, I gave this a shot hoping they would learn from mistakes\\, but this was near the worst movie I've EVER seen. I won't even entertain another one...basically just ruined Star Wars for me completely\\, thanks Disney.","true":true}
