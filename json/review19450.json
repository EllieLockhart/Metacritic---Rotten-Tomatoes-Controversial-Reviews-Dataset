Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's terrible what Disney is doing to Star Wars. They turned George Lucas's epic imaginative space opera full of mythological\\, spiritual\\, psychological and political elements into a soulless generic movie about spaceships. Disney stomped on all the Star Wars themes like a herd of angry elephants. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi has no story\\, no character development\\, no substance\\, no meaning. It was like watching a SW parody: Spaceballs 2.","true":true}
