Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Long time star wars fan and this is not star wars. Such a wasted opportunity. Ladies would clap since women are the heroines in this movie and every guy makes bad decisions or bad jokes. You will still go watch it since the critics can't be wrong..\\, and then please come here and rate it so that there is a true rating of the fans.","true":true}
