Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loyal to its commercially successfull formula\\, the new Star Wars movie surprises noone with its over-the-top unrealistic sci-fi action\\, simplistic fantasy approach to the plot\\, ex machina obsessed direction and sadly its uninspired acting.","true":true}
