Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film tries to pick up off the high of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" but in its quest to break away from the old Star Wars series in search of its own originality\\, tries too hard to \\\"extinguish old flames\\\" and added several redundant scenes to perhaps sell merchandise.\\n\\nWhile it is an enjoyable ride with the Star Wars promise of space battles and lightsaber duels\\, it felt as though the movie had 30 minuntes of content and 2 hours of fillers to\\, as said above\\, sell merchandise (all the plushies and lego sets!) and to embark on \\\"a new journey of its own\\\".","true":true}
