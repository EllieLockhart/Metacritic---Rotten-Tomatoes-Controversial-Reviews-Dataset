Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pros:\\nGreat ideas and some truly breathtaking moments\\nGreat direction by RJ\\nHumorous \\nPoe Dameron & BB8\\nKylo Ren\\nKylo - Luke dynamic\\n\\nCons: \\nSome really bad ideas\\nNo sense of adventure\\nSterile like TFA\\nNo Star Wars charm\\nRose & Finn complete waste of screen time\\nNonexistent plot progression\\nTerrible CGI at times\\nTypical Disney crap - everyone is a diamond in the rough and special\\nNo impactful revelations\\nBrought nothing new to the table\\n30 min too long\\nFew scenes cringe-worthy\\n\\nVerdict: Really entertaining with some great if not amazing moments. However\\, Star Wars as we know it is dead and soon enough everyone will cry for George Lucas to come back. I feel sorry for the young generations. They deserve better. Gone is the magic and the vast world building. All the build up by TFA was never answered and the pay-off is more than underwhelming. After watching TFA I wanted to see more\\, I was curious\\, I needed answers. Walking out of this movie I felt depressed. To top all off\\, this new trilogy destroyed the old trilogy characters to the point of no return\\, such a shame. Comparing this movie to the greatness of Empire Strikes Back is a sin. Not looking forward to Episode 9\\, in fact I really don't care. As far as I'm concerned\\, Episode 1-6 are canon\\, this is not.","true":true}
