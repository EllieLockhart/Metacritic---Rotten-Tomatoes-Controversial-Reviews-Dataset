Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Giving it half a star because I can't do less. Garbage movie that killed what little plot there was from Force Awakens and treat the old fans and characters like garbage. May Rian Johnson die a horrible death.","true":true}
