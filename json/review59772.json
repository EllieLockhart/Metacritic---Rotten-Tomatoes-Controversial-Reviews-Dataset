Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Just created an account so I can make this review. Major story spoilers ahead.\r\rThe Last of Us Part 2 is a dumpster fire compared to it's predecessor.\r\r- Unceremoniously killed off Joel.\r\r- Dumping a truckload of backstory on Abby and forcing me to play as her doesn't make me feel sorry for her\\, or forgive her for what she did.\r\r- Ellie goes on a revenge mission\\, killing 100+ people on the way to get Abby. Then\\, out of nowhere\\, at the absolute last second\\, she decides\\, \\\"Actually\\, killing is bad\\\". And LETS HER GO. Seriously? That's what you came up with? Some pseudo philosophical message about how \\\"Revenge is bad\\\" Yet Abby can get hers and go on her merry way?\r\r- So much needless violence and edgyness\\, At times\\, it's like watching an 15 year old's murder fantasy. I get it\\, you want to be raw and emotional\\, but normal people don't act like this.\r\rOn the side note\\, it's very suspecious how this game got 9\/10s and 10\/10s by big gaming reviewers\\, despite universal backlash the day of it's release. How did this garbage get 95 and a \\\"Must Play\\\" award from Metacritic?\r\rSave your money. Maybe replay the first game\\, since they actually knew what they were doing there.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
