The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Don\u2019t listen to the beta male haters of this game. They made it their mission to review bomb a game that most of them didn\u2019t even play. They watched the spoilers and got butt hurt that Joel died. And their homophobic lgbtq nonsense just adds to their lack of any kind of meaningful insight to the game. That being said\\, this game is amazing. If you loved the first game and fully understood its themes\\, you\u2019ll love this game. It\u2019s beautifully done. Not only the graphics\\, music and gameplay\\, but also the story. This game will make you truly \u201cfeel\u201d what\u2019s going on inside these characters. I was fully ready to hate Abby for what she did to Joel. But after completing this game\\, I grew to understand why she did what she did. And although I wish I still would\u2019ve had the option to kill her\\, I understand why ND wrote the story in this way. Abby arguably lost more than Ellie ever did. Abbys story is essentially the same as Ellie\u2019s\\, just from her own perspective. Joel deserved to die. If you truly believe that Ellie deserved vengeance\\, than you can\u2019t logically think that Abby should\u2019ve been denied hers. Abby spent 4 years training for her mission to find Joel\\, and it shows in her physique. Much like an MMA fighter. Again\\, my only regret is not getting the option to kill Abby. Although ND made me empathize with her\\, I\u2019ll always be loyal first to Joel and Ellie.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
