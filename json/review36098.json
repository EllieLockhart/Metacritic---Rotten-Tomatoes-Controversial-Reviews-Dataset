Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a disgrace to the Star Wars saga. Questions were still unanswered\\, plot lines that were introduced in episode 7 were ignored\\, and the dialogue was horrendous (trying too hard to be funny). Disney took everything that was good about the Skywalker story line and just ruined it. The first half of the movie was slow going\\, after that it was a regurgitation of episodes 5 and 6\\, no new material. Severely disappointed and actually signed a petition to have this film removed from canon and Disney to remake it. Horrible.","true":true}
