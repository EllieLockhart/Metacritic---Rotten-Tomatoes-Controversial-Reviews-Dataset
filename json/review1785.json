Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars film it was visually spectacular and kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot for me was enjoyable even though there was a view plotholes I would have liked to have not seen. I would have liked Snoke to have more development for his character and more of an explanation to why the resistance escape plan wasn't discussed with Poe. I enjoyed the film however and people are getting mad because it isn't the film they expected to see.Overall\\, enjoyable\\, shocking\\, jaw dropping and visually amazing with a few errors. This takes Star Wars to a new direction and just because it isn't what some people want\\, doesn't mean it is bad.","true":true}
