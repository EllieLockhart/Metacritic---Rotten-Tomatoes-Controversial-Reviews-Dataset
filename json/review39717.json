Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a good movie with some major blunders. The visuals are\\, of course\\, amazing! As for the story\\, I loved everything with Rey and Luke\\, and the third act was quite enjoyable. However\\, I didn't care for the new character\\, and while Finn is my favorite from the last film\\, the side quest he goes on is rather uninteresting\\, and doesn't go anywhere. Also\\, Po needs more to do. Still\\, a very enjoyable film\\, mixing some rehash with great new elements!","true":true}
