Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome film!!! A bit bloated in the middle with a lengthy unnecessary plot\\, but everything else I loved. The cinematography is gorgeous\\, and the music some of the best in star wars. It subverted my expectations at every turn\\, and left me excited to see what's next. The humor was a bit too much\\, but it didn't hamper my enjoyment of it all. I love that they decided to try new things\\, and I think they paid off. I get why some people don't like it\\, but personally it's my second favorite star wars film\\, after empire. Excited to see what Rian Johnson does with his next star wars film\\, and excited to see where JJ takes episode 9.","true":true}
