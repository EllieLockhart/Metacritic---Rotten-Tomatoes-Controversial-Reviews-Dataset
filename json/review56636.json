Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi. Not good. Everything seems to have been mentioned. The story did not fit\\, as the characters. The first trilogy had an emotional bond\\, the prequels made us care about the Jedi and Obi Wan and made is intrigued to see how Anakin met his fate. The sequel trilogy\\, however\\, I seem not to care about any of the characters. This is the film where they should be getting their relationships developed and stories expanded. I liked the ideas for Finn\\, Rey and Poe but this act has not done anything for me to care about their characters or where they will go. All this rug pulling by Johnson seems odd in a a Star Wars film. The humour? Who wrote it? Rubbish. Ryan. You said you wanted to make it different or make a new path. There is a reason people are Star Wars fans. They like what they contain and the lore within them. Take that away and are you brave or changing for the sake of it?   49 percent? Five Star reviews that disappear with all trace off the account register when written? Shrills? In Disney's pockets? Final thoughts? Only a wanker would make Luke say 'Laser Sword'","true":true}
