Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a Star Wars movie so it's really cool. But sometimes they took it far especially with the jokes and I don't like the new way the force is used by Rey and Kylo and in the end by Luke. Some of the unexpected turns are really nice. I feel like they could've done more with the battle on crait.","true":true}
