Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst SW movie ever. The plot doesn't have any sense\\, severe abuse of jokes\\, many SW's rules violated\\, many \\\"plot twists\\\" are just bad ones\\, too much politics in the movie (girls are smart\\, men are stupid and violent\\, all white men are all nazis except for Luke\\, rich people are evil in many ways\\, etc)\\, many dialogs are very bad. The movie is so bad that Phantom Menace looks like a master piece compared to it.","true":true}
