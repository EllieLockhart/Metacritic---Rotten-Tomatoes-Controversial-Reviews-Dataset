Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was completely atrocious. It seemed like it was written by a miserable feminist who had never watched a Star Wars movie before. There were character inconsistencies everywhere\\, poorly timed & dumb jokes\\, & ridiculous & unnecessary politicization. It was a slap in the face to every fan of the franchise. So disappointed. So awful.","true":true}
