Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really looking forward to this movie after the force awakens was unexpectedly really good but this movie is utter and complete rubbish so full of plot holes and just awful writing the dude who directed this should be ashamed of himself this train wreck of a movie.","true":true}
