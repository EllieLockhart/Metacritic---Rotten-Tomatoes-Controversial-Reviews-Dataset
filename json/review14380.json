Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had conflicted feelings the first time I watched it. I decided to see it again to resolve my questions. I was able to leave the expectations that I built up behind and watch it that 2nd time. It is a really wonderful movie. I actually loved it. I do suggest to give it a 2nd viewing.","true":true}
