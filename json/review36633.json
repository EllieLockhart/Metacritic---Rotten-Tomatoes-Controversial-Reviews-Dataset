Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is certainly NOT perfect\\, but this weird narrative that it shatters everything we know about Star Wars with its subversion is simple hyperbole. The middle act does slow down the movie with an errand quest that literally does NOTHING to develop the world or it's characters (save for Star Wars newcomer Rose). The movie also fails to further explains Kylo or Rey's mysteries and has one of the most bizarre mid-movie twists in all of cinema. But why 5 stars? Because at its core\\, it is still Star Wars! It's entertaining\\, has a great opening sequence and the final arc in the movie redeems all of its flaws.","true":true}
