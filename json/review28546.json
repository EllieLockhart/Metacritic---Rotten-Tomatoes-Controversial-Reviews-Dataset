Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably one of the worst Star War movies in a long time. The biggest problem with this movie is with the story itself. This movie makes me question who the hell did Disney hired to write the story. Do they even know the SW universe lore? Anyway\\, watch it for yourself. One of the worst SW movies (behind attack of the clones) to have ever been made. 4.5\/10 or 2\/5","true":true}
