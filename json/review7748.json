Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent film\\, and what a great way to see Luke Skywalker help push the Resistance onward with a final standoff with Kylo Ren.  The Star Wars series is now about the new chapters\\, the new challenges\\, and the new characters.  I welcome how much the series has opened up as a result of these last two movies.  I am also eager to learn more about Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, and certain sub-series in the making.","true":true}
