Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I literally can\u2019t sit through this movie\\, it\u2019s absolute trash\\, little to no continuity with anything episode 7 attempted to set up. With laughable dialogue\\, ridiculous writing and story arcs that turn the characters we are supposed to enjoy into a joke. Worst Star Wars movie ever made period and any true Star Wars fan would realize this. ","true":true}
