Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sticks out like a sore thumb among the greatness that is Star Wars. It is an abomination and a complete deconstruction of the Star Wars mythos. All gravitas that the saga had gets flushed down the toilet with this pathetic piece of crap. From continuity errors (within the movie itself and with the saga)\\, plot holes and contrivances\\, terrible character development\\, a lack of direction\\, jokes that ruin tension and drama\\, progressive political agendas\\, pointless plot-lines\\, the antithesis of Luke Skywalker's character and a complete disregard for the Star Wars mythos this movie does not belong and should have never reached theaters. It is neither bold nor original\\, as it mostly rehashes plots from Empire and Jedi\\, but tries to subvert expectations with illogical \\\"gotchya moments\\\" that get real old real fast and kill any tension or stakes characters could have had. A truly bold direction would have been having either Rey turn to the Dark side or Ben Solo turn to the Light side\\, which would have charted new territory for the Star Wars Saga as there would still be one episode left to continue and explore this new direction. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed of themselves. I was really looking forward to where this trilogy was heading after TFA but now I just don't care. The Last Jedi retroactively ruined TFA by disregarding continuity\\, killed any excitement for episode IX and disrespects all that is Star Wars. \\nP.S. Rian and Kathleen\\, you killed the wrong Skywalker twin.","true":true}
