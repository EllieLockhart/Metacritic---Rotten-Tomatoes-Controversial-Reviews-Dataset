Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is better than George Lucas' prequel trilogy and \\\"Return of the Jedi\\,\\\" but it doesn't achieve the heights of \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\" There are some things I did not get about the filmmakers' vision. They set up Laura Dern and her purple hair to assume the General Leia throne and then kill her off (though spectacularly). They bring back Luke Skywalker\\, give him a super epic battle scene with Vader's grandson\\, and then kill him off (though emotionally). And they appear to kill off Leia only to bring her back to life\\, leaving her the only non-droid\\, non-Wookiee original character alive at the end of the film (though we all know that Carrie Fisher tragically will not be around for Episode IX). Despite the excessive running time\\, there's lots to admire in the latest \\\"Star Wars\\,\\\" and I was happy to see Luke and Leia get a farewell scene and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver emerge as the leads going forward (they are far more compelling than Oscar Isaac and John Boyega). But now that Han\\, Luke and Leia are all gone\\, will the next generation \\\"Star Wars\\\" characters be able to capture anything like the magic that makes the original trilogy beloved more than three decades later? I guess we'll find out in a couple of years.","true":true}
