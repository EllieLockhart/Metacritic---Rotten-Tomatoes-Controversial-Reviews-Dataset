The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This review contains spoilers\\, but I also believe that it will be an accurate expression for all gamers who feels disappointed and angry.\r\rThe game starts beautifully\\, Joel immediately explains what happened in the hospital and during the game\\, we can see what's happening between Ellie and Joel with a few flashbacks. But we can not see the rest of the 4 years of relationship between our protagonists because Joel gets killed like as if he is a monster and villain by some random characters. Ellie is included in cycle of revenge and the story continues. After that we play with the random character called Abby and find out that she is the surgeon's daughter Joel killed in the first game. From every point\\, things get ridiculous. That surgeon was nothing more than a NPC\\, he didn't have a little background at all and no one didn't even know who Abby is. She came out of nowhere and destroyed the character development\\, the story. After that the game forces players to play as Abby and tries to make players sympathize with Abby. Unfortunately the damage is gone. The developer tries to integrate the doctor's importance with some flashbacks. Furthermore Ellie and the characters who are around her turns into worthless living beings against Abby Then the story comes to an end but it's terrible as well like the rest of the story. The final scene tells everyone that everything was for nothing. Complicated time line\\, unexpected characters and scenes\\, excellent motivations\\, touching backgrounds\\, turning players against the main characters. This game is a masterpiece! Hmm\\, nope.\r\rIn a nutshell\\, this game is a disrespect to all gamers who saw Joel and Ellie's story and felt their emotions\\, characters\\, the world that the developer created. Contradictory decisions which isn't fit with characters\\, wasted emotions and character developments for a cheap cycle of revenge\\, uninteresting new characters\\, unnecessary sex scene\\, exaggerated violence\\, incoherent and meaningless ending.\r\rI'll give only 1 point to this game as a respect to Gustavo Santaolalla\u2026 Expand","true":true}
