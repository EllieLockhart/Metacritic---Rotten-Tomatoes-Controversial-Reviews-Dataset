Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke deserved better; Disney decided to crap all over this generational character to kill his legacy. Why?\\n\\nLuke calling it in at the end\\, Snoke being easily defeated\\, Leia Supermanning\\, and Rey's character has turned out to be uninteresting... I have no desire to learn more about Disney's version of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
