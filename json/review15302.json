Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I listened to people complain about this movie for a year after watching it 3 or 4 times.  I seriously began to consider all of the complaints about the movie and figured maybe the movie was not as good as I remembered.  Then I watched it again.  I TRIED to dislike it and I couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t.  Sure\\, there are parts that I was unhappy with\\, but I find myself filled with joy after every viewing of this movie.  There was some great character development\\, visually stunning scenes\\, unexpected turns\\, and fun action.  I love Star Wars\\, and the fact that it didn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t go where I expected makes it feel more real!","true":true}
