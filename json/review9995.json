Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great film! One of the top Star Wars films thus far! I'm confused about all the hate. I've been a fan since the early 80's and I would think true fans would know a well done Star Wars film when they saw it. Apparently not. The actions scenes are flawless\/enthralling. The major plot line is completely original and captivating. I cared about all the characters. There were some really interesting\/risky plot twists that all paid off. It was serious\\, humorous and had a lot of heart. Mark and Carrie were incredible. What a wonderful tribute to all Star Wars fans. Instant Classic.","true":true}
