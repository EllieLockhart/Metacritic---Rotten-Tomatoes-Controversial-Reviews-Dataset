Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who was that old man? Because it wasn't Luke Skywalker. This movie took my favorite character from the originals and turned him into somebody I can't recognize. Even Mark Hammil hated his new character and that should've been a hint to Rian Johnson that things would not end up well. Now\\, Johnson is having to address fans all the time due to backlash. Note to writers\/directors: just because you have plot twist after plot twist in your films does not qualify them to be great movies. Stick to what has brought you over 40 years and don;t ruin it instead.","true":true}
