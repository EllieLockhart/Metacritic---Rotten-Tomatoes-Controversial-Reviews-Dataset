Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has taken a valuable piece of IP which has more successfully than any other franchise crossed boundaries as epic stories of good\/evil friendship\\, love\\, and bravery -and turned it into a 2edgy4me sophomoric essay on abandoning the past.\\n\\nIt's ultimately clumsily handled and poorly directed\\, leaving a cast of flat and confused characters nowhere left to go in episode 9. Out of place comedy\\, infuriatingly awkward interjections of ultimately undeveloped political themes\\, and a bevy of new characters who weren't as interesting as the old ones chucked in the trash.\\n\\nAll the wrong moves were made for the wrong motivations. It feels like Rian Johnson deliberately made all his film-making decisions in order to spite his audience rather than to move the ball forward.","true":true}
