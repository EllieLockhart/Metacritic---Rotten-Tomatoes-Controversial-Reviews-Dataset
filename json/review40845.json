Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie completely destroyed everything that JJ tried to bring to the story\\, and completely destroyed the story potential\\, by killing off villain (who had a huge buildup in the last movie as a very powerful character) and killed off the wrong person from the original series at the end.","true":true}
