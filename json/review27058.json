Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the greatest cinematic accomplishments for Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi subverted expectations and challenged fans of the series to \\\"unlearn what they had learned\\\" while maintaining the themes of what makes a good story: failure\\, hope\\, and redemption. While the movie\\, unfortunately\\, misses the stylistic feel of Star Wars\\, the decision to move forward in bold and creative storytelling\\, rather than fan-service moments\\, has allowed this to be a movie that will be marked as one of the greatest in the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
