Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like we spent an hour and a half watching a big ship chase a smaller ship while firing useless shots into the shield of the smaller ship. Little interaction with new worlds\\, which is one of my favorite parts of the Star Wars movies. Battles that took place between the Rebels and First Order were mundane and par for the course. That being said\\, I'm looking forward to the next installment. Wouldn't spend another 15 dollars to see again in theaters.","true":true}
