Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, really enjoyed this movie despite what \\\"die hard fans\\\" are saying. I grew up watching Star Wars and watching TLJ was a great experience. Was there wasted potential on some characters? Sure but we really got to learn more about the characters and backstory about what's going on this universe. I really feel like people disliked this film because all the theories regarding Rey\\, Snoke and Luke were just wrong and people will be salty about it. I guess people just want the same predictable movies all the time. Just my two cents. 9\/10.","true":true}
