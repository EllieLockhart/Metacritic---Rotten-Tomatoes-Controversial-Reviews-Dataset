{"101487":169577,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers Ya'll:\\n\\n\\nWhy send Poe to clear the Dreadnaught's cannons in order to facilitate bombers to blow it up\\, then to order him to not remove the cannons and order the bombers to not go through with their plan? I mean\\, this is a phased military operation\\, and hopefully they planned to account for contingencies during each phase of the operation. But they didn't think that Poe would actually accomplish his mission and planned to abandon the mission when it got difficult?\\n\\nWhy were the bombers so slow in the opening sequence? This created unnecessary tension that took away from the amazing spectacle that it was intended to be.\\n\\nI get that Kylo didn't want to kill his mom\\, but he just killed his dad\\, and is once again attempting to impress Snoke. So why not? It's a part of his character arc. Additionally\\, how did he become this amazing pilot? And as an amazing pilot\\, why didn't he have more control over his wingmen regarding when and where they shot? If he had ordered them to kill the resistance\\, then why avoid firing on his mom when there is a 100 percent probability that his wingmen would fire if he didn't. This was a wasted scene for effective character development. \\n\\nWhy give Leia space flying powers? This could have been a tragic ending for her character that helped drive guilt inside Kylo to give more weight to the later scenes. \\n\\nWhy didn't Vice Admiral Haldo just explain her plan? I mean\\, that's what leaders do\\, right? Give people a mission statement\\, direction and maintain morale? They explain this to the audience that Haldo didn't want to be a \\\"hero\\\"\\, just wanted to do the right thing. Well\\, as a leader\\, the right thing is to be clear with your mission statement and avoid ambiguity at all costs. For god's sake\\, her crap leadership encouraged insubordination and mutiny!\\n\\nHow does Finn have an extensive knowledge of interstellar physics to know how the First Order tracks ships through Lightspeed? He was a sanitation engineer. This doesn't make sense. Additionally\\, how did the First Order track the main frigate? This was never explained. Rather than fly to Canto Byte to find a random hacker that just so happens to be a different hacker in order to hack their way into the First Order ship\\, why not just try to find the tracing device on the Resistance Ship?\\n\\nLuke said that he disappeared to the farthest place he could imagine\\, but that place is Ach To\\, the sacred Jedi temple? These two points don't match up? You either went there for a reason\\, or you ran away. He even says that Jakku is nowhere. Why didn't he go there instead?\\n\\nWhy did Luke throw his father's lightsaber away? It has way more emotional value to him than to Rey. For god's sake\\, they have him shaking when he grabs it. \\n\\nWhy show Luke squeezing milk out of an alien animal's tit and drink it in front of Rey? How does that develop his character?\\n\\nSo\\, Luke catapults himself on a ten story tall pole that apparently has a spear on the bottom of it in order to catch a fish that he can't see. It never explains how he got it from the bottom of enormous pole\\, up ten stories\\, and back to his hut without using the force. Which\\, btw\\, was explained later that he shut himself off from the force for years. So....huh?\\nWhy didn't they explain the Force Tree better?\\n\\nWhy the buildup for the Jedi Holy texts\\, then to treat it like it was a throwaway plot point? \\n\\nHow do Force Ghosts shoot lightening? Why was Luke going to burn the temple\\, that he viewed as sacred\\, when the texts themselves were not valued nor threatened by Rey or anyone? Then to turn around and want to save them? Also\\, I thought Force Ghosts were supposed to be neutral and represent balance in the Force? And why does Yoda look like a crappy puppet that Disney found in an abandoned Lucasfilm lot?\\n\\nRey opens herself up to Luke's first training session\\, is poorly guided\\, sees a Dark side place on Ach-to\\, is drawn to it and Luke is pissed that she didn't even try to resist it. Later\\, she goes there\\, and nothing happens. She just sees herself. \\n\\nCrap. When Luke went into the dark side cave on Degobah\\, he faced Darth Vader\\, beat him\\, only to see that he could become him. Yoda did not mind that Luke went into the Dark side cave. Actually\\, it was a rite of passage for Jedi to face themselves. So why is Luke angry at Rey\\, scared of her going to the Dark Side cave\\, and when she does go\\, nothing happens\\, and its treated like it's not an issue? \\n\\nSnoke said that as darkness rises\\, so does the light\\, eluding to Rey. So\\, there is a little bit of lore-building going on\\, then\\, nothing. He dies. \\n\\nSnoke manipulated Ben Solo as a child from across the galaxy. He manipulates Kylo and Rey from across the Galaxy. He is crazy powerful in the force. Calls Kylo a child\\, but that child out-mind-manipulates the supreme leader and kills him? Seriously?\\n\\nRey is a nobody from nobody parents but has all these powers? JJ at least set up a great opportunity for lore-building. Rian didn't take the chance to develop it. Just turned it into nothing. \\n\\nI can go on\\, but\\, wow. It's just... wow. \\n\\nThanks Kathleen and Rian. Star Wars is dead because of bad writing and direction. You should be ashamed.","true":true}
