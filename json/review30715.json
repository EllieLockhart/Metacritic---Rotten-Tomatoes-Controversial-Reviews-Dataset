Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJW Star Wars movie Episode 8. This movie was the disappointment of the year for me. The craft people did an amazing job but beyond that the choices at the executive and writing\/directorial level were unforgivable. I loved TFA but this was TRASH.\\n\\nThey killed off Luke and Snoke for virtually no reason and missed huge opportunities with the Ray Jedi development story. I don't think they could have shoe-horned anymore women characters into this either. They have excluded any white good guys for the sake of being diverse. Not even my 12 year old son like this and he likes most Star wars and super hero media. There are no characters left for him to relate to.\\n\\nI know it doesn't matter because this will still make lots of $ but I'm done with Star Wars.","true":true}
