Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow!  What a let down.  My 8 year old walked out of the movie saying it was trying to be \\\"funny\\\" and it was not \\\"Star Warsish.\\\"  I have zero desire to see this movie again.  Star Wars fans usually see the movies multiple times.  This will be the first one I don't see again.  I was actually bored towards the end.  Everything does not have to be a swerve Rian!  Why do the opposite of what everyone wants!? That is what this film seemed to want to accomplish.  The film actually felt like the culmination of a trilogy not the middle movie.  Where do they go from here?  Does anyone care about the next movie?  No more big baddie\\, Luke\\, Han\\, or Leia. \\n\\nThis movie makes The Force Awakens a decent film!\\n\\nHalf star Luke sucking off that creature.\\n\\nWTF!?","true":true}
