Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst of all starwars films. Very weak story with unexciting characters. The Poe Rose Fin story arc was a completely silly and adds noting but screentime. Killing Snoke was also a huge mistake. The story is mostly a contest to see who can be more incompetent and blink first and make a correct tactical move","true":true}
