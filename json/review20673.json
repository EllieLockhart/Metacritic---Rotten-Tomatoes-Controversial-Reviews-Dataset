Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've thought long and hard about this film since I've seen it. There's so many moments that impact what it means to be Star Wars fan. Love\\, loss\\, hope\\, and overcoming difficult times. Star Wars takes us away from our world and this is one I will want to go back to visit over and over.","true":true}
