Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Proof that the critics are getting paid off to write fawning reviews of this movie.  None of it makes sense\\, and all the questions raised in TFA were mostly for nothing.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver give the only performances worth any sort of praise\\, especially the former.  Unfortunately for most of the movie \\,I felt that I was able to experience what it must have been like to see The Phantom Menace in theaters.  Bash the prequels for what they are but at least the movies added something to the general arc and story in each movie.\\n\\nAt the end of the day Disney made a shitty movie that's more Hogwarts than Star Wars to sell more toys under the guise being of creating an \\\"inclusive\\\" or \\\"inventive\\\" movie.  Similar  to the Finn\/Rose arc where they visit a planet of arms dealers for The First Order\\, to be revealed they also sell weapon tech to The Resistance\\, Disney doesn't actually care about the moral high ground they are trying to sneak in as much as they care about bodies in seats and Star Wars plush toys and Lego sales.  Per The New Yorker Review \\\"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a story about the Resistance\\, but the film itself is a cinematic masterwork of the First Order.\\\"","true":true}
