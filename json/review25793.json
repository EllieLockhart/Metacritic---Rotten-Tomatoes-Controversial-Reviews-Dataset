Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not bad but it`s the worst Star Wars movie so far\\, the story does not respect the base and anything. Luke is a JEDI but here looks like a real looser\\, I just don\u00b4t understand and this just one fact\\, there are a lot more.","true":true}
