Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. Its as though the writer\/director of this film didnt even watch the force awakens. its like he had someone give him the basic plot points and he just scribbled stuff down. \\n\\nOn top of it\\, there was no story except for the rey\/luke\/kylo arc. The resistance does nothing the entire movie. its just one long drawn out car chase. But hey\\, maybe if we make the movie 2.5 hours long nobody will notice. \\n\\nThe phantom menace was better. Dont believe the critic reviews. these loser critics have damaged their credibility by clearly taking money from Disney.","true":true}
