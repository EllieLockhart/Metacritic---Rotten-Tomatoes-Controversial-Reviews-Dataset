Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First\\, let's address a consistent inaccuracy of many online reviews\\, in that this is a generational issue\\, a difference falling on disputes between baby-boomers and millennials.  Absolute nonsense\\, more often spouted by a millennial but that's the folly of youth.  The fandom generation that MADE Star Wars\\, both back then and now in terms of audience\\, is clearly Gen X and Gen Y (if such a thing exists).  Baby boomers were the creators of the film but the Star Wars audience was clearly Gen X and eventually after re-releases Gen Y as well.  So please stop using the general term \\\"audience\\\" as if sixty years didn't happen and that this film somehow is one generation (baby-boomers) trying to hold to something that now is handled by the next generation (millennials).\\n\\nNow\\, if I really have to go further than milking four-breasted aliens\\, let's deal with what truly makes Star Wars franchise films a (barely) important discussion: money.  Certified Fresh is never going to be a tag applied to any Star Wars (-SW) film\\, post 1984.  The efforts can be made to expand or to continue an explanation in the so called SW universe.  However calling this or any SW film fresh is impossible.  The three originals\\, from creator George Lucas\\, were ground-breaking.  In many ways what we have today as now standard practice\\, back then wasn't even an established profit method.  Franchises weren't viewed with nearly the same clout as they are in today's media saturated environment.  SW back then was fresh.\\n\\nToday it's re-selling hula-hoops as plastic donuts\\, a contextual reality that no filmmaker's pedigree or added bonus CGI is going to change.\\n\\nAnd yes\\, it's relevant to talk about profits in a review because the SW franchise isn't simply a film being released.  Instead it's an entire industry being unleashed\\, with everything from toys\\, Halloween costumes\\, bed sheets\\, clothing\\, breakfast cereal\\, and the list goes on and on ad nauseam.  So if a film is going to receive that level of automatic public square attention\\, regardless of any true artistry\\, earning our attention-by-marketing then opens the door to reviews-by-balance sheet.\\n\\nOne last comment\\, purely subjective... what I felt was truly missing from this major disappointment was just simple fun.  Where was the comic relief?  Where was the amazing Force in action?  Just like bringing an old dog to the vet\\, the film we saw put down a hero\\, a cultural touchstone and other than the music cue it barely registered.  No cool blaster fights running around an amazing space station that no-one could imagine existing\\, no amazing speed run through an asteroid field or a dense jungle fight on space-age motorcycles.  Nothing.  A slow crawl through space where literally thousands of people died\\, we never see anything\\, and then a petulant millennial shoots a hologram to death.","true":true}
