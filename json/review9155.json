Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun movie.  Great looking.  Amazing special effects.  Unfortunately the story\\, plot holes\\, and inconsistencies with TFA and earlier moves can't be overlooked.  Rian Johnson did NOT pick up where JJ Abrams left off.  Abrams left some Chekhov's guns ready to go off that never did\\, and it seemed it was in the name of 'shock value'.   I don't believe Johnson cared or even checked to see if his movie was a proper sequel.  The trilogy has one more chance to close loops and explain things.","true":true}
