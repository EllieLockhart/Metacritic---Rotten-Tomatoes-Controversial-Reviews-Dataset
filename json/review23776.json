Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke\u2019s line from the trailer\\, \u201cthis isn\u2019t going to go the way you think\u201d was right on the money. This movie takes risks\\, and spins a lot of the common tropes associated with the series on their head. The Last Jedi is a wild ride start to finish\\, I\u2019m going to have to watch it a few more times before I give it a ranking in the saga. One thing is for sure\\, I can\u2019t get it out of my head.","true":true}
