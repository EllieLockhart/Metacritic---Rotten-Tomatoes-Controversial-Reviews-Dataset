Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overwhelmingly amazing. The Last Jedi is a fresh (yet loyal)\\, mind-blowing and immensely captivating addition to the Star Wars universe. It takes you on an emotional whirlwind but leaves you more in love with Star Wars than you already were. The film is also a beautiful tribute to Carrie Fisher. Rian Johnson did a fantastic job. As a massive Star Wars fan since childhood I can easily say The Last Jedi is one of the top 3 films in the Star Wars saga\\, if not the absolute best. Can't wait to watch it again and again.","true":true}
