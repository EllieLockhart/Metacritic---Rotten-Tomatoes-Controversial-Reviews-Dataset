Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With some flaws\\, this is a solid installment of the Star Wars Saga. The relationships in this film are wonderfully complex and there are a few stand up and cheer character moments.","true":true}
