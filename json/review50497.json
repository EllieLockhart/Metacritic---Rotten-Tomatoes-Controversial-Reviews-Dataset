Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1.5 for aesthetics\\, sound design\\, music and cinematography. \\n\\nEverything else about this movie is hollow. If all you care about is the visual appeal of Star Wars\\, loud noises and something pretty to look at this is the movie for you. \\n\\nIf you're like the rest of us and you enjoy a bit of depth and some semblance of continuity to your Star Wars\\, you'll probably hate it. I was willing to overlook the problems Force Awakens had because I could see potential for the next film. Rian Johnson decided to essentially take Force Awakens\\, crumple it up into a ball\\, take a shit on it then light it on fire. \\n\\nFuck you Disney","true":true}
