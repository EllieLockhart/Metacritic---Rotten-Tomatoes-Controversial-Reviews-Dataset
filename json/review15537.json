Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved\\, loved\\, loved this film! The bot attack trolling this film can say what it likes\\, but the characters were interesting and believable\\, the pace was good (I was not bored and the film is more than 2 hours long)\\, it's visually lush and the plot is really interesting. It's a lot more of an adult film than episode seven and it provokes thought\\, I loved it and will see it again and again.","true":true}
