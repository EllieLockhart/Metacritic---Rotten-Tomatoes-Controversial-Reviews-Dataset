We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As a fan of TLOU1 I came into this game apprehensive. I stayed away from leaks and spoilers but I had a feeling that something big was going to happen. And BAM it did\\, death of a main character from the first game\\, it shoot me. The idea of a revenge story was interesting to me. It was mentally painful at times to play\\, to deal with my grief and the grief of the characters in game but I stuck it out and became fascinated by the story and the characters. Ellie and Dina have amazing chemistry and their love shows throughout. But Ellie's need for revenge outweighs everything else to the point of obsession. It's pretty brutal.\r\rThere is a point where the game switches gears and you all of a sudden play as the character that killed the main protagonist from the first game and for me I was SO MAD at that.. for about 30 minutes. Then when my anger waned and I was able to get back to the game I started to enjoy playing as her and as her history and motives are shown I started to grow to care for her as well.\r\rYou think the game is ending but it isn't there's actually a few more hours and then the real end is really emotionally heavy.  I left the game unhappy\\, not with the game just with everything\\, I was emotionally exhausted. It took me a day to really work through my feelings and then I understood how amazing the game was. No other game has ever made me actually think about consequences for actions and the emotional toll of doing things like this game did. It isn't something I would play to be happy but it's something I will play again just to get that feeling back\\, to understand each character further\\, to enjoy a piece of media that makes me FEEL something viscerally.\r\rMechanically\\, the gameplay is a huge step up from the first game\\, the movement is fluid\\, you can now prone\\, and the dodge is fantastic. the crafting goes further and you have many more skills you can access in your skill trees. Even if you didn't like the story I can't see how you could give this game a lesser rating\\, just based off of how smooth the gameplay is.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
