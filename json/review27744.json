Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People need to wake up and see these critics are paid off. Huge discrepancy between their rating and what us viewers saw. This movie was a complete disaster. After all that hype and speculation of \\\" who Rey's parents or lineage was\\\". It turns out that  Rey's parents turned out to be unknown dead people. What a political correct mess that was shoved down our throats. Luke was basically a bipolar wimp. His character deserved so much more. I hope you idiots that dumped all over Revenge of the Sith realize\\, It's far better than this dump heap.","true":true}
