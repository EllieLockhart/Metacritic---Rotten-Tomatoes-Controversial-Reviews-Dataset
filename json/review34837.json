Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the entire film was a 'gotcha' the plot twists so much and so frequently that you arent surprised by the end. It also completely changes the characters as we once knew them (from the first 6 movies)\\, such that it seems like they are different people entirely. the fight scenes weren't great either\\, with so many small errors that you wonder if the actors were prepared at all to do fight scenes. this movie (and trilogy) disrespects star wars as it once was","true":true}
