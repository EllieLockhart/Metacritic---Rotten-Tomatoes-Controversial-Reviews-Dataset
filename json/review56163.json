Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***SPOILERS****\\n\\nSo\\, let me get this straight. The guy who helped take down the Empire has a bad day and he turns into a recluse?\\n\\nAnd the guy who gets demoted for insubordination feels like an admiral owes him an explanation?\\n\\nAnd the First Order is chasing for HOURS a ship instead of FTL-ing a few ships to the front of the Resistance's ship and blowing it up in just a few minutes? \\n\\nAnd you wiped the extended universe just to find out that Rey's parents are nobody after building up the mystery? \\n\\nAnd you made Luke become one with the force because? What? Just because? Too much death in this movie. Too many losses. \\n\\nSnoke gets killed like there was zero point in him having been around. And is it Kylo Ren still? Or is he now just Ben? And where are the Knights of Ren? And why did you spend so much time hyping Phasma just so that she could be worked both times we see her?! \\n\\nOnce again\\, the movies fail to live up to the legend. Your casual fan base will enjoy this movie. But this movie does a disservice to loyal geeks. And make no mistake: WE are the ones who buy the merchandise. We are the ones who kept Star Wars alive through books and games. And we are disappointed.","true":true}
