Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a beautifully shot\\, and at sometimes brilliant\\, film\\, however\\, some of what I was hoping for the story\\, specifically around Luke\\, left me a little flat. It would have been great to see more of his power\\, more of his psychology\\, more of his story. As a whole this movie did a good job moving the story forward\\, and left us with some breathtaking visuals\\, but the character development I wish was a little stronger.","true":true}
