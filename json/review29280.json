Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey\\, Luke and Kylo are amazing and drives the plot forward while everything else is completely tasteless. 3\/4 of the movie is basically the First Order fleet chasing the Resistence Fleet in space in the slowest pace ever. Nothing on Canto Bight sequence makes sense. Finn and Rose go looking for some guy then ends up freeing animals? Holdo doesn't tell Poe the plan for no reason only to cause further internal conflict. Hyperspace into enemy ships is now a thing. Finn could have sacrificed himself to save his friends yet Rose had to save him. Oh and Luke dies on a rock. Great progressive ideas\\, great visuals\\, great character development in terms of our Force sensitive heroes. I even love the Yoda sequence and controversial General Leia part. Other than that\\, no one does anything cool.","true":true}
