Aside from all that we all expected the Combat\\, Gameplay\\, Customization\\, Visuals\\, Graphics\\, Soundtrack\\, Infected\\, Mechanics\\, AI to be phenomenal which it was but with The Last Of Us being a mostly story driven game and \u201cEllies Revenge\u201d never really being a thing I think its fair to rate it a 5\/10 would I buy it again ? Definitely not for the 60$ price point especially with it having no multiplayer mode but if you could snatch it for a lower price it definitely would not be a complete waste like I said right direction but was not executed in the right way not that everyone expected it to be a Disney fairytale but it really does feel like there\u2019s no possible way this is what a company like Naughty Dog comes up with in a 6 year development of one of the most cherished PlayStation exclusives of all time\u2026 Expand","true":true}
