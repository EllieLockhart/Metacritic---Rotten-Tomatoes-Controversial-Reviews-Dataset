Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly unimaginative\\, and insulting to a large number  of fans who grew up loving Star Wars. It could have been done so well\\, but instead it trashed so much of the greatness of Star Wars. Careful young enthusiasts of this film\\, if Disney would treat prior fans with this much contempt\\,  you're next.","true":true}
