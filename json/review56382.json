Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"That movie was absolutely HORRIBLE!!!  It was like the script was written by a bunch of 12 year old kids and half of them had never seen a Star Wars movie.  Weak story; weak character development; weak battle scenes; weak everything.  The music was excellent as always from John Williams.  However\\, this movie does not compare to anything from the other Star Wars movie and was just plain garbage.  It really adds nothing to the overall Star Wars story and basically makes the cherished characters out to be lame shadows of what they were.  Not a good movie at all.  If this is the new Star Wars direction for movies\\, then I'll go back to the books that were much\\, much better stories.  Don't waste your money on this movie.","true":true}
