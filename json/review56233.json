Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors the saga's rich legacy while adding some surprising twists -- and delivering all the emotion-rich action fans could hope for.\\\" <----- That's a joke right? Spoilers below.\\n\\nProceed if you don't care about them.\\n\\nI have watched the more recent StarWars films only once while in theater. And that was all I needed to know that the great icon is now dead. The movie series that Kathleen and JJ created disrespected the legacy and added no twists to the movie. Finn loves any girl as a typical guy\\, Kylo did what any sith does and betrays his master\\, Ray was told to not have parents and she doesn't. Luke was done being a Jedi so he let himself die.\\n\\nPretty straightforward in that sense. But overall I refuse to even bother with the franchise now. Only purchasing the HD Blu Ray set of episodes 1-6 with original content\\, and keeping my old VHS tapes of 4-6 in a special box for safe keeping. I highly recommended avoiding the movie for any reason\\, as it isn't worth sullying your love for StarWars.\\n\\nI sincerely hope Disney gets it's act together\\, banishes JJ and Kathleen from it's massive IP before it loses what little value is left. No one cares about the toys anymore or takes the movies seriously. Anymore it's just a reason to go to my local movie theater\\, get some beer and take a nap while StarWars plays in the background.\\n\\n\\nHowever Rouge One was miles better in my opinion\\, characters had depth\\, progression\\, and gave light to the ACTUAL lore. Unlike 7-8\\, where Ray goes from zero to Jedi Wielding Zero in .3 seconds. The explanation of her powers and how she randomly knows how to do things isn't explained\\, and her Jedi training doesn't feel at all realistic. Luke was on Dagobah for quite awhile\\, and getting constant training from Yoda. Ray didn't get that kind of training\\, she's just all powerful so deal with it right?\\n\\nI would give a zero star but that apparently isn't a thing like Metacritic offers.","true":true}
