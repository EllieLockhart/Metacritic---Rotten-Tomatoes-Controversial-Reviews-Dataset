Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Say it with the family and we all agreed that it is long\\, one of the better recent Star Wars but we were kinda hoping for the dark side to win to put an end to the entire star wars saga.  I think they are trying to reboot with new characters but those new characters do not match the original.  Hope this is the last Star Wars but if they do another one I will probably see it just out of curiosity.","true":true}
