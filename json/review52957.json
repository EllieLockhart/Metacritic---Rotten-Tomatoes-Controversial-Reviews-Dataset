Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A poorly paced\\, ill-conceived\\, and messy film. After feeling I had to see every film in the franchise for as long as I can remember\\, this film wins the prize of turning me off for good. Not interested in seeing the next episode.","true":true}
