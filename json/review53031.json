Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a \\\"sci-fi movie\\\" it was good\\, despite the several big plot\/story holes. As a part of a star wars franchise\\, utter disaster... it pretty much destroyed every single book\\, that takes place after the return of the jedi. Destroys the Skywalker legacy...  to which the whole star wars was based on... The last jedi kinda said\\, fuck off to all the other Star wars movies... \\n\\nEven I wanted more for the skywalker saga... only the end where skywalker died\\, was something good\\, but killing Luke Skywalker too... way too much...\\n\\nTerrible plot holes....  new order people even bigger idiots... than the empire... wow... chasing ship which is faster\\, but still does not run away from the new order... Guns were so ineffective\\, that they did not even make a dent in the shields... then other ships run away much much further and suddenly guns are effective...\\nAll the other rebel capital ships just loose power when they run out of fuel\\, no one else\\, \\\"I am going to die... 100% certainty\\, does not use the last drop of fuel to use lightspeed to ram the ships. except at the end...\\n\\nWay too many plot holes....  way too many story holes...  and travel so far for the bar and back\\, spend time in a cell etc... all this in a matter of hours...","true":true}
