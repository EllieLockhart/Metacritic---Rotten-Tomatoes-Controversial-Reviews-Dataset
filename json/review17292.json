Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I realy didn't like this movie because it is nothing with nothing. Luke is an idiot jn this movie\\, and the story is not how i espected. In my opjnion it is the worst Star Wars movie.","true":true}
