Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an OK Disney film and a poor Star Wars film. The effects are beautiful and the aesthetics are incredible\\, but the quality of the writing and characters is poor. Most characters are incredibly one dimensional and those that have more depth are rushed through their character development and have weak motivations. \\n\\nThe First Order is so grossly incompetent it's a wonder that they have any hold on any system. This becomes apparent within the first 10 minutes of the film during what I'll call the \\\"prank call scene.\\\" Jokes and gags take priority over building any real tension. Characters grin as they rush headlong into a suicide mission. The quippy and slapstick humor is often cringey. The huge disconnect between what the characters are experiencing\\, their attitudes\\, and their positions in their factions is jarring. I was mildly disappointed with The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jedi has crushed any hope I had of the new trilogy recapturing that Star Wars magic that has gripped multiple generations over the past decades.","true":true}
