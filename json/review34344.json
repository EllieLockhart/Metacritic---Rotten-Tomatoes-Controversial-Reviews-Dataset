Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The amount of positive reviews here is baffling.  I think Disney paid off most of the critics posting on here.  I went in really wanting to like it\\, but it is a horribly written movie and It's hard to take it seriously.  Can't emphasize enough how bad this movie is.  Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
