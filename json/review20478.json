{"101487":145814,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-07-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan for my entire life\\, watching the first 6 movies again and again since I was a child. I absolutely loved Rogue One and even thought that The Force Awakens was passable\\, and saw them in theater right upon release (bringing family and friends along). I was even willing to overlook the flaws with EA's BattleFront II\\, just because it had a Star Wars plot in it! I've spent money on Star Wars books\\, toys\\, games\\, and movies - and encouraged others to do so as well.\\n\\nBut then I saw The Last Jedi. Though I entered the theater with incredible excitement\\, hyped to see the resolution of so many mysteries and the return of some of the greatest characters of all time\\, who have been beloved for nearly half a century. I exited confused and horrified\\, unable to fully comprehend the lunacy of what I had just seen\\, hoping to awaken from a delirious nightmare. \\n\\nI cannot go into excruciating detail on all the problems with this movie\\, since that would require an entire book. I'll also try to avoid apoilers. My major gripes are these. (1) this movie has zero respect for the lore: several events in the movie break the established lore of the universe\\, and makes many major events in the other movies ridiculous or stupid (e.g. Holdos final action). (2) the movie has zero respect for many of its characters\\, particularly Luke\\, but even those from the previous ep VII. (3) Rey is too powerful\\, and never gets any serious training. She is more powerful than Anakin was after over a decade of training. Every scene with her just made me roll my eyes at how over-powered she was with absolutely no explanation (even if she was also born of the force like anakin\\, the lore still requires her to undergo extensive training). Maybe if they had hired actual writers\\, instead of using some kind of random word generator\\, they would have heard of \\\"suspension of disbelief\\\" and \\\"world-building\\\". (4) the movie is filled with strangely political scenes that nobody wants in an action movie\\, but I can't talk about that or I'll risk being censored. (5) There is not even respect for continuing from the last movie! Where are the Knights of Ren\\, for example? I would have loved to see them\\, but that would have added good scenes to the movie and that's apparently not what they were going for. (6) the characters on both sides of the fight are constantly doing laughably dumb things\\, that no one except a child could seriously believe seasoned military officers doing\\, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. I dont even need examples for this one\\, just watch the movie (preferably as cheaply as possible). (7) there are no proper battle scenes. There are one-sided pseudo battles\\, but no large scale ground or space battles involving large numbers of people where both sides more than a remote chance of winning. There are also no lightsaber battles\\, except for one in which nobody uses the force!\\n\\nThis movie does have some good parts. Kylo Ren is well-acted and could be really cool if he was in an actual movie instead of a disjointed set of agenda-driven ramblings. The visual effects and graphics are also a rather pleasant sight\\, though I'd expect anything costing such an astronomical sum of money to be commendable to some extent. Some of the humor was amusing as well. Luke was really cool for the few seconds he was actually allowed to do things that\\, in a sane world\\, his character would actually do. \\n\\nThis movie is like if someone saw what happened with Mass Effect Andromeda and thought\\, \\\"hey that went well; let's do that!\\\". Not only was it incompetently made\\, but it was made that way on purpose\\, for political purposes. And when people point that out\\, the company insults them. What kind of company lets their employees insult their customers on twitter? Disney does. What kind of company lets their executives say things like we don't need certain demographics of fans? Well\\, Disney let Kathleen Kennedy say it. Not only is the movie itself almost impressively bad\\, but the people who made it seem to have done so specifically\\, in order to hurt the fans of the franchise. It was clearly made by people who like neither Star Wars nor its fans\\, and have no interest in making money. And I blame the company that lets this continue.\\n\\nI did not see Solo\\, and as a result\\, nobody in my family did\\, since I would normally be the one to drag them along. I have zero interest in this franchise now and frankly in anything Disney does. Well done Disney. You managed to make lifelong fans of Star Wars turn their backs on your entire company - all for the low price of $4 billion!","true":true}
