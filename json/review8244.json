Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic visually\\, but the story\\, plot holes\\, useless subplots\\, and tons of things that didn't make sense made it confusing to watch. A lot of the characters were mishandled. I'm not a die-hard Star Wars fan\\, I just like good movies. Even if this movie had nothing to do with Star Wars\\, it's still a poorly written movie.","true":true}
