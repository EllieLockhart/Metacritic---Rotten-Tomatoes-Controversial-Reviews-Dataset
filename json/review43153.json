Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***THIS REVIEW IS DARK AND FULL OF SPOILERS***\\n\\nIt all comes down to this. The Force Awakens made me really want to see this one\\, whenever it eventually came out. After now having seen The Last Jedi\\, I have almost no interest to see Episode 9 whatsoever. It would've taken a remarkably bad film to kill my interest in this new trilogy\\, and that's exactly what it was...bad.\\n\\nBefore you start throwing shade\\, just know that I'm not someone who easily picks up the pitchfork and starts preaching my thoughts. I'm usually rational and try to look at everything as objectively as possible. So if you're going to trust any of these unqualified audience reviews\\, trust mine!\\n\\nBefore I begin to unleash my fury upon this review page like the crashing of a thousand waves\\, I will say that the cinematography in The Last Jedi was beautiful and there were a few state of the art scenes. Nevertheless\\, here are my reasons...\\n\\n - The main plot line is about the largest Resistance ship running out of fuel. Seriously. They spend over half of the movie focusing on this point\\, during which they try to escape the First Order in a chase slower than OJ Simpson trying to evade the cops in his white Bronco.\\n\\n - This lethargic plot leads to an unnecessary subplot where Finn and Rose spend almost an hour traveling to a certain planet to pick up a certain someone in order to accomplish a certain task so they can escape the First Order before their fuel runs out. Oh yeah\\, but it ends up not working at all and makes no difference in the outcome of the film.\\n\\n - This subplot is too obviously filler and appears to only be in the movie to take up time and to introduce this Rose character. Her role is essentially to make the viewer think \\\"Hey\\, maybe Rey and Finn won't end up together.\\\" And that's it.\\n\\n - Side note: Rey and Finn don't say a single word to each other in this movie even though they end up at the same place at the same time.\\n\\n - Snoke is killed without a backstory when he was one of the very few avenues through which we could've learned crucial details about some of these main characters and about the force in general.\\n\\n - Captain Phasma dies in a very cheesy and anticlimactic way\\, ending her Star Wars run with maybe 15 minutes of total screentime between the two films.\\n\\n - The overall tone of the film was very childish compared to any previous Star Wars movie\\, including The Force Awakens. There was almost as much humor in this film alone as there was in Episodes 1-7 combined. Almost every joke falls flat\\, and some of them kill extremely deep momentum-building scenes which could've set the tone right.\\n\\nI could go on forever baby (Home Alone reference)\\, but I'll stop there. On a final note\\, I just want to say that I tried my best to like this movie. There are a lot of people saying it's good...and...I don't know what planet they live on. Either way I'm still a Star Wars fan\\, but I'm definitely not a Last Jedi fan.","true":true}
