Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you think you know Star Wars\\, The Last Jedi will change everything you know. Fans of the original Trilogy will rejoice in witnessing their favorite characters return\\, and new comers to the series will be in awe at the stunning visuals\\, and incredible story. Each actor plays their role splendidly\\, and the final act of the movie will leave craving for more. The Last Jedi is proof that Star Wars is and always will be one of the greatest franchises in the world\\, or in this case the galaxy.","true":true}
