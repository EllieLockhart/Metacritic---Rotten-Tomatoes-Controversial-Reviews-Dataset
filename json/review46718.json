Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We didn't want a new story or a destruction of the universe....all we wanted was that great story lucas created to keep going....Disney totally missed the point of why we love the original movies....just keep milking that space cow Disney\\, no one is going to watch episode 9 except the critics","true":true}
