Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They should fire the director \\nThey try to add humour to the film which in some cases doesn't work \\nThe decision to kill off snoke so early is pathetic \\, snoke to people like me is an interesting character where you want to know more about him and in my opinion would've added a big chunk to the story but the fact that they killed him off only to make kylo ren the bigger character is repulsive. \\nIf star wars 9 introduces him back into the films it will be much better .\\nAt first watching the film it was good  and I enjoyed it but as soon as It came to the scene where snoke is killed off I thought wow that sucks \\nIt wasnt even a good way to kill him off considering that it was out of no where .\\nThe emperor palpatins death was good because it has a good meaning to it but kylo ren killing off snoke because he keeps missing his anger management classes is kind of pathetic. \\nAlso I didn't understand why they kept leia alive considering that they can't make no more movies with her\\n in them .\\nI do like kylo ren but the fact that they pretty much boosted him in the film is stupid cause his story of origin is trash and won't get people that interested \\nI didn't mind luke Skywalkers scenes cause they were interesting .\\nLet's hope they don't keep this director .\\nBecause maybe then Lucas arts and Disney could make a descent film.","true":true}
