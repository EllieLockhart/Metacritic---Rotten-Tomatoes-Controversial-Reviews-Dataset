Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars film to date I felt so strongly about this I actually signed up to write this I have no faith in these reviews now. Terrible script it's just a hash of Star Wars scenes we've seen before all over the place . Rogue one was good this is just trash","true":true}
