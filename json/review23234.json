Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it!  I personally think it is better than the last one.  It was entertaining and I did not see everything coming.  I enjoyed some of the humor and nods to the original trilogy.  For a second in a trilogy\\, it was great\\, because it wasn't simply a filler to get you to the end.  It's tying up some problems and relationships while introducing new characters and relationships all of which work towards unfolding the story of the bigger picture.","true":true}
