Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once again\\, a Star Wars movie has been breaking box office records. Why you may ask? It had good action scenes\\, good special effects\\, memorable characters like Rey and the most important of the all\\, it had a good plot. However\\, the reason I gave it a three and a half star was because it didn't have a good lightsaber battle\\, and Luke's character wasn't treated the way we expected. And seriously\\, why did you have to kill Snoke so early in the trilogy!","true":true}
