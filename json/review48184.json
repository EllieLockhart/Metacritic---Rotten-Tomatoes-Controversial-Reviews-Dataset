Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually stunning\\, The Last Jedi really failed to deliver on major plot points. The odd humor and ridiculous story telling was reminiscent of an off the shelf Marvel movie. I think this installment has done more harm than good and unfortunately alienated longtime fans of the franchise.  What a bummer :-(","true":true}
