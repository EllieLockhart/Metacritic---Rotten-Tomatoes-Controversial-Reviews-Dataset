Just because Joel died doesn't mean the game is doo doo. Many of these people are babies that saw their favorite youtubers disliking the game and hate comments from other babies and assume to hate too. The worst part is most of these dummies didn't even watch or play the game which is absolutely immature. Imagine working years on a game your insanely proud of just to be hated on and called crap because of your bosses belief or a character dying. Btw the story was phenomenal and I actually liked Abby's character. People only hate the game because they are FORCED to hate the game. If people even speak their mind they are shamed or yelled at which is ridiculous by babies who haven't played the damn game. I also played the game blind and didnt watch any leaks or spoilers which is why I enjoyed it so much.Also\\, dunkey is a godamn champ for being true to what he thought about the game and speaking facts. PROPS DUNKEY! Thanks for listening to my rant.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
