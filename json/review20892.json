{"101487":146488,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was born in 1980\\, so Star Wars was an obviously impactful presence throughout my childhood. There were yearly rituals with my two older sisters\\, heading to the video store and picking up the trilogy on VHS. In college\\, I hung the movie posters from the re-release on my dorm room wall... and several buddies and I camped out overnight on the sidewalk of a movie theatre so we could be among the first to pick up our tickets for the Phantom Menace when it came out.\\n\\nThe prequel trilogy was a let-down\\, but the sanctity of the originals remained. When Force Awakens came out\\, I found that it was not a perfect film\\, but it brought back the nostalgia\\, fun\\, and adventure I had been seeking since the credits rolled on Return of the Jedi. I felt it was a splendid move for Disney to take ownership of the franchise and return it more to its roots. \\n\\nI wasn't in love with Rogue One\\, but I still thought it was well done and interesting. The one thing it missed was a little bit of the light-hearted ness of the proper Star Wars movies. \\n\\nI came into The Last Jedi with high expectations. Who are Rey's parents? What is the story with Snoke? What has Luke been doing all these years? My one concern heading in is would they kill off Luke? I was still upset that Han is gone\\, but hey - it fit the narrative - and we all knew Harrison Ford wanted his character to die.  Little did I know the end of Luke's story would be the least miserable part of this film. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi failed on every level I could have imagined. The 4th-grade humor which didn't make sense in scenes and coming from many of the characters themselves... the train wreck of plot lines\\, most of which were dull\\, uninspired\\, and aggravating. Deep-space Leia was comical\\, (wasn't supposed to be). Snoke? Glad you got your 4 minutes of screen time\\, buddy. Turns out we didn't really need ya. Rey's parents - yeah\\, glad we waited for that reveal. It gives her Internet status as a \\\"Mary Sue\\\" even more credence. So\\, we as the audience are just to bare that she is seemingly the most amazing Jedi (and human being) in history not because she is a Chosen One\\, or the prophesized... but just a regular 'ol Jo(lene). Ugh.\\n\\nThose were all annoyances or flaws in the story\\, but the narrative as a whole did something I thought impossible: it not only killed this entire new trilogy for me\\, but it has maimed the entire saga as a whole. I could care less what happens in Episode 9 now. Is crybaby Kylo Ren what we have to look forward to in the finale? He has already had his butt handed to him by Rey... his butt handed to him by Snoke (before the lame lightsaber moment)... he has the emotional capacity of a 14 year old on steroids... and is frankly the lamest big bad I can imagine to carry a trilogy. \\n\\nI left this movie angry. Each of the prequels I left feeling disappointed\\, but they didn't ruin the originals for me. This one did. This hurt the entire franchise for me... and boy\\, that's a feat. \\n\\nHow the critics are giving this 93% approval is quite suspicious and now makes me question the merits of the whole film-critiquing industry. This was certainly not the best Star Wars movie ever made\\, as some critics called it. In some ways\\, I rank it even lower than the lowly prequels\\, which is really saying something. I hope I never see it again.","true":true}
