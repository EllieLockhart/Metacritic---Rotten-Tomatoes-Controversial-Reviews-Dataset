Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow ! .. that was a pretty painful 2 1\/2 hours .. consider this the \\\"Batman & Robin\\\" of Star Wars movies .. pretty random demonstrations of the Force that are completely implausible \\, random deaths and resurrections \\, and an overly long drawn out story line .. in summary \\, it's Disney erasing the past Star Wars so it can start something new and slap the \\\"Star Wars\\\" brand on it","true":true}
