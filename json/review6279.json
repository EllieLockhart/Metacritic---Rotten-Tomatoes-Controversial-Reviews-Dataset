Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is the mcdonalds of film making\\, and they just keep churning these movies out like those flattened bland cheeseburgers. Total cash grab that completely ignores the established lore of the universe and writing that just makes no sense. Horribly executed humor that attempts to mimic the marvel movies and fails completely. Wanted this movie to reinvigorate the franchise\\, instead it has killed it for me. I have no interest in star wars anymore\\, you can only screw up so much disney. You cant un fu@k this. Good job riann johnson.","true":true}
