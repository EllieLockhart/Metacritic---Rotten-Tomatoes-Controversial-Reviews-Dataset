Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"We finished the game in 2 days. My beginning thoughts: If we\u2019re going to have a new storyline\\, market it right. Don\u2019t blind us into a game where you marketed it as Ellie & Joel then introduce a whole new city of characters\\, characters we didn\u2019t even want to play. Maybe this type of storyline would work in the 3rd installment\\, for you don\u2019t even get to play as Joel\\, and you play as Abby more than Ellie. Why would we want to play as the enemy? Why would we want to play as the enemy when fighting Ellie? Why would we go all this way to fight Abby to have her be let go? This is why The Last of Us gets a low rating: - I don\u2019t appreciate how Joel died so early in the game as well. We could have at least played as him for halfway\\, or we could have known about his death and let up to it later in the game\\, not the 2nd scene already. - The cutscenes were barely there and all over the place. You play for so long for one cutscene. Then at the end there\u2019s cutscene after cutscene.- why does Abby get a workbench every 5 seconds\\, gets all this good guns & crafting gear\\, then when you play as Ellie you get a workbench once a day. We barley tried when playing Abby and she got all these good gear & looting as the story progressed. The whole time playing the game we just thought it was pretty stupid. It was hard to play when we didn\u2019t want to play it\\, but we had to see what happens next. While I do appreciate the scenery and backgrounds in this game\\, I just think Naughty Dog knew this was a money maker and wanted to **** it up regardless knowing they would make money anyway. Also\\, did anyone notice how many Asians were killed in this game or was it just me?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
