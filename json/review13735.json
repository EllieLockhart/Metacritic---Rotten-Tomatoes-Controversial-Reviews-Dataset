Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it were just a movie\\, then it would be good. But as a Star Wars film\\, it fails in spades to give the long time and even short-term fans of the franchise any cathartic release. When fans are saying they would rather have Jar-Jar Binks come back than this mess\\, you know something has definitely gone wrong.","true":true}
