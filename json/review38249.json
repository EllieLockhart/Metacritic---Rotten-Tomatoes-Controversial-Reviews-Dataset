Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The way they presented the knowledge of secrets was just absurd. They didn't tell us who the hell snoke was and just killed him off completely diluting the importance of the character\\, that is\\, it would have been fine to kill off snoke but not before giving us insight into who the hell he was. And then worst of all\\, the addressing of Rey's parents was just the saddest cop out ever for any secret that they drove us to wonder and question for so long. Her parents were \\\"nobodies\\\"... wow ok so this movie is nothing\\, Rey doesn't matter\\, snoke doesn't matter\\, and apparently Star Wars doesn't matter... so disappointed with this last installment\\, just wanted to cry. Star Wars\\, why did you let me down (sad face).","true":true}
