Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible...badly miss timed humor\\, plot holes you could drive a truck through\\, Rey's terrible character development\\, Lukes character has been completely butchered - doesn't seem to care that his good fri nd Han is dead\\, force ghosts now able to control lightning\\, Snokes interesting character wasted with no back story\\, etc etc etc....I could go on.\\nA huge mess of a film can't see how they can come back from this for the next movie.  Very disappointing.","true":true}
