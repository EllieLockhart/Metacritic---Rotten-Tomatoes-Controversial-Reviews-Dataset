Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER FREE REVIEW... 12\/15\/17\\nI'll just say this. We aren't children watching this stuff for the first time. It's not 1980\\, it's not The Empire Strikes Back\\, the tech is so vast now it's bound to be different. Im not sure I understand the point of view from the \\\"critics\\\". It's not like this was episode 1\\, 2\\, or 3... I'm sure I could try to pick it apart\\, but I'm just not going to do that. This movie for me was easily the best thing I've seen since episode 6. \\nI will be seeing this again today\\, and if you haven't seen it or are on the fence about it\\, just go\\, you'll thank yourself later...\\nSo from this critic it gets a solid 10\\, I mean how could the ?? Tomatometer ?? be wrong (their score 93%) I don't believe it is.","true":true}
