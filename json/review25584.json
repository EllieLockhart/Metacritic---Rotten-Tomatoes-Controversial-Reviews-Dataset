Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a fan boi\\, but do enjoy a good film? Then it is most definitely worth parting with some of your hard earned cash to see this. On my own 'Star Wars O Meter' I would say this gave me nearly as much pleasure as the original Star Wars when I was 12!","true":true}
