Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rehashed writing\\, Bad lighting\\, not mysterious\\, Just seemed like nothing went into writing this movie just a cash grab from disney a star wars action film. Surviving outer space was stupid so was the girl laying by the open doors breathing where insulting to Sci Fi fans even tho Star Wars has never been Sci Fi they have never crossed the line as hard between science and Fantasy. R.I.P. Star Wars they should have called it Star Wars No Hope. I won't see another in a theater. The only complaint i Have about Rouge One is the lord of the rings bad guy.
