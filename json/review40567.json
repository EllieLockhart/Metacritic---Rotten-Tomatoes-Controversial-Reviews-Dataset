Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst plot and story ever for me in the star wars films . I have about a dozen reasons why this is the worst but I will give you three. 1st) How can some one with no training overthrow some one with alot of training. No matter what reason you give it is a crap idea and not realistic . Rey is the worts female character in the franchise. She is not relatable and realistic as a character and for its pro feminist agenda its even worse 2nd) Snoke the most powerful of the dark lords in his time\\, falls in two seconds to someone far weaker than him in the force and even if you could make the argument that Ren could over through him we do not know enough about snoke to make a great argument for or against.  3rd) The whole save the animals thing. I do not watch fantasy to get a dose of a reality to watch some ones propaganda on their political agenda. Whether it is reasonable or not.  If the producers puts one cent in their pockets of money made on this film while allowing that in the story they all a bunch bunch of hypocrites and nullifies their message.","true":true}
