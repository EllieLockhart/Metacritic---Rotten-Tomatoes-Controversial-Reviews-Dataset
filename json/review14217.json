Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it 1 star for being a not so bad sci-fi action movie. For the rest\\, it is an insult to star wars and the star wars franchise which does litterally only harm and no good. Ryan Johnson litterally raped star wars here\\, destroying every plotline that was established in the previous TFA and every single character or plotline that was left from the original triology.\\nIf youre a star wars fan\\, this movie will feel to you like a bag of trash wrapped in giftpaper\\, ribbon and all. The effects are amazing\\, but the story is rotten at its core\\, and its stench will be stuck in your nose way after you leave the theater. I cant start to imagine how the damage it  deals to the franchise can possibly be mended.\\n[SPOILERS] To be specific about a few points: The way Snoke was handled\\, Rey having no backstory at all\\, leia flying through space\\, the totally out of place jokes\\, the fanservice intended to sell toys\\, the subliminal (and not so subliminal) political messages\\, EVERYTHING about Luke Skywalker\\, etc. Just to name a few things that sucked.","true":true}
