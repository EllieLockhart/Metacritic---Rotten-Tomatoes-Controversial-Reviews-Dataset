Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is a really greatly written and directed movie\\, the only problem is the canto bight scenes that felt out of place from star wars. I feel like some of the decisions might either  anger or please fans. it completely changes star wars as it is the most unique star wars yet. I t seriously plays against your expectations so i suggest you should go in with 0 expectations. My 3rd favorite star wars film and possibly my favorite film of the year. BTW\\, haters\\, go screw off. I give this film 5 out of 5 just to aggregate you guys like you did with the people you aggregated for loving this movie.","true":true}
