In the end\\, everyone reconciled and just waited. But then the irreparable happened\\, a lot of videos from the game were leaked\\, whole cutscenes\\, fights\\, etc. I think that this is the reason for all the misfortune that this game faced. For many people\\, torn scenes from the context gave them an erroneous opinion about the whole product. All this\\, of course\\, fueled the integration of LGBT people into the game (which\\, in fact\\, does not matter much in the game)\\, and this topic has been very problematic in recent years. I am sure that the studio and Neil knew that this would happen and consciously took a risk. However\\, Ellie and her story have been crushingly criticized. I hope that in the future\\, people will learn to criticize a product only after they are fully acquainted with it.\r\rI have been waiting for the game for 5 years and for me it is not just a hobby\\, it is a personal story into which I was drawn. And I waited\\, waited patiently\\, but then leaks that were impossible to get away from (social networks\\, YouTube and everything else is an integral part of life now). And it really ruined my impressions\\, I was very upset. But despite this\\, I enjoyed this incredible story for 30 hours. About which I will say only a little. The plot is not something unique\\, we have already seen this in world cinema\\, but the presentation itself and how we learn the history from all sides makes this game beautiful. And it is heartbreaking\\, however\\, all as promised to us\\, only pain\\, revenge and a circle of violence.\rEveryone will always find cons for themselves\\, but really something that spoils the game is not here. If Naughty Dog were asked what I didn\u2019t like in the game\\, I would only remember about the NPC that sometimes interferes with passing and about enemies who do not always act logically.\rSumming up\\, I want to say that I am grateful to the studio\\, to every person who worked on this incredible game. I do not stop watching a video about development\\, listening to podcasts\\, and watching early Art in Istagram. Thank you very much for everything.\rDespite the huge damage from the spoilers\\, I can still say that the game broke my heart and in the end I cried. I think that was exactly what was intended so that the story of Ellie would destroy not only her\\, but also us\\, the last of us.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
