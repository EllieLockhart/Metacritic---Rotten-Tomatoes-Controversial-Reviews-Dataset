Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was excited about the movie until i went to see it on opening weekend. I have been a fan of Star Wars ever since i was a little kid. I was obsessed with the prequels as a teenager. The forced identity politics in this movie and terrible story telling completely ruined Star Wars for me.","true":true}
