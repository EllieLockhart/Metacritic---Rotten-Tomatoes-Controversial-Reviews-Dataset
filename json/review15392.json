Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved everything about it! The action\\, the new characters\\, all the twists\\, and the storyline\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is now my favorite Star Wars movie. I don\u2019t care if people say that Rian ruined it. He did a great job of directing!","true":true}
