Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasn\u2019t terrible but I guess that\u2019s not really a compliment. There were a lot of new characters that felt forced and some of the plot choices annoyed me(flying through space?!?). There were good parts though and the last two movies were good so I still have hope.","true":true}
