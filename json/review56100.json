Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much was wrong with this movie.\\n1: every episode to date was separated by TIME\\, this episode was not.\\n\\n2: killing off major characters WITHOUT REMORSE ie admiral Akbar\\,  Snoke.\\n\\n3: your political tones ie BASING CAPITALISM AND UPLIFTING FEMINISM throughout the film was distasteful\\, to a nauseating level where I am only going to see the film once\\, I saw the last Jedi 3 times and rogue one twice. If you are going to hide political undertones HIDE THEM DO NOT WEAR THEM LIKE A BADGE.\\n       \\n4. Honestly not going to watch\/BUY ANYTHING RELATED TO STARWARS till you(Disney) fixes this. That means you screwed up and episode 8 gets fixed NOT EPISODE 9 but episode 8 ie scrap the movie redo it all.\\n\\n                    RID MY LIPS #MAKESTARWARSGREATAGAIN.","true":true}
