Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why some people are disappointed with this movie\\, it's not a toy-shuffling fan fest. It's an actual deep story where\\, like in any war\\, there are casualties. Luke redeeming himself was amazing\\, The plot was made much more human and Rey no longer is a Mary Sue\\, but an actual person. This movie could've been an empty re-hash like TFA was\\, but it wasn't it was so much more\\, and so much better\\, so much more emotional. amazing fighting choreography (yes crybabies\\, this isn't an attack of the clones battle royale) for the few important fights that are in there. unfulfilled backstories were fleshed out\\, plot holes closed. The movie is long (the Canto Bight sequence shouldn't have been in there) but it's not boring (like the prequels.)\\n\\nThere is a reason why Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars movie\\, and Rian Johnson knows it. It's a 2\\,5 hour roller-coaster where we welcome\\, say goodbye\\, cheer and cry.","true":true}
