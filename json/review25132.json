Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never has a movie split my soul in two. It's been three days since I've seen it. Twice on one day. I still don't know if I love it or if I hate it. I love the visuals\\, the OST and the acting of the lead roles. Carrie Fisher in specific\\, I found her acting in TFA a little awkward\\, but in TLJ she's back at it. I hated a few scenes\\, some storylines\\, the fact they ruined some other storylines which had a great potential.\\nIt's hard to review this movie without spoiling. It really is.\\nJust go and see it. It is not bad. Is it great? Maybe. Maybe not. I'm still not sure.\\nThanks.","true":true}
