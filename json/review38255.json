Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The web tells us that great\\, otherwise unforeseen opportunities often come from risk-taking. This movie takes many. Most land. If a story is to survive the ages and mean something then sometimes it has to break new ground. Many will tell you that this movie took too many risks\\, messed with cannon too much. It was just the kind of story this franchise needed. With J.J. doing viii we'll be back in safe territory soon enough. But this grand story does a great job shaking thing up\\, surprisingly honoring the prequels and finding a new take on the story\\, I can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
