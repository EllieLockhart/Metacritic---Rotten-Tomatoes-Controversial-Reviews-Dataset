{"101487":116828,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Does Rian Johnson just hate Star Wars\\n\\nI'm sad I have to take time to write this. The opinions aren't as split as they appear. Critics are probably not paid off by Disney. They're scared. If they ever want a better job- to get hired at ABC\\, ESPN\\, FOX\\, Pixar\\, Lucasfilm\\, Marvel\\, etc it would be better not to have badmouthed the company. Moving on to why this movie actually sucks\\, and no it's not just all in the former fans' heads.\\n\\n1.All the people in the galaxy are just chillin\\, apparently.\\nThe rebels are fighting the New Empire continually\\, and everyone else is just out there\\, not being saved or bothered. So what are they fighting for? There's no point to what's going on. \\n\\n2. They runnin outta gas\\nThat's the crisis\\, resulting in the slowest\\, dumbest chase scene ever.\\n\\n3. Rey has no character. She never has to make a decision. Luke did many times: do I end my training prematurely to save my friends? Do I give in to the emperor in hopes he'll let my friends go? Do I give in to vader in hopes he'll show a good side? Rey also doesn't have any challenges or weaknesses. That's not a character\\, nor is it remotely interesting. What's more annoying\\, she preaches to other characters because she's so perfect. Kylo Ren is the secret protagonist. He has to make difficult choices\\, even if we have no backstory for them. He has to decide whether or not to kill his father\\, mother\\, Rey\\, and Snoke. The plot moves forward sometimes as a result of his actions. Rey is just along for the ride\\, looking surprised most of the time.\\n\\n4. What made Kylo so evil?\\n\\\"Darkness rose within him\\\" is the answer we get. So why is he bad? Cuz darkness.\\n\\n5. The big bad villain of two films is killed\\, and we still don't know who he is.\\nHe did have some epic lines though: \\\"No one can destroy me.\\\" *dies*\\n\\n6. Ackbar is gone\\, just like that. He was gone before he was gone\\, because he got replaced by the purple haired lady. I love when our older American actresses get work\\, but that character didn't need to be there\\, and the warrior's death could have been Ackbar's\\, a fan favorite\\, instead of him dying offscreen and explained away in one line of dialogue.\\n\\n7. Leia came back.. Why?\\nSo she could be in a coma for an hour\\, and then let Poe make the decisions. But first\\, Kylo decides not to kill her\\, she's blasted anyway\\, but wait\\, she floats back in\\, but oh no\\, just in a coma. Back and forth and wasting time. The whole movie in a nutshell.\\n\\n8. Rey and Finn are banal and ordinary. They have been respectively abandoned at a young age or kidnapped\\, and then left for dead or raised by an evil regime.  These should be extremely quirky and damaged people\\, but instead they're totally fine and well adjusted. What's worse while they should have no skills\\, they can do anything put in front of them right away. The running theme seems to be don't work hard. Anyone can just wake up a Jedi\\, why train?\\n\\n9. So freaking long. 6 acts to dismantle everything. At least the original saga doesn't go down easy.\\n\\n10. Our original beloved characters are in the film only to bring old people to the theater\\, and are only used as conflict to subvert the intentions of the new characters. Luke is only there to be in Rey's way. Leia stalls Poe\\, and they teach them important lessons like 'don't be such a hero\\, and don't work hard.'\\n\\n11. Recycled Degobah\\, Hoth\\, and Emperor's chamber sequences. STILL rehashing stuff. At least George tried new things in the prequels. He put his heart into them and took chances. I've always respected him and now we really miss him. \\n\\nIn the end\\, Johnson thought he was too cool for school\\, saying he's killing the past to start anew. All he did was upturn everything that was already built\\, rendering it pointless. It's amazing Disney let it happen. Maybe he saw JJ's ungodly catastrophe of crowd pleasing nonsense and decided to try and sink this ship once and for all\\, saving us from a long and painful death of the franchise.","true":true}
