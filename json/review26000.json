Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not just a bad Star Wars Movie\\, but just a bad movie in general.  Hollow characters\\, terrible plot holes\\, horrible story telling\\, but the worst offense is just how pointless the entire ordeal is.  It's as if the director was actively trying to piss off fans of this series.  I hated this Nihilistic take on the star wars mythos.","true":true}
