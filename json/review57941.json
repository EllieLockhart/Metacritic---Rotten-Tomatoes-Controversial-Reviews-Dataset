Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is wrong with people?  This movie is is a blast and is \\\"fine\\\" at worst.  The movie has truly fantastic photography and production design.  It has its faults\\, but they only really detract from the movie if you want them too.  I was perfectly content with TFA but I thought it felt flat\\, and TLJ renewed my interest in the new storyline.  The red and white contrast the film uses as its signature is something that is actually truly unique.  Carrie Fisher and Mark Hammil have a decent amount of screentime but aren't given as much to actually do as many people were hoping\\, but their performances were fantastic.  The story is easy to follow even if it comes closer to more standard Doctor Who corny territory at times.  It was surpising that the story explored themes covered extensively in the EU and TCW\\, but have never been acknowledged on screen\\, so it was really nice being reminded of the old EU stories I enjoyed just a few years ago.  It has a few flaws\\, but its little if anything that Star wars hasn't done beofre.  If anything\\, its guilty of leaning on some of Star Wars' dardinal sins a bit too much.  Overall\\, its a wonderfully fresh take on the new storyline.  It really only needed about 90 of its 160 minutes\\, but generally if one doesn't want to be distracted by the flaws\\, they won't be.","true":true}
