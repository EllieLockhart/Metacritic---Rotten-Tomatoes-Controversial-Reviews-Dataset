Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS*\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n>\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n-Kylo and Rey's force connection and discussions; interesting\\, although they kept interrupting them with humor that seemed out of place.\\n-The action; pretty cool action scenes\\n-Popcorn movie feel; I'm not terribly annoyed I saw this in a theater\\n-the hacker; Benecio del Toro's characters' brief musings on war and profiteering were interesting.\\n-Some of the humor; they used too many gags\\, but some were quite funny\\n-The acting\\, in general\\, is pretty good. Daisey Ridley\\, and\\, especially\\, Adam Driver\\, are fantastic.\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\n-The Kylo\/Rey payoff; it felt lazy. The whole movie builds towards letting go of the past\\, and almost hints at a point where the jedi\\, sith\\, rebels\\, and empire are forgotten\\, and something new\\, that comes in the grey area\\, arises. But nope. Wasted opportunity\\n-Idiocy; The leaders of both sides\\, and Poe and Amdiral Holdo are particularly idiotic\\, to the point of breaking suspension of disbelief.\\n-Rey and BB-8 are still far too Mary Sue like\\, particularly BB-8 in this one.\\n-New characters we don't get invested in; Rose and Admiral Holdo felt forced\\, introduced too fast to develop character attachments.\\n-The timeline; it makes no goddamn sense; and who the fuck is funding the first order. The empire\\, I get it\\, they usurped the galactic republic\\, with its massive population and giant economy. But the republic was back\\, so who the hell is giving this imperial offshoot the money to build supermassive capital ships and star system killing death star bases the size of planets?\\n-Disjointed; no real payoff\\, feels like one long chase seen\\n-Good thing Rose\\, a random republic mechanic\\, could deduce the method and countermeasure to a never before seen imperial system of hyperspace tracking\\n-Plot holes: big enough to drive a super star destroyer through.\\n-Wasting characters like captain Phasma...again.\\n\\nTHE UGLY:\\n-Luke; as Mark Hamill himself has stated\\, this character got a terrible treatment in this movie\\, and that breaks from everything Luke had been built up to be.\\n-Incongruity; While The Force Awakens was clearly designed to let anyone continue the Star Wars story afterwards\\, one would think at least a FEW of the important questions would be answered\\, other than potentially who Rey's parents were. Its very\\, very obvious that the same person who made TLJ did not make TFA\\n-The entire Finn\/Rose subplot and Casino world seen could be cut with no drop off in quality of the film. It was simply a place to try and make a clumsy (and alltogether nonsensical) political statement.\\n-Misleading; The exploration of Jedi mythos and morality was just about absent\\, reduced to two scenes. Given the trailers\\, this feels like a massive deception\\n-leias Mary Poppins moment\\n\\nOVERALL:\\n-It wasn't terrible\\, but it was also far from good. Easily the weakest of any Star Wars flick not containing Jar Jar Binks or Hayden Chistensen. Over-complicated\\, it loses its way\\, and pays off little to none of the series new topics and questions raised by TFA.\\n\\nI never thought I'd say this\\, but I'm glad Michael Bay is back to direct Episode 9.","true":true}
