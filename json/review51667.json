Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A delight to the senses. Diving into deeper sentiments from extended universe ideology\\, The Last Jedi paves the path for the future of Star Wars\\, and an entire universe full of potential. Cinematically\\, it is over two hours of gorgeous shots\\, perfectly tailored acting\\, and subtle writing paired with SW witicism and breathtaking soundtracks. Finally\\, there is an air of mysticism to the force once more\\, making it feel uncharted; a beautiful discovery waiting to be learned and harnessed once again. After having watched it once\\, I am beyond thrilled to see it again\\, and to dive deeper into the minute details that Rian Johnson delivers so perfectly. One of my favorite movies to date.","true":true}
