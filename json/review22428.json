Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Left more questions than answers for me than Force Awakens.  It didn't really do it for me\\, seem like they just trying to mop away all the old characters and force the new ones on us.  A lot of lore breaking items in the movie\\, the movie don't seem to follow this timeline whatsoever. A lot of strong female characters\\, I think it's imbalance\\, and not enough strong male characters in the movie.  Everyone seem to be from the United Kingdom in Star Wars. Didn't really answer much about Snoke character\\, he died to easily.  Interesting how Luke Skywalker went to hell and back to save his father but so easily willing to kill his nephew over a thought.","true":true}
