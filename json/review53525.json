Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining but infuriating!  Before I even talk about all the problems in this movie\\, it pretends Episode 7 never happened.  The small First Order is now the galatic Empire.  The Republic\\, who had galatic control\\, is now all of a sudden the Rebels.  WHAT HAPPENED!?  Kylo Ren going to train? Nope!  Luke going to find the lost tomes of the Jedi and leaving a map in case he was needed? Nope\\, he went there to die... what map!?  The entire movie plays it safe.  Teasing a potential amazing movie at every turn\\, but refusing to sacrifice a character or their personality to make it.  This whole thing felt pointless.  And Ray... I HATE RAY!  She is the most bland character in the movie who can do absolutely anything because she's so amazing without any training.  She can summed up in a scene where she knock over a rock that tumbles down and destroys the native people's stuff in a 'comedy' scene... where they pan back to her just staring that blank stupid stare.  No 'sorry'.  No embarrassment.  Just the same stupid stare she gives the whole movie.  This movie is laughably bad.  Entertainingly bad in every decision the makers of this movie made.  Mystery Science Theater Material for sure!","true":true}
