Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie spent too much time with Luke failing to help and not letting us know why. CG is fine as usual\\, but the plot line is weak with no advancement in the story line. I was 16 when The New Hope was released. I love a good Sci-fi movie\\, unfortunately this wasn't it.","true":true}
