Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor felt out of place and moments that could have been powerful and emotional were ruined by actors being themselves and not the characters they were playing. There were still great moments though\\, twists and turns that I wouldn't have expected\\, and an extremely satisfying ending. Those things just couldn't overcome the out of place humor.","true":true}
