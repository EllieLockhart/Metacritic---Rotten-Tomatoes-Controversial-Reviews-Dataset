Well\\, I was wrong... I loved every bit of TLOU 2\\, and I couldn't stop playing until I got to the end. Completed the game in 3 days\\, enjoying every detail of it.

I understand why it is divisive\\, the story isn't trying to please the player's expectations. Actually it is quite the contrary. Everything is a huge mess\\, characters are as disoriented as we are\\, they don't know if they're doing the right thing. Ellie is inconsolable and it's heartbreaking. Of course\\, the game is emotionally heavy ; you find yourself crying\\, laughing\\, at tense quite often.\r\rIt isn't perfect though. I was playing on the PS4 Pro and the console is starting to show its weaknesses regarding resolution and details. Sometimes it is blurry and they use this sort of film grain hiding some imperfections. It didn't bother me actually. I liked it\\, it gave it a special sheen.\r\rWith that being said\\, the game still looks amazing and it is a real pleasure to explore all the carefully created environments. Grass\\, leaves\\, light reflections\\, cracks on the walls\\, everything is a delight to look at.\rThe music and sound effects are top notch\\, my expectations were high coming from the first game : here again\\, they didn't disappoint. Voice acting is where the game shines in my opinion. It feels real\\, it feels rough.\r\rOverall\\, the world feels very believable. Some choices of the writers change deeply the gameplay and it's refreshing. I couldn't tell what they are without revealing key points of the story\\, which proves how much gameplay and story are intertwined.\rThen I have to say that the game makes a point to be inclusive : everyone is represented. Women\\, asians\\, jews\\, black\\, you name it. Well\\, at times\\, I had the weird impression they were forcing it a bit\\, which I could not really comprehend. It's like they were on a mission to make videogames more inclusive\\, and I respect that : it's great news for this industry. But it will take more than one game to do it\\, and you shouldn't bruteforce the inclusiveness into your game. Otherwise\\, it could be detrimental of other aspects of your game\\, which fortunately isn't the case with TLOU 2.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
