Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the wort excuse for a Star Wars movie I've ever seen...just terrible...everything has already been said so there's that.","true":true}
