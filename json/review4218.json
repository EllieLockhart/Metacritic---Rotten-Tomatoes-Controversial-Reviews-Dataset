Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst entry into Star Wars canon. \\n\\nDespite the sometimes awe inspiring visual effects\\, the film features some of the worst characters and writing in a series that created Jar Jar Binks. \\nKylo Ren often repeats\\, \\\"let the past die\\, kill it if you must.\\\" And this movie attempts to do just that: breaking classic characters\\, retconning classic arcs and ignoring previous films.\\n\\nRian Johnson has been praised for \\\"subverting expectations \\\" and in a way\\, he does. For example\\, I expected to enjoy this film. He sure subverted that expectation.","true":true}
