Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is such a bad star wars movie. I can't even understand how someone would like it that has any understanding of the sw movies that came before.  There is no need to elaborate on all the problems with the movie as they are well documented with other reviews.  I am a star wars fan that has passed this passion on to my two little girls.  It is sad that I don't have any interest in continuing to do this.  How does Disney not understand Luke Skywalker's character arc?  It is Luke Skywalker!!!!  People understand that he might have made mistakes along the way and that would create an interesting journey.  The decisions the character makes are incoherent and don't compute with what we know about the character.  How they messed up this character is just a piece of how they messed up this franchise.  Wow.... I still can't believe how smart people could make this movie...  Still in shock......The interesting thing is to see the reach of Disney's power in controlling press etc....  Wow this movie stinks......","true":true}
