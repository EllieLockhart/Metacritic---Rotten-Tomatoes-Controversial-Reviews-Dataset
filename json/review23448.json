Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED THE FILM. The best since Empire Strikes Back. I really like how the movie surprised me with things i would have never expected. And think Rian took big risks\\, but the payoff was wonderful. I can't wait to see de next one.","true":true}
