Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst of the entire Star Wars franchise. Rain Johnson needs to be kept away from the series. Bad dialogue\\, slapstick comedy\\, bizarre edits and cuts\\, anti-climactic fights\\, a terrible side plot with Finn that felt like a Harry Potter movie... it\u2019s not good. The Rey\/Luke\/Ben story was ok but the rest leaves you very disappointed. ","true":true}
