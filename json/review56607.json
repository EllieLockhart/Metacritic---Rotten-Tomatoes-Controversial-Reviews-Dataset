Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is not only an underwhelming addition to the beloved franchise\\, which throws out many of the plot elements that made its predecessor so interesting\\, it is also a poorly written and directed film in a wider sense. \\n\\nMultiple plot lines which pad this film's bloated runtime have zero consequence on the overall story - with two major side plots having so little effect on the film the major events would have remained the same if those sequences had been cut entirely. \\n\\nTime and again\\, emotional moments are undercut with poor humour that feels out of place even in this post-Abrams trilogy\\, or they have no emotional weight to them because something is revealed or changed at the last moment which robs them of their impact. \\n\\nThe crying shame is that somewhere in this laborious 152 minute slog\\, is the core of a great film\\, which could have served as a fantastic skeleton for Episode 9 thematically as well as in specific plot points. \\n\\nBut unfortunately we are left with a poorly constructed effort which fails to build upon the mystery of Episode 7\\, throws out much of what made that film great\\, and fundamentally changes the core beliefs of characters we have known and loved for decades.","true":true}
