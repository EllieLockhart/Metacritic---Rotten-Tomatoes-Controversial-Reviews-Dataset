Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Barely any action\\, bad acting. The 3 people i went with fell asleep duringthe movie. Unbelievale how they are destroying this series i loved. They need to make sure they fit their racial and woman quota and dont worry about the plot or about any fighting scenes. 152 minutes runtime with 8 minutes of saber fighting? So what is star wars now? Itsf full of scenes and characters that dont matter. The black guy had no significance in the movie\\, yet had the most time on screen. Dont waste your money and support movies like this. With 800 million dollar budget thats the best they could do? Stop grading star wars with a curve and actually criteque them for their dismal efforts. 100$ that the next star wars will tank and end the series\\, no one will contiue tobpay to watch these lackluster films. The only character they have right is the new orders new supreme.                    leader.","true":true}
