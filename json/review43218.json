Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie was not in line with any previous films before it in terms of character development\\, plot\\, force lore and legecy of heros from previous films\\, books and animations. The obvious social messages were up front and center instead of used as undertones tactfully as in previous films. Just so many bad things to list. Great visual effects and tidbits of nostalgia. Terrible movie and story telling.","true":true}
