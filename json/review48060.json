Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While Star Wars the Last Jedi takes many risks with the Star Wars franchise\\, it provides a solid experience that takes the franchise in new and fresh directions!  While there are some pacing issues\\, the overall movie is wonderful.  Some Star Wars fans may not like the film for been too different\\, but I think that change is necessary to keep the franchise fresh and unexpected.","true":true}
