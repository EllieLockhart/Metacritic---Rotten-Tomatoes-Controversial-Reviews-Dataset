{"101487":163548,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-03","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"pros:\\n- Looks amazing.\\n- it was nice seeing the original characters again\\, despite how poorly they were treated.\\n\\nCons:\\n- breaks cannon in so many ways that it would take up to much space to list.\\n- ruins all the old characters as well as the new which blows my mind\\, i understand their desire to wipe out the old characters but to ruin their new characters as well is insanity.\\n- Pointless sub plots that serve no purpose at all.\\n- rose and haldo\\, god awful characters.\\n- i like seeing women in star wars but basically the entire bridge crew and every leader\/officer was female while the men were down played and made to look foolish and weak and it felt like forced sexism. \\n- Luke drinking milk from a space seahorse cow thing.\\n- since when was fuel a factor in star wars?\\n- weaponized hyperspace\\, nice looking scene but it creates plot holes in every movie past\\, present and future.\\n- fighter bombers removed for the worst assault craft ever created in a sci-fi. Those bombers make 0 sense. They are slow\\, weak\\, large targets\\, carry bombs that ignite other bombs when ignited\\, drop bombs (in space).\\n- yoda looked terrifying and acted like he did in empire when he was toying with luke instead of actually like the real yoda.\\n- phasma wasted\\, she was freaking awesome and you gave her less screen time than that obnoxious haldo character.\\n- snoke dead\\, no knights of ren\\, infact everything set up from the force awakens was thrown out the window. Rian forgot that this is part 2 of 3 and did his own thing as if it was a stand alone movie.\\n- as above\\, it ignored every star wars movie that came before it.\\n- jokes\\, too many awful badly timed scooby doo jokes ruining scenes that could have been good.\\n- bb-8 being more effective than the terminator\\, hes a mech droid not a warrior droid... tone him down a bit.\\n- porgs\\, cute and all and i did like them but they took them too far.\\n- the aliens\\, where are all the original alien species from the cannon? why is every alien new? all the new aliens look almost the same as well\\, same colours\\, same weird beedy eyed yak faced things.\\n- rey downloading the force instead of learning it.\\n- leia poppins.\\n- it breaks the 'unbreakable' laws of space... eg. losing momentum\\, not getting sucked out into space\\, not dying in seconds while exposed to space. It's like having a submarine with a hole in it that doesn't flood.\\n- Kylo flying into the hanger bay while the shields were up\\, since when has that been a thing? Revenge of the sith they had to take out the shields to enter the hanger.\\n- finn and rey had no time together.\\n- rose saving finn\\, that whole scene is just terrible and ruined finns moment.\\n- bigger isn't better\\, everything tries to be bigger\\, better and stronger than what we have seen before.\\n- movie rips off empire strikes back and return of the jedi\\, give us something new please.\\n- seeing ships in orbit and hearing them exit hyperspace from the planets surface.\\n- no emotionally memorable moments: \\nluke dying made me mad\\, it made no sense and was the worst hero death i have ever seen.\\nkylo vs luke was dull and was ruined by the fact luke didn't even show up in person.\\nrey and finn meeting up again... empty.\\nhaldo's sacrifice was meh\\, if you didnt make her such a jerk and made her likeable then her sacrifice would have meant more.\\nleia meeting luke again.. zzz.\\n- Music sucked\\, john williams is a genius but this movie just didn't make proper use of his talents. \\n\\nBasically the people behind this movies creation have never seen star wars before or thought it was a good idea to destroy the past and start a new instead of building on the amazing foundations laid down for them.\\n- weak weak weak story and plot\\, eg first order takes over the galaxy in what a week?\\n- there are too many cons.\\n\\nthere are plenty more cons but i think that sums up how bad this movie really is at the core. look beyond the visuals and you'll see how bad it really is. It is so bad it is insulting to the fanbase and to anyone with any intelligence.","true":true}
