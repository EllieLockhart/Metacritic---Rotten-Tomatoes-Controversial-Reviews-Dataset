Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge disappointment\\, cringeworthy humor\\, constantly annoying creatures on screen who only exist for merchandising. Rey is a total Mary-Sue\\, Luke's legacy is completely destroyed\\, Finn's subplot is pointless and boring and Leia has superpowers for some reason? Snoke and Rey's powers aren't explained at all\\, which proves the writers were improvising and don't have a clue what they are doing.","true":true}
