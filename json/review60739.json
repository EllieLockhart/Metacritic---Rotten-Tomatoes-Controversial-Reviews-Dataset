The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The negative reviews are so wrong! This game is a masterpiece! I hate SJWs\\, first of all\\, and I hate the agenda. That being said\\, those things are in everything now. There\u2019s no getting away from it. This game has bits of that and the leakers seem to take great pride in revealing only those things. They didn\u2019t mention the heartfelt flashback to a museum as astronaut Ellie. They didn\u2019t mention the REASON that Abby killed Joel. Playing as Abby was\\, at first\\, off putting. I didn\u2019t like it. I was mad at the creators for making me do it. Then something happened. I started to see things through her eyes. I started to care about Abby and her side. I\u2019ll admit that it took a little while\\, even after finding out that her father was the Dr that Joel killed to save Ellie. Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, I hate that Joel dies! It was brutal to watch. It hurt. On the same token\\, I can understand that Abby is not an evil **** She was getting revenge for her father.I keep seeing reviewers saying there\u2019s no story. They have not played the game. Period. Nobody can play the full game and say there\u2019s no story. There is tons of story\\, great story! You just might not like it\\, so say there\u2019s no story. The story is just as amazing as part one. Joel is there. He\u2019s in the the flashbacks. Ellie finds out what he did at the hospital and hates him for it. She cuts him out of her life and shortly after he is killed. She is ridden with guilt and that\u2019s what drives her vengeance do much. She let him down.Stop listening to the bad reviews. You may not like it because of this or that\\, but you owe yourself to give it a chance. You can tell that the creators put countless hours of blood\\, sweat and tears into this game. They poured their souls into it. You can feel it throughout. Don\u2019t miss out on this experience just because thousands of fake players say it\u2019s bad. Chances are\\, you\u2019ll love it!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
