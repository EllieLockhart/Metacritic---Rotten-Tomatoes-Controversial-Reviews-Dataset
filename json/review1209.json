Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A pointless story that serves more as propaganda than a respectable Star Wars movie. From vast amounts of wasted time on storylines and characters that don't move the plot forward\\, to the vastly unbelievable combat scenes\\, this is the worst of the Star Wars movies. It barley passes as a B-movie interpretation.","true":true}
