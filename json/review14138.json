Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want solid evidence that this website and critics have been bought and paid for by Disney\\, look no further than the Last Jedi. Look at the disparity between the critic and audience score. The film was excruciatingly bad. It essentially mocks the mythos of Star Wars\\, turns Luke into a jerk\\, and anything that was not horrible was a rehash from previous Star Wars that did it far better. Phantom Menace at least had Darth Maul. There is nothing redeeming about this film. It ruined any intrigue set up in the Force Awakens. You have been warned.","true":true}
