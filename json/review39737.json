Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie. I'm confused by all the negative fan reviews. I consider myself a huge Star Wars fan I love the stories and characters. I also see when there are problems in the previous films. The Phantom Menance wasn't very good. However this movie is awesome\\, great story\\, twists\\, turns\\, and new characters. Don't listen to all the crazy fans that pan it because it's not a remake of the previous movies.  Those overzealous fans who give it horrible reviews they are the people that suck all the air out of rooms at parties and need to speak with therapists.","true":true}
