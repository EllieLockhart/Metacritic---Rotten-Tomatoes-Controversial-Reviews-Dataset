Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally I liked the movie with the exception of the Finn and Rose adventure that spanned for about 30 minutes. I liked how Rian Johnson took a risk\\, but obviously I can see why some people are disappointed. ","true":true}
