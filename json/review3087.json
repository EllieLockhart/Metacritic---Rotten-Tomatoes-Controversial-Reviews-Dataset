Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad story telling\\, random events that went nowhere. I can't even say it was weak character development\\, it was more like bi-polar characters. Campy dialog really didn't give this cast much to work with as well.","true":true}
