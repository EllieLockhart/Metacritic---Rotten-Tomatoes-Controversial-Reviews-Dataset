Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was a great Star wars movie.  I loved it. Lots of character development and surprises.  Better than force awakens..   And beautifully shot   I think people are just not understanding it.  or don't take time to think.  I love star wars all my life and this movie really spiced it up for me!.  I'm looking forward to this directors trilogy he's working on.","true":true}
