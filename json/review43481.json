Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a very hard movie to watch. I love Star Wars\\, but the humor at first wasn't funny - this wasn't a Marvel movie - and overall I just felt let down\\, not because of fan hopes or theories that didn't pan out\\, but because it was just a really bad movie in general even if it wasn't Star Wars. It's only doing well because it is Star Wars\\, but once word gets out we'll see how it goes. I hope Disney is listening and can salvage whatever is left of this mess. I would like to have watched a good movie\\, not whatever this was.","true":true}
