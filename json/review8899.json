Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forty years culminated in ... nothing. I have not enough words to explain the disappointment I felt when I watched this series of inconsistencies. The last Jedi\\, it will be for me also the last time I spend money\\, time and love in this lack of respect for the fans.","true":true}
