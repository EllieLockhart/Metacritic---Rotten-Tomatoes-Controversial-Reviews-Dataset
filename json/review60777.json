The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"To start I want to say clearly that this is NOT a review that targets naughty dog or other **** they are saying. if it was just harassment\\, I wouldn't write that many words into it and only say *** this game.  But\\,  it is my personal and sincere opinion on this game. First of all\\, I want to say that as a big fan of TLOU1\\, this sequel is a missed opportunity.  it is clear purpose was NOT to make the player enjoys a game. it was clearly made to shove SJW ideology into our mouth.\r\rpeople on the other side says that everyone who rates it low is homophobic. here I defend myself and all the others by saying that this is not what makes us HATE the game. if their idea was normal inside to context\\, I will say it's ok. but an entire game that focuses so much on the character's sexuality in a dangerous world were deaths are around every corner is ****.\r\rMore importantly\\, killing Joel in the most disrespectful way then force us to try to empathy the killer is just pure stupid. Don't get me wrong\\, I tried my best to give it a try. I truly tried to look through Abby eyes. but however i see it. i think she is just pure evil. trying to make her less evil by her being nice to dogs and trans kids haven't worked as they thought it will work. she and all her gangs are just unlikeable at all. I didn't care for anyone of them as much as I cared for Joel and Ellie. Then\\, he just kills Joel and makes Ellie lose everything in her life for a stupid typical un-complete revenge story.\r\rOne more note\\, in so much dangerous world\\, how can a 13 years kids think about his sexuality so much and believe that he needs to transform into a boy ?????? aggggh just make it believable that all I ask.\r\rto be fair\\, the graphics and the gameplay was so damn good\\, no other game will beat that level of details. I don't think it is a 4.5 game at all. but\\, as a response to nail when he has given us a big finger by killing our most beloved character and spitting on it and destroying Ellie's character. I will give him this review as a return. The gaming industry depends on the player's opinion\\, so if he doesn't care about his audience\\, then he deserves what he gets.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
