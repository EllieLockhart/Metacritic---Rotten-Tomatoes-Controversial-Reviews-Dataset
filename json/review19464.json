Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its the first time my son say is boring watching a star-wars movie he almost fall sleep on the movie i as a grown up feel the story but it fall short for me rogue one was really good not TLJ sorry","true":true}
