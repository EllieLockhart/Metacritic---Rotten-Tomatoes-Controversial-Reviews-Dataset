Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This next installment in the new Star Wars saga didn't necessarily live up to all the hype\\, but I think was better than many people thought. I liked the development between Rey and Kylo's characters (although the telepathic conversations were a little bizarre). The most disappointing part was the lack of real plot development as the First Order chases the Resistance throughout all of space for the majority of the movie. Some of the dialogue and scenes dragged a little. I wasn't disappointed by what happened to Luke; I felt they explained his motivations well. Could have done without Leia floating through space though. But BB-8 is badass and the best droid\\, and Porgs are super cute!","true":true}
