Those three things were awesome in this game! I was hesitant to purchase this game after reading the leaked spoilers\\, however  \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d is my favorite game of all time therefore I owe it to Naughty Dog to purchase Part 2. I will not go in depth since A lot of the things I want to talk about\\, a lot of reviews have already addressed them. I think I\u2019m in the minority when I say that playing as Abby is really fun. I love her character model because it\u2019s intimidating and she\u2019s honestly a bad@$$! I don\u2019t like the role she plays (NOT AT ALL) but I think it\u2019s Naughty Dogs fault for making a majority of the player community dislike her. What I\u2019m trying to say is that It sucked playing as the person that killed your favorite video game character of all time BUT I didn\u2019t really care much for the story after that event so I tried to close that out and just have fun with the gameplay. The Last of Us Part 2 was a terrible story compared to the first game which is why I\u2019m giving it such a low score. These games are pretty much defined by how good the story is and if the story is horrible then the game will pretty much be horrible as well. To finish it off I was extremely disappointed how this game turned out and really let down knowing that this is the sequel to my favorite game ever. Nonetheless I will always thank Naughty Dog for making \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and setting the standard that high!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
