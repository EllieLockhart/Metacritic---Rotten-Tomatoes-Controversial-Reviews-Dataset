Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers Alert!\\n\\nFor the very first time Star Wars had deeply disappoint me. Not even the prequels made so much damage...\\n\\nWhere to start?\\n\\nNo Jedi (especially Luke!) would never\\, ever EVER act like that! To quote Mark Hamill \\\"I fundamentally disagree with virtually everything you decided about my caracter.\\\"\\nThis movie did not only tarnish the movies before disney. It went against it's own prequel! (Star Wars - The force awakens)\\nHere is how:\\nRay's training? Does she even need any training?\\nWho are \\\"M'Ray Sue\\\" parents? It doesn't matter!\\nDo you know that moment were \\\"M'Ray Sue\\\" delivers the light saber to Luke? You know... The climax and bait for the movie itself? F****** it!\\nSnoke? The Super\\, Mega\\, Ultra\\, Hyper\\, Fantastic\\, Fabulous Villain? Not only nothing is explained about him\\, his past\\, how he got the bank to roll the First Order or even his motivation behind a full out war with the entire galaxy. But he dies like a newbie! I mean\\, how in the world a guy who supposedly teaches Kylo Ren how to stop freaking laser blasts in mid-air can not stop a force pushed light saber?\\nPoe Dameron was a hot shot ace pilot who saves the day right? Noooooooooooooooope! His a hot headed imbecil who cannot be trusted.\\nAnd the comic relief\\, FN-2187? You know\\, the First Order desertor and former \\\"African-Galaxyan\\\" janitor (who also have high level access tho every schematic of the First Order)... Well\\, they spend half an hour on a side story that adds absolutely nothing to the plot of the film! Oh yes! And they completly waste his moment of heroism!\\nCaptain Phasma? It looks like to me that they saw the general critique about her caracter and decided\\, lets just waste her caracter! Again!\\n\\nBeyond the contradictions there is the worst scene of the entire movie: The  superman Leia.\\n\\nThere is so much more to tell on the negative side of this movie that we could stay here all day long.\\n\\nBut hey! At the least the film's photography is great right!\\nGreat effects\\, great visuals...\\nThat's what matters right?\\n\\nAnd the money it's making...","true":true}
