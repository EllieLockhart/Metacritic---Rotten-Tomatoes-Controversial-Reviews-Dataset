Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent movie. Has some incredible acting\\, most notably Adam Driver as Kylo Ren\\, Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. The movie is visually stunning with some fantastic visual effects utilised in some of star wars's greatest battle scenes. the cinematography is also fantastic\\, with a more stylistic look thanks to Rian Johnson. The story is also fantastic with some very great and unpredictable twists\\, some of which are sure to be divisive. ultimately the only let down of the film is the Finn and Rose story arc which could have been chopped down or revised and reshot to have more significance. their is also one character that could have had a bit more development. The film also has some very good and intriguing additions to the force's mythos and lore that show some great progression in its powers whilst also being refreshing. One thing. Not everyone has to be significant in star wars remember this and you wont be disappointed!","true":true}
