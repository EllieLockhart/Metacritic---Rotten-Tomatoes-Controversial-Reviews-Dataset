Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand the point of the people who hated it. I also understand the points of the people who loved it. I just think it is unfair for either side to say the others arn't true starwars fans. I think everyone can be a fan. The one thing I think the movie didn't do so well is sequence. The Canto Bite sequence was unnecessary and distracted from the story. The movie didn't feel like an adventure. It was comprised of mostly action and gut wrenthcing moments. I hope the spin offs are more like the adventures we are used to.","true":true}
