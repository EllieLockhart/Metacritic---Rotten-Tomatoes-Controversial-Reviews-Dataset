Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was a different movie going experience. From incredible visuals then diving into a subpar story (including the unnecessary subplot halfway through the film)\\, The Last Jedi wowed with incredible fight scenes\\, beautiful vistas\\, and of course the adorable Porgs. The film dived even further into the Force\\, and what \u201cbalance\u201d truly is between the dark side and the light but I wasn't sold on it\\, though it was a bold move to address this. Star Wars has always been first and foremost a story of redemption and hope\\, and this film left you wondering if we would ever see either. This film also tore down many of the established ideas and direction of TFA\\, which was a considerable misstep and makes it evident that a roadmap was not created for this trilogy.","true":true}
