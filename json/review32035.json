Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*SPOILERS* I\u2019ve never written a review\\, but I feel compelled. The difference between TLJ and TFA is this for me: I felt pure joy\/sadness\/emotion during TFA and felt nothing during TLJ. I was numb. As weird as this sounds\\, I just didn\u2019t get that \u201cfeeling\u201d that all previous Star Wars films give me. JJ Abrams set up so many cool ideas and none of them paid off. Its like Rian came on\\, looked at JJs ideas\\, and said... nah\\, Im good. Lets kill Snoke and Luke and make Rey a nobody. Very disappointed. ","true":true}
