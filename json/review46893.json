Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went against in universe logic\\, killed character portraits that have been build up over the saga\\, plotline driven my outside political motivators\\, very poor dialogue\\, nonsensical scenes\\, very cheap humor breaks attention from dramatic moments and worse if all\\, they turned their back against the most loyal fan base in pop culture history. I hope disney learned their lesson after this catastrophe with the plummeting reviews and failure at the box office.","true":true}
