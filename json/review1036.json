Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another in the cash cow that is the Star Wars franchise.\\n\\nI watched all of the 6 first movies recently with my son and even though the three prequels could have been better\\, they were all original works which had merit.\\n\\n\u0093The Force Awakens\u0094\\, while full of plot holes and a fairly blatant ripoff of the first Star Wars movie\\, was fun to watch. This\\, by contrast\\, was weak in every way.\\n\\nI expected Skywalker\u0092s return to have some substance or drama\\, but really it just felt like having him there for the sake of it.\\n\\nThere was no real rhyme\\, reason\\, point or even fun in this film and I can\u0092t help but feel it was more concerned with ticking all the boxes of its politically correct checklist than bothering with a decent script.","true":true}
