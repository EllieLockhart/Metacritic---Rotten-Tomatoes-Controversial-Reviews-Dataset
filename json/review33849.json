Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"terrible pacing\\, weird plot holes\\, redundant characters taking up a lot of screen time\\, magic rey.  This movies was full of political messages\\, over representation of women in males roles\\, all of the men were evil or stupid\\, even the new rebel leader was a purple haired feminist.\\n\\nLeave that stuff out of star wars\\, it has no place there.  Otherwise it was just slapstick\\, awkward humour that just does not belong in a star wars movie\\, stupid cuddly creatures to trick kids into watching it and then buying the merchandise afterwards.\\n\\nThis movie really killed the franchise\\, its over.","true":true}
