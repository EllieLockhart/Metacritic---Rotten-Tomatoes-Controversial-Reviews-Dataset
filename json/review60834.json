The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"If I could score this game in a single word\\, i'd use the word \\\"Astonishing\\\"\rThere is up to 8 hours that I finished the game's history and i'm still wordless about how incredible well made it is. This game is one of the few games that can make you feel such a strong empathy for the antagonist of the game\\, and even more: It makes you not know how to feel about what is going on the game. In all the Ellie vs. Abby fights the game had I can only remember wanting them to stop fighting.\rEvery consequence\\, every move one of them makes towards the other\\, every single small piece of history seems to take you to the thinking: \\\"Is vengance really that important?\\\". Especially in the part where Ellie abandons Dina and JJ to finish what she had started.\rSo **** amazing!\r\rThis game tells de best history about vengance\\, forgiveness and consequence I have ever saw. It really brings out the message behind the phrase \\\"Vengance is like Salt Water: The more you drink it\\, the more thirsty you'll get\\\". And it goes further to make you see how deep the game goes: Even the secondary characters of it have theirs deepness and relevance to the game`s history.\rAnd not only the history: This game outdones his first part in gameplay\\, deepness and especially in the exploration and world design factor too.\rThis game is simply amazing\\, and worth every dolar spent on it. Even though many people will desagree and dislike the subverting expectations part of the game and the twists the history takes\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, for good or for bad. You'll either hate it or have one of the BEST EXPERIENCES you can have on gaming. The only way to know how much you'll like this game is playing it\\, and I highly suggest you to do so\u2026 Expand","true":true}
