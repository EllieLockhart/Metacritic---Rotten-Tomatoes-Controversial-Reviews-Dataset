Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi demonstrated that those tales don't have to be universally loved by audiences to find favor with critics.\\\"\\nThat does leave the question of what good are critics? Are they anything short of obnoxious\\, holier than thou\\, parasites attempting to feed themselves off of other people's creative efforts (poor as they are in this case)?\\nI will not spend time going over all problems with the writing and execution in this movie as they are glaringly obvious.\\nThe movie was a disappointment\\, however it's the critics that made me angry. But I guess any franchise that still finds any emotional response from it's tired\\, apathetic and brow beaten audience\\, is one to make the sweet\\, sweet sales. Well played Dysney\\, I despise yet respect you. But! I AM NOT BUYING A PORG!","true":true}
