Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the visuals and score were outstanding\\, it is clear that the director had no respect for the audience\\, the franchise or even basic writing principals.\\n\\nJuxtaposing serious a thought provoking moments with slapstick belonging in a spoof like Spaceballs\\, having pointless side plots\\, a half-baked suspicion plot\\, characters not communicating like they have ever met before\\, contrived force abilities\\, throwing away key characters unremorcefully\\, having simultaneous plots taking different amounts of time\\, failing to adhere to the Chekov's gun principle\\, ressurecting cpt phasma\\, introducing RKV weapons in a setting which has classically never had them (and for good reason - they make all space combat pointless)\\,  but worst of all - not taking itself seriously after establishing that it was a serious film.\\nFor these crimes against the artform\\, i relegate this movie to bottom of the trash pile\\, directly next to M N Shamalan's Avatar the ladt airbender movie.\\n\\nCongratulations on killing a 5 billion dollar franchise","true":true}
