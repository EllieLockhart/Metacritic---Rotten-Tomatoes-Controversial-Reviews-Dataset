Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I thoroughly dlisliked the film for the following reasons:  \\n\\n- Lots of plot holes (i.e. bombs being dropped onto a ship in space when there is not gravity or Luke complaining about not wanting to be found when left a map to where he was) \\n\\n-Odd and forced jokes (i.e. Luke mocking Rey for coming from Jakku or Poe making a joke about General Hux's mother.)\\n\\n- Male characters are presented as foolish and overzealous (Poe starting a coup against Holdo even though there was a larger plan to move personnel - Which he was never told about for some confusing\\, bizarre reason?!?) \\n\\n- Iconic characters were needlessly and anticlimactically killed off (Admiral Ackbar blown up randomly during a starship battle just for shock value) \\n\\n- Forced pairings between characters (A forced romance between Finn and Rose that lacked any chemistry and tension - despite the best efforts of the actors)  \\n\\n- Thinly written characters (It was still unclear who Snoke was before he died. No effort was made to explain who he was or why he was doing what he was doing\\, nor how he was able to establish the force connection between Rey and Kylo Ren.) \\n\\nThanks for reading my review\\, as brief as it was\\, and let me know if there is anything I have misrepresented or overlooked.
