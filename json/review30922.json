Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed after watching this at home last night.  Apart from the plot holes\\, bad space physics and indifferent writing and character use this was just a rehash of Empire Strkes Back in reverse.  Even down to an underwater Xwing. Watch it again and tell me it wasn't.  Spectre pulled off a fair better homage than this\\n\\nAnd when is Yoda going to go 'Wacca Wacca'?\\nDid anyone ask where Tinky Winky was now we have Poe?\\nGOLD stormtroopers?  Too much watching darleks perhaps?\\nWhy were Chewy\\, R2 and C3P0 even in the film?\\n\\nSo interesting I played Candy Crush while watching?","true":true}
