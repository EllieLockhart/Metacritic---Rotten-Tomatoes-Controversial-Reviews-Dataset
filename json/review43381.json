Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an amazingly awful movie.  Not just disappointing\\, it was really bad!  After thoroughly enjoying Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, I thought the franchise has flipped the scrip and moved on successfully from the prequels but this move did not hit a bump in the road but more like ran into a concrete wall.  I'm not sure there is coming back from this train wreck.  I mean through the magical power of guilt they turned Chewbacca (a species know to pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose at space chess) into a vegan and the Millennium Falcon into a flying chicken coop.  Meanwhile a pathetically depressing Luke spends his days drinking green milk that he pumps himself from a giddy female space walrus.  Intergalactic ships that run out of gas and fall out of formation as if they ran into air resistance in the vacuum of space.  WWII style bombers dropping bombs as if there is gravity.  Rey becoming a Jedi master and over taking Luke after two lessons.  Taking Kylo from a great villain in Force Awakens to a spoiled pouting impotent millennial brat.  His character really is night and day between the two movies.  Ugg really really bad!","true":true}
