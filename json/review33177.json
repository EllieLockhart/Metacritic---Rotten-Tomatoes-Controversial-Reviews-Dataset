Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a great movie. A compliment to what has come before\\, while moving beyond it. Rian Johnson is the first director of this generation that \\\"gets\\\" Star Wars so completely. Better than any fan theories or any of the Legends books. Can't wait to see it again!","true":true}
