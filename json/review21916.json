Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just saw it.. 5\/10  and that's bumped up by the graphics..  HORRIBLE story\\, Millions of missed opportunities. 90% of the movie is pointless. Great Graphics\\, Terrible forced Humor\\,  One  Dimensional Villains that simply become huge disappointments\\n Its a GIANT MEME that never builds up to anything of substance.","true":true}
