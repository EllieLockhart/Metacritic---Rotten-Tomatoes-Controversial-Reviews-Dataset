Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This could have been a great film\\, but it really ground to a halt in a few places.  So it would have benefited from a good script doctor and or a good edit. The humor of the film is somewhat out of place given the wholesale death that takes place in this film.  It's very dark to say to say the least.","true":true}
