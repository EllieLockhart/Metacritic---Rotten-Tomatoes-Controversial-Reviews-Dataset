Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect story\\,  but my opinion is its one of the best SW films. Great acting\\,  great directing\\,  fantastic sfx\\, not the best plots and that is ok everyone needs to settle down. I think Johnson made bold choices and decisions while staying true to star wars.","true":true}
