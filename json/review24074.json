Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mashup of \u201cEmpire Strikes Back\u201d\\, \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d in one. Also inserts of scenes from \u201cJurassic Park\u201d - vibrating drink\\, \u201cTron Legacy\u201d - light cycles on salt and \u201cTemple of Doom\u201d - Tunnel effects. Even dialogue and scenes were poorly mimicked with a very weak story (if any) this is the worst ever edition. Episode 7 was \u201cthe new hope\u201d rehash and this is the sequels. Looks like the ending is going to rehash the Anikin child story again from the prequels for episode 9! Finally looks like Ray is the incest child of Skywalker \/ Lelia which is pushing boundaries just too far in my opinion. This was such a massive disappointment. ","true":true}
