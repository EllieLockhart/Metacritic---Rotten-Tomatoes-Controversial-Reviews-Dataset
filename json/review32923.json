Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stimulating\\, inspiring and lots of character interactions combined with traditional battle scenes make this the best of all 8 Star Wars movies. My 9 year old son and most of the audience were yelling\/screaming with excitement on several parts. Loved it and apparently the critics do as well. Looks like the audience didn't so much\\, but hey what can you expect from a general public who eat up fake news and live off of the internet lies and gossip? Can you really trust their judgement? Not in this case.","true":true}
