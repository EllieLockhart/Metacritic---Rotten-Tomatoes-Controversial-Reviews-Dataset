Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without getting into too many spoilers\\, I did not enjoy 75% of this movie's content. I'm a big Star Wars fan\\, and there are some neat ideas in The Last Jedi on top of being a gorgeous film\\, but there are a number of things you typically see in very bad movies that I feel people are overlooking because it's Star Wars. From endless ex-machina moments to plots and subplots that go nowhere\\, I've never found myself cringing as much or being as bored with a Star Wars film since the prequels.","true":true}
