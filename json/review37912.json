{"101487":178933,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These are previous compiled rants to friends\\, nephews and just myself to vent and let go of this anger (Jedi training) Here goes...\\n\\\"Oh my heart is broken\\, so bad\\, why wasn't there a story worked out for all 3 episodes? The build up of characters and story should have been planned out and not left for some fan boy to make up his own on the fly and destroy what was there before from the previous director JJ Abrams. Characters like Snoke\\, and storylines like Kylo and Rey (who should be the Solo twins)\\, badly written cheesy jokes throughout\\, bad characters introduced\\, urgh. I knew i was in trouble from the first line by General Hux (he also is a horrible character btw\\, worse than Jar Jar for me) All I ask for is for someone to do a remake or JJ in Episode IX to start it off as \\\"It was all a nightmare\\\" Finn waking up from his injuries and realizing it was all a bad dream\\, explaining that episode viii was just a nightmare and for JJ to pick up were he left off on the force awakens. \\n\\nThis movie messed up the most with Leia\\, I'm happy that she is alive but Carrie Fisher died and unless you have footage that will be used in Episode IX\\, as originally intended before she died\\, then she should have just died in space (but to reinforce my Solo twins theory\\, going off of the novels written after Return of the Jedi\\, first explain that she had a twin (Rey) to Kylo and she didn't know about her because she was either unconscious or that she was taken away from her upon birth or that they told her the baby died or something) How can you get rid of characters and story elements without explaining it first? Or come up with new Force powers that are unbelievable\\, I love Princess Leia but you're dead girl you can't float back into a ship after being sucked out in space. This is like Superman IV\\, all believability lost when Superman takes a human out into space. I do not want any Rian Johnson involvement ever again.\\n\\nThere were cool elements and beautiful shots but r.i.p. star wars storyline.\\n\\nThe films are now marred\\, first Rogue One happened\\, but i was fine with that one because it wasn't part of the skywalker trilogies but The Last Jedi definitely has quality issues...\\n\\nI gotta say I did not love it. You can tell its directed by a fan boy and it sucks cause of too many jokey situations and again Leia in space wtf? No explanation of who Snoke is or how he came into power or how could he turn Ben Solo to the dark side. That's another thing\\, if Han Solo was there and gave permission to train him and his mother is a princess\\, general\\, good person\\, what possible situations would make you angry or turn to the dark side? Was Han abusive\\, did he leave and not care about his son at all? Inconsistencies... \\n\\nI refuse to also believe Reys parents are just nobody. Kylo is her brother to me but If Reys parents ARE no one and there is no Skywalker or other known Jedi connection then it would be awesome actually if Rey was born of the force like Darth Vader was to his mother. I understand anyone can have the force but that's for another story or trilogy or as an addition but not to be connected to the Skywalker saga (at least for my and many fans\\, preference) If Rey is that\\, then it's manipulative to make you think there is some sort of connection\\, from the prior movies\\, when there isn't. \\n\\nTo me its bad writing or careless writing to get rid of a character that you're supposed to find out who they are or how they came to be. Snokes origins were never explained...Darth Sidius was explained\\, he is Senator Palpatine\\, Emperor Palpatine\\, multiple names etc... Snoke was set up in a way to say he is the supreme Sith and in the force awakens set up so that you would get a back story as to who he could be or how he came to be all powerful and even temp Kylo. When all the other trilogies and episodes are set in the same way\\, to go out and try to do it differently\\, it throws everything off and its not loyal to the series. Doku was explained too\\, Darth Tyranus\\, etc... character development come on! That's were all the disappointment comes in\\, you don't care about characters\\, chemistry\\, charm\\, etc... all the negative audience reviews on rotten tomatoes prove this\\, the lowest of the whole saga. \\n\\nGiven all that... it's not a horrible movie\\, i still had fun\\, it still was beautifully shot but its NOT a proper star wars chapter and it is disappointing. \\n\\nI wouldn't have had a problem if it had been a new beginning\\, new trilogy\\, but when its in the middle of something that has started and wasn't thought out in advance like the other trilogies were\\, there lies the problem. The Empire strikes back and Return of the Jedi did not shut down anything that was built up prior to them. Same with Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith\\, even though a lot of people would have loved for Jar Jar to be casually gotten rid of\\, lol. They all build from it and add and reveal things\\, not just like \\\"Luke throwing his lightsaber off the shoulder\\\" or \\\"parents\\, what parents?\\\" (this one still has hope of explanation though) The director and writer just shows his age and lack of skill. He may get better in the future but I'm totally disappointed. \\n Still I'm going again Saturday and will own it on Bluray eventually\\, until episode IX comes along and I will call it quits after that I can't take any more heartbreak","true":true}
