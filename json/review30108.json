Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly I didn't like this movie. Good explosions but this is not supposed to be Michael Bay film. IMAX 3D could not save The Last Jedi. Makes me appreciate the masterpieces George Lucas delivered. Disney can't buy all the franchises and just throw money at them. Art can't be rushed or whatever they did to this story. Hamill's warnings were warranted.","true":true}
