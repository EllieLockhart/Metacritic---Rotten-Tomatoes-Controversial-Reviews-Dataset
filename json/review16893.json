Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the words of Luke Skywalker \\\"What a piece of Junk!\\\" This had to be the biggest cringe-fest on 2017. Snoke can read minds\\, force lightning\\, move people around\\, yet can't see a rusty lightsaber rattling on his metal armrest right by his waist??!! Green milk from seagoblins\\, Princess Leia flying like one arm out like superman in a vacuum of space???!!! This is not good work!! Lucas we forgive you! Is it too late to bring back Jar Jar?","true":true}
