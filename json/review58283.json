Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely dreadful movie.  \\n\\nI will say The Force Awakens was a more insulting movie\\, seeing as it was nothing but a plagiarist's dream come true.  But Last Jedi manages to completely ruin everything previous movies have set up.  The biggest offense is what they do with the character of Luke Skywalker\\, and it's something that is not only unearned but leaves a bad taste in your mouth by the end.  \\n\\nThe irony of these movies being a \\\"passing of the torch\\\" with new characters is that they don't seem to know how to write these new characters.  Finn continues to be useless and continues to act in a spastic fashion\\, Rey is a nobody with wavering motivations and purpose\\, the character of Poe is only made for us to dislike him even more in this movie.  Kylo seems to be the only thing the director\/writers is interested in trying to do something with\\, but even that's inconsistent and the reasoning behind some actions are weak at best.\\n\\nThe movie sucks.  It's a poor send off to Carrie Fisher and shows that they had no plans for this franchise.  It's very much a \\\"throw it at the wall and see what sticks\\\" method of film making.  I would compare these new Star Wars movies to WB's DC comic movies with how much of a failure they've been at achieving anything good\\, let alone great.","true":true}
