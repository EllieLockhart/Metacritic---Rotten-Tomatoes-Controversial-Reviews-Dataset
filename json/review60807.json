TLOU and TLOU2 are definitively my favorite pieces of media. Naughty Dog are redefining a medium.\rThe story is BRUTAL and it often elicited emotions that made me genuinely uncomfortable\\, but the payoff was super cathartic. The gameplay felt great\\, it has everything good from the first one and a few added mechanics that made fights feel really fluid. Needless to say\\, the graphics were phenomenal. The amount of detail made me want to take my time and explore every bit of the levels. The puzzles were definitely light in comparison with TLOU\\, but the ones that stood out were surprisingly natural. Figuring out a solution kind of felt like it wasn't even a fabricated puzzle at all and I just happened to find a way to solve a problem naturally.\rIt's crazy how some people are putting this game on blast. Reading a bunch of negative reviews I get the impression that these people either didn't even play the game or are just salty about one certain plot point and refuse to enjoy a narrative that makes them feel complex emotions. I feel sorry for everyone that can't appreciate how absurdly good this game is\\, both as a spectacular sequel to a game that should have been impossible to follow\\, and just as an awesome game in its own right.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
