Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie on every level. The tone is badly off\\, with flippant jokes destroying dramatic tension. Characters make maddening\\, irrational decisions just to serve the plot. Luke is a totally different person from who he was in the original trilogy\\, ruining the joy of seeing him properly return to the series. Other than the throne room scene\\, the set pieces are poorly executed and nonsensical. This film almost killed my love of Star Wars.","true":true}
