Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"dont listen to the disney pr- the low low audience score is correct to a tee!!    as a life long fan\\, born into it\\, grew up with the toys that were played\\, mangled and destroyed\\, and not kept in the box\\, someone who appreciated where the prequels came from\\, this film is a disgrace to the history and the lore of star wars- most scenes have a commercial aspect to it\\, or an agenda..... abso- shocking!!!!!!    i went on the premiere day\\, and it is the first star wars film i have no interest in watching anytime soon.i rate the prequels above this.\\n\\nso do not give in to the disney cash cow\\, in fact i feel like boycotting anything disney from this moment on.  ruined a legacy- ruined a franchise -  \\n\\nawful awful awful","true":true}
