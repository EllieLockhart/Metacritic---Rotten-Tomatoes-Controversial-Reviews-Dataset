Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold\\, ambitious\\, and utterly mesmerizing ride through the Star Wars universe\\, the Last Jedi has the guts to NOT give fans what they've been asking for\\, which is exactly what the franchise needs. As an avid fan\\, and a writer\\, I have spent many years thinking about what I have wanted from Star Wars\\, and what I would do were I ever given the chance to take the helm. TLJ went about as far from my idealized version of Star Wars as possible\\, and yet I could not be more pleased about that. You can't experience the joy of discovery and surprise\\, if you receive what you were expecting.\\n\\nAfter the sugar-coated suppository that was The Force Awakens\\, Disney has finally taken the Star Wars saga in a bold new direction\\, where the struggle of good vs evil has been skewed more toward a realm of grey. Rather than the done-to-death formula of J.J. Abrams' entry in the series\\, Rian Johnson has delivered a complex and emotionally-saturated work of art\\, that makes the audience work to find the meaning behind each scene\\, rather than spoon-feeding it to them as though they are toddlers. Some of the greatest decisions Johnson has made are sure to infuriate rabid fans\\, but in time it will become clear that the direction he chose to take these characters and storylines was ultimately best for the series.\\n\\nWhile shy of a masterpiece\\, this film does an admirable job of trying to please the three target demographics (Children\\, adult fans who have grown up with Star Wars\\, and adult fans who have wanted Star Wars to grow up alongside them). This is accomplished largely by creating a subplot to appeal to each group\\, be it Finn's wacky\\, child-friendly adventure\\, the truly space operatic struggle of the Resistance\\, and the complex and ever-shifting relationship between Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke. While this does not always work\\, and at times the tone of the film feels truly all over the place\\, it is a worthy trade-off to see the franchise grow beyond its roots\\, and strive to be more than just a repeat of what has come before.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that this movie is greatly enhanced by multiple viewings. Not only does it help to strip away the viewer's preconceptions (which is the biggest hurdle TLJ must face)\\, it also allows one to pick up on the carefully-woven threads of story that were place so expertly and subtly\\, that they are almost impossible to see the first time around.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, The Last Jedi is a flawed\\, but ultimately rich and rewarding experience\\, for those that are willing to accept that the movie they created in their mind was never going to be the movie that ended up on the screen.","true":true}
