Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie ever\\, what a disappointment. Totally destroys the build up of both the original trilogy and the force awakens. Rian Johnson has killed off the greatest cinematic franchise info one fell\\, swoop. Its obvious that he decided to shape his story with political undertones and cheap twists. He probably thought he was being clever\\, but by making everything so 'different'\\, he's essentially stabbed the franchise in the back\\, what a looser. Rian\\, when the dust settles and the defenders look back after a second viewing (If they could stand it\\, I know  I couldn't!) this will be seen as the weakest and most confusing star wars instalment ever. By the way Rian\\, by being so unnecessarily and artificially feminist\\, you've actually set back the cause here you douche bag! Show strong female characters for there own merit\\, not by making them put down stupid and incompetent make characters. Watch Stranger Things\\, Rogue One or Aliens to see how that happens you tool! Also\\, you don't need to destroy past characters to promote the new ones\\, here's a better idea: Take the best of the old and the new and let them work side by side. What an idiot! Either Rian has never seen star wars\\, deliberately wants to kill it off\\, is totally incompetent\\, or he's a pathetic 'yes man' to the feminist elements at Lucasfilm\\, i.e. Kathleen Kennedy. What a let down\\, hang your head in shame Rian and prepare to be booed and ridiculed for the rest of your life.","true":true}
