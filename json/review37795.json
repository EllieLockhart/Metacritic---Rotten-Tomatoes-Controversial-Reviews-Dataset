Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were definitely some slow spots in the movie\\, but I think the controversial ending made up for it. I was pretty satisfied with Luke as well\\, but I understand why some people were not. I think the decision was made to have him act grumpy was because that (just like Yoda and Obi-Wan) Luke had someone turn on him. In the original movies\\, Luke had to convince them that they needed to keep trying and giving up is not the right option. I think that it was an attempt to make the story go full circle by having Rey trying to convince Luke. Frankly\\, I am fine with this. Their was also a unexpected death in this movie. A lot people say it's was un-for-filling\\, but I've always believed that this is how Star Wars is. If you do like the idea of there being something unexpectedly shocking that greatly changes the outcome of the movie\\, then Star Wars isn't for you. This franchise has been around since 1977. I would think that we would all be prepared for it now. Overall I liked the movie and can not wait to see the next one.","true":true}
