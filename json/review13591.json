Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like because of the hype associated with this film the director went out of his way to subvert the expectations of the audience at the expense of good story telling and being true to the personalities of the characters. It made me feel like i was being trolled. Not a bad movie\\, but definitely out of place with the rest of the series and not worthy of the Critics score that it received.","true":true}
