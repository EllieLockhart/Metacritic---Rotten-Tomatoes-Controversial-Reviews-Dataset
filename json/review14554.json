Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have always questioned why Marvel movies get such stellar reviews for mediocre movies.  This steaming pile has just proven to me that Disney shells out major payola for reviews.\\n\\nThis is by far the worst Star Wars movie thus far\\, and I appalled the prequels.  There is a special in hell for Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for what they have done.\\n\\nPlease God let Samsung's Unspoil Me work so I can forget ever having seen this blight against humanity!","true":true}
