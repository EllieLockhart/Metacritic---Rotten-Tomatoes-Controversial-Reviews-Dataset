Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the producer tried too hard to include everybody from the past and as a result the movie is spread out all over the place. The Leia Witch from the Wizard of Oz scene was the worst.","true":true}
