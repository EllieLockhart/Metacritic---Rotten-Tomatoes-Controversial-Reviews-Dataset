Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Spoilers)\\nI am actually angry at this movie. It should just be called Star Wars: Deus ex machina! BB-8 seems to be able to do absolutely anything short of weilding a lightsaber on his own\\, while also being seemingly indestructible. Almost anything is resolved by some previously unrevealed ability of a character (e.g. Lea\\, or BB-8 every other minute).\\nWhere there is no surprising new ability\\, issues are resolved by ruining previous build up. Three examples: Poes mutiny being utterly pointless and of no consequence\\, Snokes mysterious origins and abilities made pointless and of no consequence\\, the great cannon at the end being not only not blown up\\, but also irrelevant as the solution is completely elsewhere.\\nThere is little to no character development\\, really only a little bit in Luke.\\nHalf the scenes could be cut without making the slightest difference in the plot. The lightsaber fights are the most boring I have ever scene\\, as is the \\\"chase\\\" between the rebel fleet and the first order fleet.","true":true}
