Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have loved Star Wars for years.  I really like TFA and loved Rogue One and wanted to love this one so much.  I completely hated this movie.  This is just a bad movie.  First mistake was having three different directors and writers.  Movie doesn't follow anything that was set up in the first movie\\, not coherent story telling at all.  Even as a stand alone movie it would be bad.  The main plot of a chase is space because the rebels ran out of gas is ridiculous.  The timeline is a mess and it in so many ways\\, for those trying to say it is new and fresh\\, is just a rehash of portions of the original three movies\\, except done poorly.  This movie is a prime example of just trying to be different or edgy for the sake of being different and edgy. The \\\"surprises\\\" were lame at best and hurt the overall story. This movie actually makes the TFA look worse. There was no purpose to this movie but to kill off luke is the worst way possible.  JJ has his work cut out for him.  To be honest\\, If they were to announce they were not going to make the next one\\, I would be happy.  Tme to leave this universe. I will most certainly never see another movie that has Rian Johnson's name anywhere near it.  He is a completely thoughtless train wreck of a writer and director.","true":true}
