Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi answers all mysteries brought by The Force Awakens in the most boring\/anti-climatic way that leaves us with no expectation for the next episode.\\nScenes that would be epic are ruined by jokes that throws the audience out of the movie and prevents us from caring for the characters.\\nThe whole movie is about one slow never-ending battle that will put you to sleep.\\nGood luck to J.J. Abrams to save the franchise from this terrible movie.","true":true}
