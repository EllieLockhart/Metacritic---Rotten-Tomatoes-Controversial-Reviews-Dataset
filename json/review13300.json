Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I do understand where the hate for this movie is coming from.\\nBut let's just remember that Yoda was a mess when Luke met him. And that Yoda did mistakes as well.\\nIMHO\\, this is the best StarWars movie in the series.","true":true}
