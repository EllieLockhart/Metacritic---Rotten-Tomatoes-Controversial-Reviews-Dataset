Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better then the Force Awakens. The Last jedi has a more unique storyline and fairly original action scenes. The story also has some intresting twists.","true":true}
