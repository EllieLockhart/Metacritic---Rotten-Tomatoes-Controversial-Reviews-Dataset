Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Invalidates everything that happened in the original Star Wars films. Luke\\, the hero of the galaxy? He's a cynical loser now who drinks sloth milk straight from the nipple. Apologists will claim that this is \\\"clever\\\" and \\\"original\\\" because it subverts expectations. That is not a valid defense. George Lucas made 6 films that told a monomyth\\, that illustrated the classical heroes journey for a modern audience\\, Disney clearly has no respect for the classics.\\n\\nTruly saddening to see such an offensive film be put in theaters around the world. This is going to break a lot of children's hearts.","true":true}
