It's full of brawling\\, honor\\, respect\\, patriarchies\\, gentlemanliness\\, and just an all-around good portrayal of male natural instincts.

It's full of brawling\\, honor\\, respect\\, patriarchies\\, gentlemanliness\\, and just an all-around good portrayal of male natural instincts. Women have their place in the game too\\, but they don't directly compete with the very brutal (and realistically portrayed) nature of men.\r\rBesides that\\, it's a pretty darn good game too. I'll get into the gameplay aspects first.\r\rThere's a lot to do in the game. I previously played Yakuza Kiwami and this game has roughly twice as much stuff to do. I spent 90 hours in this one compared to about 45 in Kiwami. There's more than 20 minigames\\, although most of them are gambling-based. The top two minigames are real estate management and cabaret club management. Both very different\\, but fun\\, addictive\\, and time-consuming in their own ways. And if you're a typical man like me\\, you'll also spend a lot of time doing the phone club mini game\\, where you talk to random girls on the phone until you convince one to go on a date with you\\, sometimes with unexpected outcomes. And then there's the gravure video collecting and phone card collecting (both featuring partially nude girls).\r\rLike Kiwami\\, the side quests are all interesting. They range from relatively normal to off-the-wall bonkers. A big part of why they're so appealing is that you're a masculine Yakuza (mafia) type\\, yet you partake in activities that are more appropriate for children\\, nerds\\, or anyone besides a Yakuza-type. This is the selling point of the game for me. This clash of expectations and the character's in-game reactions to you taking part in these is hilarious.\r\rThe main story is what sets the tone or seriousness of your character\\, to contrast the side quests and minigames. There's no comedy here. It's all serious\\, all of the time\\, and that's a good thing. Without going into detail on the plot\\, the story is good\\, good enough to be a TV or movie crime drama\\, which is better than what most video games do these days. It has a number of minor plot holes and video-game conveniences\\, but will satisfy most as long as you're not expecting a literary masterpiece.\r\rThe biggest plot hole is your protagonists' fists. You'll frequently be put into the position where the big bad guy will leave and send his 50 goons after you. But miraculously\\, you will be able to fight them all off. You do this so many times\\, that you might start to wonder if the big bad guys are taking you seriously and if you're actually Superman. Though this is common in many video games\\, so it probably won't bother most.\r\rAs a side note\\, the game supposedly takes place in the 1980's\\, but many of the advertisements in-game don't indicate this. Most are seemingly identical as in Kiwami (which takes place in a different decade). It's just a little disappointing to see 2000's style glamour advertisements in a game that's supposed to take place two decades prior.\r\rAnd finally\\, the game supposedly shows us how Majima Goro became the crazy person he is\\, but it doesn't do that very well. For most of the game\\, he acts basically like the other protagonist\\, and then all of a sudden at the end\\, he turns crazy. It would have been better if they just left out the crazy bit so fans could continue to guess how he went crazy\\, but there you go: we got the reason\\, even if it isn't a very good one.\r\rThis is a good one and I'm looking forward to playing the remakes of the other games in the series.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
