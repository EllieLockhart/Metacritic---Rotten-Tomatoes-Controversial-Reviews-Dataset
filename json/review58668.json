The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"At the end of The Last of Us Part II\\, there are several scenes which end on a cut to black which holds for a few seconds before the next scene begins. During many of the holds\\, I thought that was it: the game was done and that was the end. And though some were more happier and some were devastating\\, each of them would have been a powerful ending. The way that each new scene could rephrase or restate everything going before it was astounding. Any of these endings would have worked but still each new one deepened my appreciation for the game.\r\rThe only reason any of that works\\, then is because the game first weaves an intensely intricate story\\, spending hours establishing the setting\\, introducing and developing characters\\, and presenting themes and motifs that are echoed in these \\\"endings\\\".\r\rOf course this game doesn't do that on its own\\, it obviously leans on its predecessor. This is the best kind of sequel\\, one that deepens your appreciation of the original not by retreading the same points\\, instead it deepening the emotional core of the first game. I think \\\"Part 2\\\" is an appropriate name. This isn't telling the next \\\"The Last of Us\\\" story. This is telling the second half of the same story.\r\rI don't think I need to say that the presentation (graphics\\, audio\\, VO\/MC performances) of the game is amazing. The gameplay was enjoyable\\, making only a few quality of life improvements from the formula of the first game. I played on a harder-than-I-normally-would difficulty\\, which forced me to be much more tactical\\, taking time to scour for supplies and choose carefully when to use them. Playing this way helped the gameplay build into the dire\\, fight and claw for your life mood of the setting.\r\rI sympathize with anyone who wanted this to be a different game. I've been there before and it's not fun. But by taking the game on its own terms\\, what I got from this game was an immensely impactful emotional experience. While not everyone will love the story even on its terms\\, I don't think it's fair to compare the game against what you hoped. Because what it we do have is something pretty amazing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
