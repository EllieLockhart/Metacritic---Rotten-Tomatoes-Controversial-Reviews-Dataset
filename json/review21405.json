Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I had stayed home and read a how-to manual on watching paint dry. The plot was all over the place and came down to being completely pointless. Characters existed only to die quickly without any gravity or reason. This film makes me ashamed to be a star wars fan.","true":true}
