Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\, painfully long and boring\\, and incomprehensible after the first half hour. The film was an over-edited\\, unmemorable \\, cliche. Yes I am a Star Wars fan\\, and I would love even a halfway decent film\\, but this.. It's simply trash. I viewed the film in 2D imax for almost $20\\, but I refuse to buy into this commercial junk anymore.","true":true}
