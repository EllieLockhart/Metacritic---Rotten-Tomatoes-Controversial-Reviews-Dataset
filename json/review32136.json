Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"spoilers.... what a disappointment... say what you will about episode I\\, II and III... they had their issues (jar jar\\, need I say more). But the end of episode I had an awesome lightsaber duel between obi wan\\, qui gon and maul\\, II had yoda and dooku\\, III had an amazing lightsaber duel between obi wan and anakin. if you\\, like me\\, were hoping for something half as thrilling as any of those scenes\\, look elsewhere. Instead\\, you get Rey\\, who until recently had never held a lightsaber\\, be the equal of kylo ren\\, who has been trained by luke and snoke (more on that later). snoke suffers the dumbest of all deaths without even putting up a fight\\, but at least his guards did (hey\\, somebody had to). then there is all the other unanswered questions. ex\\, after all the build up of who Rey's origins\\, this movie just dismisses it like a little sidenote\\, same with Snoke. In fact\\, that was the impression I gad throughout the movie\\, it's like to Disney this whole exercise is a sidenote that they knew would make money riding the coat tails of the previous trilogies. it's like someone said\\, hey it's Star Wars right. people will just blindly see it right. Episode VII lacked the lightsaber action also\\, and Rey beat Kylo without ever holding a lightsaber\\, but at least it had a decent plot\\, which this movie lacks altogether. this movie is a huge disappointment!","true":true}
