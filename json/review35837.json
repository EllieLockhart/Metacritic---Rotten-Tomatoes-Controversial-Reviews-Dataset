{"101487":175454,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is polarising fans\\, yet critics love it. The reason is because director Rian Johnson (who flimed possibly the greatest hour of television ever - the \\\"Ozymandias\\\" episode of Breaking Bad) has made a film which purposely subverts expectations. This is a film where grand missions fail\\, and characters behave unexpectedly - in other words\\, like real life. It is beautifully shot\\, and ambitious in scope. Yes\\, a few jokes fall flat\\, and there is a rather cartoonish trip to a casino planet that could have been left on the cutting floor\\, but overall The Last Jedi has set the bar incredibly high for Episode IX. My only hope is that the producers don't get discouraged by negative initial reactions from \\\"true fans\\\" (in other words\\, people who can't accept something new and bold) and run scared back to copying the original trilogy.","true":true}
