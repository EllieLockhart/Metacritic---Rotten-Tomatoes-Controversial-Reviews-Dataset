Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, just wow! Why would Rian Johnson do this to a Star Wars film. I'm sorely disappointed with this film\\, especially its handling of Luke Skywalker. Is that really how Johnson sees Skywalker after Return of the Jedi?!? That aside\\, the plot holes and poor writing were enough to keep me wondering why this particular SW film was even made. This is the first SW film I've ever sat through and kept wondering\\, \\\"what's going on? Why?\\\" So many plot holes and questions left unanswered. Why would the writers\/producers just flippantly throw away Snoke?!? There was so much potential for this film and it just left me upset. The movie was great as far as some of thy fight scenes and action\/space scenes. And I can somewhat live with the fact that the Star Wars saga fails to recognize that space is a vacuum\\, until Leia gets sucked into it and does not die instantly. While I understand that the writers wanted Leia to \\\"awaken\\\" with her force powers\\, but really?!? After being suck into space?!? Come on! There are just too many problems with this film to cover in such a short review. However\\, I thought the last fight scene on Crait\\, when the soldier reaches out and touches the surface then tastes it and says\\, \\\"salt\\,\\\" is apropos for the audience. WE are certainly meant to take this movie with a massive amount of salt!","true":true}
