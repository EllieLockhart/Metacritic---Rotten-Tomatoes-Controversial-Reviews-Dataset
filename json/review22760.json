Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"literally the currently worst star wars movie made. just bad. the plots of the original trilogy are all crammed into one movie. princess leia is made useless. the rebel leadership is incompetent and the only reason the rebels survive is because the imperial (first order) leadership is written as even more incompetent. the blatant plot armor that protects rae and other characters is insulting.  the evisceration of luke's morality and complete disregard for luke's development in the original trilogy just destroyed one of the most beloved characters of all time. this movie shit on my childhood. rian johnson and disney have destroyed the franchise built over decades. DECADES. THERE IS NO HONOR IN THIS FILM. the franchise now feels like george lucas sold his soul and walked away from his own art without caring about a fanbase built over DECADES. sad.","true":true}
