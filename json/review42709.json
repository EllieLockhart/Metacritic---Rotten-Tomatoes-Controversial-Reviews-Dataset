Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was garbage. It has no Star Wars feel to it. It honestly feels like a Disney churned film with ridiculous product placement of unnecessary fuzzy animals. They destroyed Luke's character and spat out answers which was extremely anti-climactic.","true":true}
