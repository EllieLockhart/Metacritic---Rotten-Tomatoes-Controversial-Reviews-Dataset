The Idea of showing 2 Sides of the Medal and showing that both have blood on their hands is great too but it has too many Plot armor moments to make sure the hole hate theme has to end with both protagonists fighting each other in a final battle. The hole game tries to hit your emotion button...if it hits great but for a huge amount of us it doesnt....bad. This hole emotion\/Moral thing doesn't work for me at all even from the beginning. There is no reason for me to belief that Elli would have survived the killing scene of Joel. This hole Game remainders me of The Movie American History X but in bad. And last: We might disagree with out opinions but there are no reasons in this world to get so aggressive to sent people death wishes.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
