Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"FA \\, not too bad\\, curious to see where it goes. RO\\, a welcome surprise and obvious has love for the franchise as a whole. TLJ.......a disgrace.. absolutely blah. The first sw film that I didn't see multiple times and is the reason why I skipped solo and will be boycotting the new film and TV series. TLJ left me uninterested where the story is going and has almost completely turned me to the dark side. I hope Disney does the right thing and gets Rian fired Kathleen replaced and gives it to someone who won't run a beautiful saga such as SW into a garbage compactor. Also\\, it's never nice to have PR where u mock the fan base...scum","true":true}
