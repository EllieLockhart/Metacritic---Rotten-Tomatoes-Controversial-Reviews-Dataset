Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has definitely won the title of \\\"favourite star wars film\\\" for me. The bold choices made by Rian take you on a journey which leaves you gasping and on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is absolutely beautifully done. I love that the story shows you don't have to be someone to be able to make a difference. You just need courage\\, compassion and hope. Maybe Leia was wrong when she said to obi wan that he was their only hope. Hope lives in everyone\\, who dares to stand up to injustice. We are the spark that will ignite the fire that will burn the first order down. It only takes a spark\\, and we can all be that spark. \\nKelly Marie Trans portrayal of Rose Tico shows us this beautifully\\, and by saving what we love we can build a better universe. \\nThis film gives me goosebumps everytime. Fueled by a fantastic score and camera work which just shines like only a Johnson film could\\, it's damn near perfect. \\nThe critics are right. It's a gorgeous film to immerse yourself in.","true":true}
