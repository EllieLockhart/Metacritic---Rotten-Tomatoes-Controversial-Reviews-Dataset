Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An exciting\\, full of surprises movie\\, with both funny and emotional scenes handled better than the prequel\\, but falls short in terms of the character and plot handling and its follow-up\\, wasting some potential it has as a trilogy.","true":true}
