Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film looks great from a technical perspective and there is some solid chemistry between the actors. Daisy Ridley has the potential to capture hearts like characters of the original trilogy. I'm quite fond of her in the role and I personally felt Adam Drivers performance in this episode was standout. I feel like the films are falling short in other aspects. It doesn't seem to have as much heart as past films. I honestly think this movie was about 45 minutes too long and the story seemed dragged out. Through the delve into the lore of the Jedi religion; I feel like there were missed opportunities. However\\, the galaxy felt like it was expanded through the path they chose. The attempt to incorporate social justice messaging was a little on the heavy side; but I can look past it.  All in all it had some pleasant surprises and moving forward there will be opportunities to capture the hearts as past episodes was able to do. As far as ranking\\, this falls around mid-pack for me. I'm interested in future films capitalizing more effectively on the Jedi lore and seeing where they can take it as our beloved characters of yesterday fade out of the spotlight.","true":true}
