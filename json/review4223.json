Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By FAR.....the worst movie in franchise history. Where do you even begin?? I do reviews from time to time when I'm highly impressed.....and when I'm horrified. This movie is horrific in nearly every aspect. The sloppiness in the writing is just dripping off the screen.....the laziest bunch of charactor development this side of Family Guy and where you'd expect charactor continuity.....there is NOTHING at all.  In the span of 2 films..... EVERYTHING that was Star Wars is nay more. It's heartbreaking to watch and infuriatung to sit through. Kathleen Kennedy pushed a socio-political experiment with a Star Wars label and Director Rian Johnson gives AT BEST a schizophrenic directorial debut(for Star Wars) that has left all who have seen this monstrosity scratching their heads and foaming at the mouth.","true":true}
