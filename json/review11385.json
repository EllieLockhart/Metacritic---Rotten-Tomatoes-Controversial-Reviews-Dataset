Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible film. I think it's worse than Crystal Skull\\, which is saying a lot. It has so many contrived plot points and plot holes that I'd be wasting time typing all of them. Not to mention it throws everything that made Star Wars into Star Wars right out the window for the sake of \\\"reinventing\\\" the SJW-fueled modern narrative. Youtuber \\\"MauLer\\\" can fill in with the several-hour-long breakdown of this piece of trash.","true":true}
