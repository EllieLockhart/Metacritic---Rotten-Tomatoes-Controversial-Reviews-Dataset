Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The bad: This movie has a lot of plot holes\\, and a lot of things are not explained. Most of story arcs are poorly written\\, but saved by actors performance: Daisy Ridley\\, Oscar Issac and Adam Driver. The space battles are good but the pursue premise...But the worst of all I think that the Luke Skywalker character is handled wrong. There are a lot of references for a Luke post Return of Jedi in books and comics but for this grumpy version of Luke is chosen..\\nThe good: As always Star wars is an expectacle. Good space battles\\, the jedi duel is good but the one in the force awakening is better\\, my daughter liked the porgs. I do not understand how this movie has a review over 90% and Justice League got a 40%\\, I think both movies are almost in the same level - a 60%. I am beginning to think there is some preference because this is a Disney movie...please prove me wrong in a next review.","true":true}
