Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On the one hand it made 2 plus hours seem one so must have enjoyed it somewhere - the interplay between Rey and Ren is good at it core - but the space battle scenes and disregard for laws of physics in space and cannon with the weapons and ships\\, not to mention all the Hollywood over the top bits really let this film down - could have been the second best starwars ever - but feel it just got too much Disney in it to take itself seriously enough","true":true}
