Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film Subverted My Expectations(TM) and took the series in a Bold New Direction(TM) that could even be described as Brave(TM) \\nRian Johnson wrote up subversive script for sure\\, but for the singular purpose of being subversive and in the service of nothing.  Fan Favourites are killed off without fanfare\\, in exchange for mediocre walking-talking plot devices that are given names.  Simple names this time\\, so that you'll remember them even though you don't care to.  When you're not being bored by what passes for a plot\\, you're rolling your eyes at the ham-fisted attempts at political commentary.  Yes\\, yes\\, rich people are bad because they're rich\\, and you can tell who the villains are because they throw tantrums in every scene they're in.  This is some Ground-Breaking(TM) stuff here\\, Disney(TM).  \\n\\nRian cut every plot thread laid out in The Force Awakens\\, and left us with a poor film with an ending that felt flat\\, making it painfully clear that this new trilogy has no overall vision to guide it.  I don't care to see what comes next\\, and I feel sorry for the poor bastard that has to pick up the pieces for IX.\\n\\nI wouldn't say don't see it\\, but I would advise against *paying* to see it.  Thank me later.","true":true}
