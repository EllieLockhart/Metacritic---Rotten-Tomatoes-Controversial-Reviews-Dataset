Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the opening scene and the final scene with Luke... That's it. I absolutely hated Admiral Evening gown and the entire plot line surrounding her. This movie was SJW trash centered around a shitty leader.","true":true}
