Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a die hard Star Wars fan\\, and I enjoyed this movie on first watch a heck of a lot more than The Force Awakens and Rogue One (I've grown to love them).  It's funny\\, it's dramatic\\, the story has some issues but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  And that hyperspace scene. Holy wow.  So rare that silence is so powerful!","true":true}
