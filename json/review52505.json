Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible mess of bad writing\\, charachters that don't matter\\, recycled plot lines and plot arcs that go no where. if you count this movie as a star wars movie then discredit everything Luke's charachter stood for in the originals. This was the worst star wars movie yet.","true":true}
