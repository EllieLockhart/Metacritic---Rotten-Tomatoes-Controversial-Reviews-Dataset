Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star wars film in my opinion. Neither Luke nor Leia acts like Luke or Leia. The Guy who saw a little of good in the baddest guy in The Galaxy\\, decided to kill his nephew because he saw a little darkness in him??","true":true}
