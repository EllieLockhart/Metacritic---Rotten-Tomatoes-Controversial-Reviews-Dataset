Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed everything they did with this movie. it was fantastic! Luke Skywalker was great! Rey was great\\, Kylo\/Ben was awesome (even though he was a little boy throwing a tantrum hah). I don't think this is all that we will see of Snoke... We have one more movie to see where this story takes us! ","true":true}
