{"101487":99291,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-27","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A divisive\\, sometimes impressive\\, ultimately deeply disappointing film. The following were my thoughts a few days prior first seeing The Last Jedi\\, and meditating on it a bit.\\n\\nFirstly\\, I liked that porgs weren't a huge deal that took center stage. Some were worried they would be the new Ewok\/Gungan annoying comic humor. They really weren't\\, they were nice and subdued\\, a background piece. They were\\, I can say\\, one of the very few things that The Last Jedi did right\\, in my view. \\n\\nBut there are\\, in my view and in the views of so many fans who are unjustly characterized as 'hateful trolls'\\, a 'vocal minority'\\, or 'die-hard fanboys unwilling to see change'\\, tons of issues with Rian Johnson's heavy-handed and over-used subversion. These ideas ultimately fells hort. And not because they are subversive by itself. Subversion done right can be brilliant\\, surprising\\, entertaining\\, bold. [See Avengers: Infinity War\\, *Spoilers for that film*\\, where Thanos flat-out 'wins'.] But because they are subverting for the sake of subverting. And quite literally\\, subverting some of the very moves and ideas that were already subverted in the very same film\\, essentially doing a 180 back to where we began\\, only with any good reasoning or internal\/lore logic to say for it.\\n\\nFirst\\, the subject of Skywalker. I am not so strongly bugged that Luke fell. I am bugged by how he was treated\\, with respect to the lore\\, the fanbase\\, The Force Awakens\\, the old\/new canon and EU [please note\\, this is NOT to say I had some unlikely and far-fetched hopes that the EU would be in any way preserved\\, those are not my criticisms]. During and after Return of the Jedi\\, Luke is supposed to be truly at his prime. His persona alluded to in the film(s) and extrapolated upon in the old EU is something of the ideal Jedi. Indeed\\, for some time\\, he was *the* last Jedi\\, and the best rendition of them we've seen yet [at the time\\, this was before the great deal of jedi lore came out following the prequels]. He was noble\\, caring\\, peaceful\\, wise\\, sagely\\, and yet also powerful\\, observant\\, and reserved. He is the Luke as pictured in the Battlefront II game's campaign story\\, and in all the old stories from 'Legends\/EU'. I still remember reading the Tales From Jabba's Palace book\\, which indeed showed him as this character\\, who cared for all living beings and genuinely believed in the good of all of them\\, sparing sympathy even for relatively wretched or villanous characters. This was the Luke -we- knew\\, and the Luke Mark Hamill knew and respected.\\n\\n He was THE quintessential monk-like Jedi.  There is no problem that I see that results from his temple failing. But without ever seeing Luke in his prime\\, after Return of the Jedi\\, when he was young\\, capable\\, optimistic\\, wise. These are tales the fanbase would adore to see. And with this film rushing to put an end to that Luke Skywalker\\, there is a great gap of in-universe canon\\, decades of his life\\, that simply disappeared\\, maybe to be explained in paltry supplemental material. The failing of his temple is a good twist\\, and I like the *idea* of the battered old\\, jaded Skywalker. My problem is\\, we never have\\, and now.. we never *will*\\, (as far as I can see)\\, see Luke in his prime. See the confident\\, powerful\\, wise Jedi master he was meant to be.  We never get basic background as to what his temple was like\\, what his other students were like\\, who in Gods' name the 'Knights of Ren' even were!  Say what you will about J.J.\\, but The Force Awakens opened the door and directly alluded to\\, whetting our appetites for\\, explanations the likes of which we not only never got\\, but now never will get from the cinematic universe. And that\\, for a series as big as this\\, is a damn shame\\, and an error of judgment. \\n\\nThe second bit about Luke.. I honestly felt that if he was going to pass into the force anyway.. Rian Johnson should have given him the noble sendoff he deserved. There are so many ways this could have been done better\\, with incredibly minor changes. If he was able to raise his X-wing from the water and actually arrived in person on Crait\\, this would have been perfect. If he would have stood there\\, and using sheer force will that decades of mastery as the last Jedi in the galaxy would have yielded him\\, would have blocked\/absorbed the bolts fired from the AT-M6 battle line\\, that would have been amazing. Moreso\\, letting Kylo strike him down at the end of the fight there\\, just like Ben Kenobi did\\, not only to teach Ben Solo a lesson but also to become one with the force to better assist the resistance or something\\, would have been a fitting tribute and a noble end to the sagely Luke Skywalker. I feel that would have been great.\\n\\n\\nI have heard several anecdotes from different people who saw early or release-day screenings\\, where the audience cheered to find that Luke was just a projection and was out of harms' way. Luke\\, which we would be foolish to not admit\\, has been a greater part of the community's favorite character\\, favorite Jedi\\, was not going to be bested by this young\\, foolish\\, dubiously motivated Kylo Ren.  And yet\\, just a few moments later\\, the audiences are reported to have gone dead silent when he disappeared\/died. The mood and atmosphere remained sullen throughout.  This is not an issue of blind fandom and internet trolls\\, there is a significantly large community out there of fans who have been fans for decades\\, whose expenditures have carried this great legacy to what it is today\\, who are gravely disappointed in how the last film was handled. \\n\\n\\nThere's the aspect of how\/why Luke even died. Now\\, sure\\, there was the briefest and most cursory of explanations in the movie\\, with Kylo if memory serves stating to Rey earlier\\, in regards to the distant projection\\, 'you can't do this\\, you aren't powerful enough\\, it would kill you'\\, etc.  So yes\\, we can see that Luke does have great mastery of the force to do this\\, I just felt that him dying of... 'force-overuse(?)' was a bit hoakey. Yoda poofed because he was physically very old and dying of natural causes. Obi-wan prepared himself to become one with the force\\, such that it was an instant disappearing when Vader struck him. Luke just had a massive..force-exertion? I can sort of understand where they were coming from with the concept\\, I just thought he deserved better. And for this character so very paramount to the legacy of Star Wars itself. Our first\\, our most beloved protagonist\\, hero\\, and icon\\, to be killed off by some phenomena that was only so very lightly touched upon in the very same film? It appears forced\\, calculated. In my own screening\\, the audience clapped and a few breathed a sigh of relief to realize that Luke was still alive\\, and not in any danger. Especially when he tells Ren\\, 'See ya later kid'. Cool\\, seemed we might see him again in the last film.  Then\\, soon as we see him again.. poof. Just like Yoda. I guess he wouldn't be seeing Kylo again\\, really. There has never been an allusion to 'force-heaven' either\\, certainly not for un-turned\\, 'lost'\\, dark-side types. It was an awkward\\, even unnecessary sendoff to many\\, who felt Luke still had so much to teach Rey\\, to teach the new 'Jedi(?)'\\, and many agree that a new schooling of Grey Jedi would have been a great turn. \\n\\nNext\\, issues with the humor.  First of all\\, I liked the humor\\, but I thought it was a bit too much at times. It was definitely broaching the territory of Marvel movies. Don't get me wrong\\, I love the marvel films\\, but their better onces are all the more serious ones. The better Star was film\\, (Empire Strikes back)\\, is the darkest of it. Rogue one was a (depressing) but excellent turn of the old themes because it was especially dark.  So\\, I thought Poe's conversation with Hux at the beginning was funny\\, but it makes Hux\\, and the Order at that\\, look too damn silly\\, the same way Lucas made the B1 Battle Droids so damn cutesy and incompetent so as to cease any suspension of disbelief that they'd be used for any military application. I kind of want to like Hux\\, because he\\, (with Phasma out of the picture)\\, is\/was the face and voice of the Order (with Snoke out of the picture too)\\, but from TFA to TLJ\\, he went to smug\\, yelling and vindictive Imperial to a comically inept goofy cartoon villain. \\n\\nSpeaking of Phasma\\, poor Gwendolyn Christie was terribly under-used. The 'hype' surrounding her character\\, which people were likening to Boba Fett\\, ended in two dismal defeats before her death. Not only was she wasted as an actress\\, a potential iconic villain as it seems she was intending to be\\, never got their moment to shine. They're defeated so soundly on both occasions that\\, like Hux\\, we simply get the view that they are grossly incompetent. What a bummer\\, that the community was hyped to see her from the get-go\\, she gets so little use in TFA\\, and then literally just gets written off in TLJ. One wasted opportunity among so many. \\n\\nSo\\, continuing with the issues of villains.  Ben Solo\\, Kylo Ren. *sigh*.  He was honestly my favorite villain character in the entire franchise under Vader himself. He has been portrayed as the most nuanced\\, self-aware\\, tortured and near-redeemable villain in the entire series. But he's been handled in a pointlessly wishy-washy way. He was confident in TFA\\, tortured by his choice\\, but then afterward impressed me and the rest of us by 'doing the deed' and 'killing the past'.  He was a menacing baddie at that point. Now\\, in this film\\, we *again* see him turning toward the light with his refusal to blast Organa.  This culminated in what I honestly thought was an awesome throne room scene where he refutes Snope's wishes (a 'surprise' scene so obvious I was certain they weren't going to go that rout) and sort of strike out on his own. I was so happily surprised when this happened\\, finally.. we get to see something of the 'Ben' that existed in the old canon. We see for a glimpse\\, Ben being Ben again. And yet\\, immediately afterward\\, what do they do? They have him turn around again. Alright\\, so they've decided he is wholly irredeemable. I don't hate this decision\\, but I honestly thought the decision was already made in the first film.  What's worse\\, Kylo's motivations are as vague as they ever have been. I thought it may have been wise to make his *whole* turn to the dark side out to have been orchestrated solely by the powerful\\, manipulative Snoke\\, who sought to take advantage of his part-Skywalker bloodline. After all\\, it -has- been alluded to be Leia et all that Snoke was the one behind his turning. When? Where? Why?  We were given no clear answer\\, and instead the plotline was written off. The dark side was strong in Kylo because the Force willed it? His master\\, Luke\\, failed him in this split-second decision (which most will agree was not a very Luke thing to do\\, kill a nephew based on some passing feeling)\\, but what reason did he have to flat-out destroy the temple and apparently found the 'Knights of Ren' (who still are a no-show..?). It's one thing to feel momentarily betrayed by Skywalker who apparently never even swung his saber at him\\, and if Snoke was influencing him as well\\, this makes sense.  And yet\\, after he finally tries to redeem himself and off Snoke\\, he does what?  He grasps for the power of the First Order?  You see\\, I loved Kylo because he was nuanced\\, haunted and tortured by himself and his split feelings that were tearing him apart. [which\\, again\\, would have been great if the the whole reason for this was Snoke's powerful manipulation.. his anguish being a literal result of him not being able to stop doing what he didn't ever want to.]  And by the time of the scene on Crait\\, he is reduced to a generic\\, screaming evil villain whose motivations are as generic as they could be. Power.  'Order'. Supremacy.  It might be the classic role of the dark side\\, but despite Rian's apparent attempt to get rid of dead-end and boring characters\\, which he saw Snoke as\\, he literally made one out of Kylo Ren\\, and dissolved the mystique of Snoke\\, which posed genuine questions far more important than 'so how did Solo get the Falcon?'\\, out of what appears to be a smug\\, arrogant and fallacious excuse that Snoke was just another Palpatine. As if that is sufficient reason to -ensure- he is just another palpatine by writing him off. Did it before so we should keep doing it?  An awful precedent.\\n\\nMy last topic on Villains\\, Snoke. The problem of bloodlines in the Star Wars franchise was created the moment Lucas decided to fumble in his absurd midichlorians concept. This made what was the optimistic\\, open-ended usage of the force\\, which anyone with a strong enough mind and intelligence could learn to use and master\\, into little more than a kind of space-disease.  This\\, I believe\\, is why\\, TFA\\, the fans\\, the director\\, and so on\\, were making such a big deal about who the hell Rey's parents were\\, who the hell Snoke was. It matters because lineage matters in Star Wars ever since midichlorians. The most powerful force-wielders would not have strayed far from established characters. It  also matters because that is literally how TFA was directed. It focuses and begs the question of Rey's parentage. It deliberately makes Snoke out to be a mysterious villain whom we know nothing about. A 'Sith'\\, or dark-side Force user who is literally more powerful than Sidious or Vader\\, or anyone else beforehand\\, maybe save for whomever the old Plageuis was. Since TFA fans have theorized and questioned and asked for who this guy was. Where he came from\\, what his motivations were\\, why he wanted Skywalker dead\\, what his connection to the First Order was\\, where he learned his powers\\, how long he lived\\, how he got his crushed donut-hole-looking face\\, and so on and so forth.  All of that set-up\\, to what I honestly felt was an interesting villain\\, was set up for nothing. Rian found him boring and merely decided to subvert our expectations and off him without explaining any of this.  So while his death was so telegraphed as to be more surprising that he -didn't- see it coming more than anything\\, doing so also left gaping\\, unexplained plot-holes. It also kills off any chance of a more menacing\\, more powerful villain. We are left with the bumbling\\, idiotic Hux\\, and Screaming-Evil Kylo\\, who is evil because reasons and backs the First Order because power or something?\\n\\nFor all his back and forth turning and turning again\\, Kylo honestly comes off as too weak\\, too lacking in control\\, discipline\\, and conviction to be a strong villain. As simplistic as Snoke may have come off to some\\, he played the role properly of the wise strategist villain behind the scenes\\, keeping the First Order together\\, just as Palpy did the Empire. The aged\\, intelligent\\, seer. Like Palpatine\\, but even more rational and incisive.   My last issue with him was how he flip-flopped. I rather enjoyed the scene where he's patronizing and essentially bad-mouthing Ben to his face. Talking about how he knew he would be weak and would feel the draw of the light\\, and I loved how he effortlessly flung Kylo when he sensed him moving against him.  But this contrasts night and day\\, to a degree that's hard to even believe\\, with a scene not long after in the film where he claims Ren impressed him as his skilled apprentice. It didn't seem believable\\, it was flip-floppy. Palpatine and Vader's back and forth seemed more sadistic\\, and yet Palpatine didn't seem quite so rational as devious and wrathful\\, and Vader was far more stoic and passive. To contrast\\, Snoke seemed far -more- intelligent and impartial and Kylo the opposite to Vader. Which makes it so much harder to believe. \\n\\nAnyway\\, my last complaint in the Snoke department\\, I was baffled at how blind he could be in the way he was killed. The man is so strong\\, so wise\\, so gifted in foresight\\, so aware of his surroundings\\, that he could toy with Rey and Ren at will. He caught her saber and bonked her on the head with it.  He claims he literally cannot be betrayed by Ren because he can see his every thought\\, and (probably\\, I had hoped) influences them all too. [again\\, him being literally at the helm of Ben's actions I thought would have been a great plot choice\\, and would explain his angst and anguish perfectly\\, since he's literally not himself].   But he can't see\\, hear\\, or sense\\, the lightsaber to his right side turning toward him?  Again\\, sure\\, I liked the scene from the sense of how it was directed. Subversive\\, cool. But Snoke almost goes out like an idiot\\, bragging about how Ren was going to kill 'his true enemy'\\, it was too obvious\\, and you'd expect Snoke to have far more foresight than this. So obvious in fact that I half-expect him to come back as a force entity or with a cybernetic lower body. You couldn't imagine this for Palpy. Palpatine was killed while he was actively engaged in zapping Luke at least and beside himself\\, cackling like a dick-wagon. Snoke was sitting there\\, in all his senses\\, observing the two of them.  Even the manner in which he died aside\\, once that initial 'wow' factor has worn off following his death scene\\, we can almost see that fourth-wall-breaking decision by the director to literally write him off without any further explanation. The same way Rey's parentage was written off\\, making her 'cave scene'\\, TFA's direction\\, and narration\\, all the fan's theories\\, a collossal waste of effort\\, energy\\, and care. Millions of fans across the world had invested so much thought and care\\, into something that one director\\, with complete and utter disregard for the fanbase in favor of his sloppy\\, twisting\\, turning\\, self-undoing 'vision' can write off as though it was the way to treat such a franchise.\\n\\nThat roughly sums up where I took issue.  The other two quips I had were canon ones. It actually bugged me because I could see at two small points in the film that my meager nerd self\\, was more practically concerned about what I was seeing making sense in the SW universe than all the heads of the film were. Two major points and one small one. During the rebel fleet's long\\, almost overly-drawn-out escape\\, Snoke's ship is shooting at it\\, and for some absurd reason\\, the blaster's green bolts are seen.. arcing.. downward as they travel\\, toward the rebel fleet.  What.  How.  In space?  There's no gravity in space. Furthermore\\, blaster bolts of all sorts do not arc; their state of matter is not effected by gravity.  Arcing would make no sense in space\\, and would limit their effective range ridiculously short in space of all places. You can tell I'm a SW nerd.  But seeing that just made me cringe and ask why\\, and how I could know better than the literal heads at the helm.  Secondly\\, it was a little odd that the rebel ships all had.. unlimited shielding. That does somewhat fly in the face of most canon\\, but I guess to their credit they mentioned that the range of the ships made it so that the blasts weren't as powerful as they should have been. However\\, it did amaze me that with all the forces The First Order has at their disposal\\, they could not dispatch or call upon one single ship in all of their fleet that was faster than the rebels to move in closer and harass them\\, cut them off\\, or stop them in their tracks.  \\n\\nExpanding on this idea\\, the 'bombers' in the beginning made no sense.  Having to fly over the dreadnaught and having to drop their bombs straight downward\\, assisted by...    gravity?  Again?  Seriously?  Did some creative\/visual designer completely forget that there is no two-dimensional gravity in space\\, before they came up with the scene with the arcing bolts and bomb dropping?  Is this the director?  Is it actually possible that someone in charge of such a powerful\\, iconic and insanely popular trillion dollar franchise would simply 'not realize' this?  I get it\\, I get what they're harkening back to visually\\, it's kind of obvious. The old WWII bomb-bay door-type scenarios.  It just makes virtually no sense for them to rely on 'gravity' (real or artificial)\\, in space\\, to drop bombs\\, and it's pointlessly limiting to have to do so by being 'above' your target anyway\\, even with some manner of intelligent downward propulsion (that isn't gravity) in space\\, since you're putting yourself in great unnecessary danger. On a planetary surface this is fine\\, and they would function conventionally\\, but even Y-wings and TIE-Bombers can eject their ordinance 'outward' toward the target while in space\\, and don't have to be right on top of it to do so. The series has plenty of missiles\\, torpedos\\, and whatnot in canon\\, so it would have made so much more sense for them to be decked out with tons of missiles.  Funny enough\\, if you play the old X-wing v. TIE Fighter type games\\, which were essentially simulators\\, bombers all use missile-type ordinance because it makes the most sense in space\\, and their biggest advantage is that they can fire them at greater 'stand-off' range than any fighter's blaster bolts would be able to reach them at.  So\\, they could fire-and-forget\\, then turn away. \\n\\nOne final tidbit.. almost everyone I know agrees that the silly Canto Bight scene included a bit of pointless flare\\, seeming far too akin to what we had to watch in the prequels\\, not to mention it halted the plot and lead us nowhere\\, with a ham-handed moral message that seemed strangely forced and squeezed in there when it didn't need to be. The only tiny glimmer of something interesting it offered\\, to me\\, was again a strike against the polarization of the rebel\/imperial dichotomy by showing eventually that some arms dealers sold both to First Order and The Resistance. Which was very pleasantly Rogue-One-ish. And it wasn't that that whole anti-corruption\\, anti-capitalist if you will (though you can argue why Star Wars is\/was\/should ever be about that)\\, message is wrong or shouldn't have been explored in the film. It was that nothing about the film called for it\\, and in fact\\, the circumstances demanded the opposite. Finn and Rose' friends were literally dying out there in space\\, being pursued and shot\\, (indefinitely? Odd how shielding lasts forever because the plot armor makes it so) to bits while they gallavanted around a sci-fi casino freeing the cute big horse things because oppression is bad. Despite that these creatures would likely be re-captured within a week or less.\\n\\n Also\\, kind of another plothole I don't understand. Why did Skywalker create a mysterious map leading to himself only so that the person that arrives could be summarily dismissed as he was content to live and die on that island? Honestly. It was a more decisive film than TFA\\, and in many ways enjoyable. And yes.. it did take chances and subvert expectations. But it's also clear to so many that the direction didn't give a shit about answering any questions or respecting the fanbase's current thinking whatsoever\\, and just started writing off\/killing everything that left open ends. It's almost ironic\\, Kylo's line\\, 'Let the past die\\, kill it if you have to'\\, seems the mantra of the heads of the series. The fact that they had to go and carry on the story from the old films meant they felt pressured to re-introduce the old characters. And now\\, likely because Disney wants to keep star wars going for the next several thousand years\\, they feel they needed to murder off Han\\, Luke\\, (and likely in the next film Leia)\\, off. Rian even decided to murder off several open-ended plots\\, leaving gaping holes behind. Honestly\\, they didn't need to kill off any of them. Letting them simply fade into irrelevance in the background would have been sufficient. Han's had meaning at least\\, since it related directly to Ben\\, and he was really just the same old smuggler in the end. Luke's\\, I didn't hate the idea of\\, but I just felt he had so much more to offer before it happened\\, and it was not done very well at all. And who knows what they'll do as Leia. As for the plotholes\\, if going forward\\, the standard we set is setting up huge questions\\, murdering them off in a blatantly careless way\\, than explaining it (maybe) through supplemental material\\, that is just an awful precedent to set.   \\n\\nIn short\\, Rian over-did his subversion\\, seemingly doing it for it's own sake; doing it so blatantly as to break the fourth wall for me and many other viewers. And it is incredibly frustrating to see because the film makes all the right turns that this series needed\\, all the fresh new unexpected twists that would have been great.  Then\\, in a move of remarkable\\, insultingly banal switches\\, reverts or reverses -every- single one of them. \\n\\nThe writing\/plot took too many turns. First\\, the 'Jedi having to end' was a brilliant concept\\, a real paradigm shift that the series desperately needed to stay fresh. That's ACTUALLY NEW for star wars! Wow. Then by the end of it\\, 'there will be more jedi'\\, and we see the scene of little force sensitive rebel children. Rey has the books\\, Kylo is a generic baddie\\, and for all intents and purposes we can assume the same back and forth will go on eternally. So thematically\\, how odd is it that you'd tease a switcharoo of the formula in the trailers by rebuking light and dark\\, which would have been a fantastic segue into Grey Jedi\\, then just did a switcharoo back in the end?\\n\\nJust like Kylo was complex and conflicted\\, did a switcharoo to a potential awesome and actually great subversion where he teamed up with Rey and could have been a good ben solo.. then also switcharoo'd back by the end for 'reasons'? This is a serious issue with him now. All of his layers and texture is gone. By the end of it he's another rage-filled impotent would-be Darth. The logic of it just doesn't fit\\, if he was just previously willing to rule the galaxy peacefully with Rey. The caveat of which\\, for no apparent reason\\, was that he just wanted her to sit by and let her friends be killed too. Why?  Don't get me started.\\n\\nNot to mention the thematic 180's or plot focuses that came out of left field at inappropriate times.\\n\\nRose criticizes Finn for trying to sacrifice himself\\, while her move itself could very well have been self-sacrificial. Holdo literally sacrifices herself in the same film\\, and Luke does as well. \\n\\nIf a life of slavery is so terrible\\, why were the children not freed from Canto Bight\\, and instead the animals were\\, which could be easily corralled in very little time.\\n\\nLuke's 'The Jedi must die'\\, contrasting night and day with his 're-assuring' 'And I won't be the last Jedi'.\\n\\nThe attempt to burn the sacred Jedi texts. Yoda does this for him\\, Luke seems to regret the decision\\, Rey actually saves the texts\\, effectively guaranteeing no change whatsoever in the Jedi order. Leaving the message the film was trying to sell us about the Jedi needing to die\\, from as early as the trailers\\, to be redundant. \\n\\nThe irony is that for all the subversion\\, Star Wars has ended up exactly where it began. An 'Empire' in power\\, a fleeing resistance\\, promise of new Jedi\\, and big bad force-wielding evil guy.  Except it's the worse for wear\\, because this isn't the start of a new and untold franchise\\, and we're all too well-aware of the bizarre decisions which lead to this point. Whatever comes of the last entry in this trilogy\\, looking back on it\\, you will never be able to shrug off just how clearly self-destructive the turn is from TFA to TLJ.  The reversal act has forever been cemented into the series going forward\\, weakening it's overall structural integrity as well as sacrificing decent and coherent story-telling as one director moves so very strongly against the previous ones' decisions. The questions unanswered\\, that were set up in TFA will always plague this series. You will never be ablt to watch TLJ retrospectively and not see the director's hands writing off one element or the other in such a sharp turn.  Something about all this reeks of intentional sabotage\\, 'orders from above' to execute all ties to the original trilogy\\, or\\, the very worst possibility\\, a sub-par director on an intensive ego-trip which put him\\, in no small way\\, at odds not only with a great number of the fanbase\\, but of Mark Hamill himself.  In a sad and sobering sense\\, Mark's well-documented bitterness and disappointment is a very clear perspective of nearly half of the community abroad.  Mark Hamill was an actor committed to a role in a franchise like this the likes of which I don't think we'll see again in Star Wars. He is a fan\\, or was a fan\\, of the character. He wasn't just phoning in a part\\, the role of Luke Skywalker meant something to this man. He had his beliefs\\, and gave Luke a voice of his own\\, direction of his own. Very early on; he was even critical of George's decision to have him kill the wompa in the ice cave because he reasoned that this creature was not 'evil'\\, but simply hungry.  Mark 'believed' in Luke\\, just like all of us did.  And as one fan to the other\\, he too was disappointed by the way he was treated. Some part of me even has a sneaking suspicion that possibly\\, maybe\\, Mark didn't even know that Luke would die the way he did\\, and that this was done in post-processing. \\n\\nIn any case\\, Mark Hamill\\, you were right about the mis-characterization. And about understanding and respecting the audience. He didn't say these things to be meek and to influence Rian into being a passive yes-man to what the masses want. He did so because he recognized just how strongly Rian's sacred cow 'vision' conflicted with the lore\\, with fans' expectations\\, and even TFA itself. There are problems afoot about all of this. On one hand\\, you have a strange company of social justice virtue signallers\\, who -insist- that anyone who doesn't like the film is a racist\\, misogynistic white male. (Ghostbusters PTSD\\, anyone?) Even where it is entirely unwarranted. There are those that insist that people dislike it simply because it didn't pander completely to fans. And undoubtedly there are those who are critical of it without putting thought and setting up intelligent arguments to explain their perspectives\\, and certainly you do have a minority of internet trolls. \\n\\nIn any case\\, looking back at this film years from now\\, as I've said\\, the plot-destructive and thematically wild mess that was TLJ will forever be imbued in the series. The ham-handed\\, reckless crossing out and writing off of what was carefully and optimistically laid out in TFA will forever be present as a break-neck reversal\\, almost shamelessly\\, arrogantly so. This isn't helped by the impression folks have been given that the director was particularly arrogant or smug\\, a man who was sure his vision was what Star Wars needed\\, certain somehow that the grave mis-characterizations\\, bizarre bait and switches\\, and plot holes were good for the series. It doesn't help that he's gone on record to insult and demean fans\\, or to say\\, that he doesn't believe any of the fan criticism is valid. He has shown very little humility in the effort. And some forces that be are quick to shout down protest as 'a minority of misogynist trolls'\\, a frankly frighteningly fallacious statement\\, especially when painted as such from the collossal juggernaut that is Disney.  With Kathleen et all's rather infamously vaunted\\, even politically extremist remarks that have come to light ('The force is female'\\, way to be exclusive\\, or 'we are getting a lot more pragmatic and specific about not accepting the level we have regarding women in visual effects and technology.. at the moment\\, 75% of the people in visual effects are men and that's unacceptable.. our ratio at ILM is better than that\\, but it's still not enough' - Lynwen Brennan\\, on explicitly seeking out individuals not due to inherent talent but to fill a fixed sex quota based on their political views)\\, one wonders if there isn't some smug\\, entitled maneuver that came from top-down which insisted that threads be cut by whatever means necessary\\, which might then have forced Rian's hand into crafting what was ultimately a mess of a film\\, which did so much dismantling as to leave the series effectively in tatters.\\n\\n There's a fragile internal sense of logic and consistency that has been broken to the audience. It wasn't subtle enough; it was simply too much\\, too fast. It doubled up on itself and even contradicted itself while destroying\\, blatantly\\, obviously\\, all that was set up before it. Simply put\\, I don't just speak for myself here when I say that I am no longer looking forward to what the franchise has to offer. Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rey have had such miniscule development -together-. There is no 'crew'\\, no 'family'\\, and the trilogy is already nearing its' end. Rey's whole intrigue was largely the question of her family. It is undeniable that she has otherwise lived up to the title of Mary Sue. She simply isn't interesting; she lacks depth. She's all competence and impetuosity\\, fierce and unbridled toughness\\, and that does not make for an interesting character. Her thread to her past has been callously revoked. She continues to be a boring part of the film\\, exceeding at just about everything and being generally impetuous and undefeatable. Her motivations are vague besides the self-interest of who her parents were\\, which has consumed her character from the start. https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/7lo951\/does_rey_ever_fail\/  \\, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PE2at2Wo9sU \\n\\nTo contrast\\, Finn cares a lot about her\\, Finn clearly respects and appreciates The Resistance\\, and even aspires\/aspired to be a part of that\\, if he could overcome his fear of the Order. In this film he had a good character arc\\, even if Rose was forced into there to deliver some insultingly cheesy platitudes which scolded him for what was really a fantastic act of heroism on his part. I really cannot see why she was added in the film\\, as she merely complicates the new 'love triangle' between the Rey and them\\, and I fear was added just to fill a 'female+minority+bodypositive(?) representation quota'.\\n\\nPoe has been a flat-out\\, untouchable badass Gary Stu from his inception as well\\, even though I would say he's been a charming one\\, just as Rey is fun to watch when interacting with others.  In this film his characterization leaps far into an extreme of incompetence and recklessness. Many have found his conflict with Holdo to be pointless\\, unnecessary\\, a very long plot thread that ultimately doesn't pay off. Like most in the film\\, if not all of them. Where any consistency and sense of pacing or sane plotting is sacrificed for a 'gotcha' twist. At -least- he does mess up and face dire consequences\\, unlike Rey.\\n\\nAnd the three of them\\, together\\, have simply had no group chemistry or screen-time. In TFA\\, Poe and Finn had this nice\\, quick chemistry right off the bat which I really appreciated and enjoyed. But shortly after\\, just like that they're split apart. The legacy that has made Star Wars what it is\\, was brusquely murdered off. The pacing\\, coherence and structure of the films has been radically upset and broken by swapping from one director to another and back again. Or\\, I should say\\, swapping to someone who felt radical twists\\, bait-and-switches\\, and constant self-reversing 'gotchas' were the order of the day\\, as well as strange characterizations. I don't know what the future of the franchise at large holds\\, but I can say for certain that I have little interest in it going forward. And I can tell you with complete honesty that it has nothing to do with a reaction to what many find to be overbearing politicizing\\, female casts members\\, minorities\\, or anything so silly as that. (I'm a part of the LGBT community myself\\, and I don't happen to be 'white'.)  It's because of the complete and utter disrespect TLJ has shown for basic story continuity\\, consistent characterization\\, and respect to plot threads that were carefully woven open so that they could be continued in the next film.  This 'Ad-lib' nature of the series has\\, for better or worse\\, fallen on a troll of some sort\\, some antagonistic egoist\\, who has intentionally undone what the first person has written\\, as though to make it harder for him to even recognize it.  And the series is forever tainted with this. Short of time travel\\, or force-magic\\, there is little that can be done to salvage the incredible damage that has been done to story continuity\\, or the fans' broken over the treatment of who was probably the most beloved character of them all.","true":true}
