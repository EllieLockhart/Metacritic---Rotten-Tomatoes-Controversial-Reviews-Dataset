Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Didn't develop any of the characters again many of them seem to gain knowledge\/skills such as lightsaber duelling with no actual instruction on how to do so. \\n\\nThe Story changes the traits of characters especially characters such as Luke Skywalker who is suddenly the least hopeful most pessimistic person in the galaxy without any real backstory for it.\\n\\nThe main character is basically perfect in every way which is just ridiculous doesn't struggle with anything just miraculously can overcome anything.\\n\\nWatch the movie by all means there are some nostalgic moments in the movie and but it's just not consistent with everything that came before.","true":true}
