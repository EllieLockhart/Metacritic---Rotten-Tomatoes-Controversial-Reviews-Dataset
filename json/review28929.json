Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed with the sequel trilogy so far. It feels like they bring back the old characters to have at fans' nostalgia\\, then butcher them figuratively and literally. Meanwhile\\, the new characters are left alive and fine despite being nowhere near as compelling as the old characters. If you're a white guy\\, you''re dumbed down and out of character! The only thing these movies have done for me is give me a newfound appreciation for the all six of the original Lucas movies- even the prequels. Lucas should have NEVER sold to Disney!","true":true}
