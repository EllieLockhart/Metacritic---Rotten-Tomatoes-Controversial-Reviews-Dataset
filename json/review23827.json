Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made a account just so I can put a rating on here. Looking through audience reviews there is no way the audience score is so high. It should be much lower. \\n\\nVery disappointed with this film. Everything was thrown in the trash from everything built up to this point. I really liked FA and Rouge One. but this was no good.","true":true}
