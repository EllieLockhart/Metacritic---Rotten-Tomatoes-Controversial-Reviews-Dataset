Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow in the middle\\, too much comedy but overall this is a nice addition the the Star Wars Universe.  It will be exciting to see what he can do with an original story and full creative control across three movies.","true":true}
