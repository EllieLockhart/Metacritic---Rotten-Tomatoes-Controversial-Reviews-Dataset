Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was beautiful and unexpected but still so familiar. It was super exciting\\, funny\\, and deeply touching all at once. It kicked so much ass that I don't even know how to cope with it. In time I will recover. Thank you Star Wars for re-igniting the love of the force.","true":true}
