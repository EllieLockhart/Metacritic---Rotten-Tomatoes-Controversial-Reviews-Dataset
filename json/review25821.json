Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Note: I'm leaving a 5-Star even though\\, had I my druthers\\, I'd be more likely to give it a 4-4.5\\, because this movie does not deserve the low audience rating it is currently boasting. The Last Jedi delivered exactly what was promised from critic reviews I've read. It was true to the preexisting saga while finding its own legs. There were twists and turns abound\\, and I understand why some viewers may have disagreed with certain choices\\, but a film does not deserve a low score merely because one disagrees with choices made. Go see for yourself. It's well worth it\\, because if nothing else\\, it was a highly entertaining ride!","true":true}
