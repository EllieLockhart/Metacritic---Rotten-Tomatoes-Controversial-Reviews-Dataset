Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was looking forward to this movie.  Episode VII and Rogue One were pretty strong\\, and a welcome reprieve from the horrid I-III prequel series.  Instead\\, I walked out after 30 minutes.  It's THAT bad.\\n\\nSPOILER ALERT\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nI tried to give the story a chance to develop an exposition. What is the setting (besides \\\"space\\\")? Who are the main hero and villain? What are the motivations of their conflict?\\n\\nIn the first few minutes\\, we're introduced to a flurry of characters. Some seem like new bit characters\\, and some are characters from previous episodes\\, and it's clear who is on which side of the conflict. However\\, it's never established who the main hero will be between Dameron\\, Leia\\, Finn\\, or Ren\\, nor is the main villain established between Hux\\, Snoke\\, or Kylo. Several bit characters come and go within the first few minutes\\, having significant impact on the plot\\, but no development or attachment. In contrast\\, the original trilogy always made it crystal clear that Luke and Vader were the main hero\/villain\\, and bit characters just provided henchmen-like filler action\\, while the main characters moved the plot ahead.\\n\\nAt this point\\, we all know \\\"why\\\" the conflict exists between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire\\, but the emotional motivations for each character to join a side and continue fighting are pretty non-existent. The Rebel Alliance are \\\"chaotic good\\\" and the Empire is \\\"lawful evil\\,\\\" and that's about where it starts and ends. They fight because they hate each other\\, and they hate each other because they fight.\\n\\nSimple details like these were rushed through to get back to the action scenes. Stilted dialogue and British accents (?) from one-dimensional characters did not create relatable characters which the audience could emotionally connect with. I couldn't really understand what the story arc was supposed to be. It felt like a series of events\\, one after the next\\, just kept happening\\, with little explanation as to how they connected. It was almost circumstantial or tangential plot development.\\n\\nThe newer movies (with the exception of VII) have really irked me because they are such a departure from what made Episodes IV-VI great. The original trilogy had excellent story structure\\, relatable characters with complex personalities and emotional dimensions\\, and a great mix between action and character\/plot development. In contrast\\, the prequel series focused mostly on action scenes\\, had an empty and rather uninteresting plot\\, and was written with one-dimensional characters who rarely strayed from their default plot devices.\\n\\nDeus ex machina seemed to be used in EVERY battle scene. A new technology or ability is suddenly conjured from the ether to save the good guy and destroy the bad guy. It's such a trope plot device to use\\, and it's rarely done well. For example\\, the X-Wing now has a slingshot-effect boost engine? BB-8 fries itself in a circuit board to repair a gun to destroy the last surface cannon\\, just in the nick of time (and BB-8 lives)? The Rebel Alliance rolls out a new ship (B\/SF-17 bomber) never seen before\\, and one survives just barely to destroy the enemy ship? The Rebel Alliance rolls out yet another ship (Raddus) never seen before\\, and it has blaster shields\\, while no other Rebel or Imperial ship ever has? The ships have fuel that can run empty? Leia can resurrect herself? I couldn't even follow the story anymore\\, so I just got up and walked out after that.\\n\\nAlso that \\\"comedic relief\\\" bit about Dameron \\\"holding\\\" for Hux... UGH that was terrible.","true":true}
