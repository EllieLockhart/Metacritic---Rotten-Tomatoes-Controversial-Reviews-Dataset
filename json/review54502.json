Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and have been a huge fan since watching it as a young boy. I liked Force Awakens and loved Rogue One. The Last Jedi however left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanted to love it so very much as I was finally getting to see my favorite character\\, Luke Skywalker\\, get some much needed screen time. The movie unfortunately was riddled with plot holes and bad writing. One of the things that have been irritating to me about these new movies is the lack of the aliens we came to know and love from the first six films. Twi'leks\\, Rodians\\, Ithorians\\, Devaronian\\, Bith\\, Gamorrean\\, Trandoshan\\, and Mon Calamari to name a few are not seen in the new films at all. In The Last Jedi they go so far as to kill off a famous Admiral off screen and showing little to no regard for him what so ever. \\n\tAn example of bad writing in the movie was that of the entire chase sequence between the First Order and the Resistance. Some how a group of large star destroyers with huge engines could not overtake the small resistance spacecraft. It seems the writers do not understand space and how weight has no meaning. \\n\tThere are several more instances of what was wrong with the movie but I will leave that to the many wonderful reviews on youtube such as the AngryJoeshow.","true":true}
