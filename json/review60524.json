We played it straight after TLOU1 so that was still fresh in our minds...and what an intense continuation of the story this was!From a gameplay point of view I didn\u2019t want it to end - I loved the strategising and problem solving\\, with the constant compulsion to loot and craft the weapons needed to survive\\, as well as looking for creative ways to take down enemies using stealth.But from a storyline point of view I was anxious to reach the end so I could find out what happened!This story was COMPELLING. The writers and performers did an amazing job at creating characters who I both cared deeply about\\, while shaking my head at their major flaws and poor choices.The score of fully-realised secondary characters was just as impressive\\, each with their own equally compelling journeys.  This game was not simply \u2018good guy bad guy\u2019\\, this was exploring very real (painfully real) human beings in a world where the infection isn\u2019t the worst enemy nor are the infected the worst type of monsters. But that just made the moments of human connection\\, humour and kindness all the more powerful.This game was brilliant. Extremely violent\\, to be fair\\, but also incredibly beautiful\\, from the design\\, to the music\\, to the themes and characters that are going to stay with me for a long time.Strongly recommend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
