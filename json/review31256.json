{"101487":168289,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things\\, so many... things wrong here. \\nSPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING! \\nJust saying.\\nOK\\, How in the hell did Princess Leia pull off that Mary Poppins in space sh@t??!!! seems a bit overpowered\\, even for an experienced Jedi\\, which she is not. c'mon!\\nLuke in a super awkward scene\\, the milking of the Seacow\\, ugh\\, so weird! NO! Just NO.\\nPoe not following orders cost the rebellion thousands of lives!!! The First Order learns Holdo's plan of escape from Finn & Rose's horrible rabbit-trail storyline. Why? Because Holdo (Laura Dern) doesn't want to tell the #1 pilot of the rebellion the escape plan. \\nThat casino scene was so completely irrelevant\\, fueling the political preachy theme of warmongers\\, that continues on to also include saving some space llamas\\, etc. A complete waste of screen time!\\nThe First order has tech that can destroy a planet\\, but can't make a laser that can shoot past 1 mile of space?!! This leading to the slowest\\, most mundane space chase in sci-fi history. Just awful. \\nAnd Holdo staying aboard the ship\\, that for some reason\\, doesn't have auto pilot\\, even though every scene with her on the ship she just stood there\\, as if it had auto-pilot\\, up until the warp speed suicide scene.\\nKylo & Rey's telepathic thing was ok at first\\, but quickly seemed like txting\\, repetitious enough that even Rey at one point says\\, \\\"not now Kylo\\, i'm busy\\\" lol!\\nThe 'dark side' hole in the island was so dumb\\, with a million Rey's snapping their fingers for 10 minutes lacked any kind of depth or talent\\, again\\, very bad writing.\\nSnoke's death was so anticlimactic\\, giving us no explanation of his existence\\, or relevance\\, a waste of a great character! They basically Darth-Mauled us!!! And no reasoning on how he could be so all powerful\\, but not sense the intent of Kylo! ugh.\\nLuke almost killing his own nephew\\, even if it was a brief instant\\, is so badly explained\\, its not believable at all. Luke's death is completely anticlimactic\\, it looked as tho it was edited in post\\, as if the sunrise killed him?!! lol. \\nYoda appearing to Luke with the warning that he failed kylo\\, he cannot fail Rey. From that point forward there is no interaction between Luke and Rey\\, that is just\\, again\\, lazy writing! Rey makes the right choice\\, but Luke has no influence on that at all.\\nOk\\, so now for the good stuff:\\nLoved the Luke hologram trick\\, didn't see that coming at all.\\nSnoke's deathscene\\, altho my complaints still stand\\, was great to see how that played out.\\nAny scene with Kylo and\/or Rey\\, they are both amazing! \\nSo... basically it's the death of this franchise\\, leaving me with 0 desire to see any further films. The Writers and director should be ashamed of themselves.\\n(there's more complaints\\, but i just can't think of them right now. lol)\\nSign the petition to remove it from Star Wars cannon!","true":true}
