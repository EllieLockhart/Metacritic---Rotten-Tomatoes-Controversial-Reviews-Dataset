Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but plot holes you could fly the death star through.  Luke was not done justice at all.  As Mark Hamill stated way back he disagreed with how Luke was portrayed and I can see why.   I could list quite a few more things that made this atrocious but I'm sure you'll see it for yourself.","true":true}
