Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Come on dudes. Luke Skywalker is a hero. He is the HOPE of the galaxy. Not a grumpy old man. The whole casino stuff was dumb. Princess \/ General Leia is awesome\\, but not a floating statue. Weird. And a trilogy doesn't mean three unrelated stories with the same characters. No build. Poe is cool. Rose is corny.","true":true}
