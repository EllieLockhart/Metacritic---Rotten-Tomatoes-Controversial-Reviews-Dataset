Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Star Wars movie was just ok. Watch it and you will see why. Just old characters with too much focus on them(Luke and Leah). Get new characters and stay with them ( this is the future of Star Wars)","true":true}
