Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my least favorite Star Wars film by a mile. \\n\\nWhile it is no doubt well filmed\\, the choices that Rian Johnson made for the characters were horrible\\, and the decision to throw away much of what The Force Awakens set up is unforgivable. If The Rise of Skywalker fails to conclude the sage\\, it is this movie's fault. \\n\\nThe three main characters: Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rey do not have any bonding moments during this film\\, and Poe and Rey don't even meet for the first time until the very end of it. Whoever Mark Hamill was forced to play in this film was not Luke Skywalker. Rian and his team made the dumb choice to leave Leia alive at the end of the film even though Carrie Fisher had passed away. I mean\\, if Paramount is willing to spend months of time and tens of millions of dollars to fix Sonic the hedgehog's face just to make fans happy\\, I think Disney could have took some time and paid whatever it cost to reshoot some scenes so that JJ\\, or whoever was slated to direct Episode 9 at the time\\, wouldn't have to solve the problem. \\n\\nIn all this film destroyed the Disney trilogy\\, and nearly the whole franchise of Star Wars and Rian Johnson should never be forgiven for that. Though he is a fine filmmaker and I would suggest watching his newest film Knives Out if you have not already.\\n\\nMy Review: D","true":true}
