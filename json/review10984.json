Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen all Star Wars movies on their theatrical release (yes\\, i'm an old fart) this is by far the worst:\\n\\n- Poor script\\n- Poor acting\\n- Even more than episode 7\\, it's a pure Disney money making vehicle mixing arbitrary pledges of the original episodes 4 - 6 together.\\n- On the bright side\\, SFX are pretty good. But that's about all positive credit I can give.\\n- And something I can't really forgive: Rubbing SJW nonsense into your face as a big No No.\\n\\nThis movie really destroyed Star Wars for me and I most probably won't see any other flick of this franchise.","true":true}
