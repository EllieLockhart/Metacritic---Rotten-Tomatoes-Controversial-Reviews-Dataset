Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Eyes rolled practically every 5 minutes. Horrified by it's treatment of the series. It's efforts in subversion lazy and inconsistent in ways which are too numerous to mention and long portions are simply boring.","true":true}
