Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. This film is a giant middle finger to true Star Wars fans who follow the lore.\\n2. This film is dripping with regressive identity politics.\\n3. The director had no intention of using some of his characters\\, so he sent them on a useless 40 minute mission which has no impact on anything.\\n4. Rey is still such an obvious Mary Sue\\, it's painful to watch.\\n5. I would sit through all 3 prequels before watching this again.","true":true}
