Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic visuals\\, some good action scenes ... but a lot of gaping\\, illogical plotholes (e.g.: Holdo not telling Poe about her plan...)\\, many inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise (Forceghost-Yoda maipulating the weather ...)\\, some uttery sensless scenes (Rose \\\"saving\\\" Finn from \\\"saving\\\" the Resistance\\, Luke \\\"milking\\\" the strange alien\\, and so on ...) and a general lack of knowledge (or utter disregard for) the \\\"Star Wars\\\"-Lore ... all in all\\, the movie still had potential\\, and visually it had some great scenes\\, but the story was all over the place\\, and in the end there was so much dissapointment: Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, Luke\\, the utter failure to present the first Order as something to be afraid of\\, especially with Hux and (again) Phasma ... so much WASTED potential.\\nAll it amounts to\\, is a catastrophe\\, for the franchise\\, the lore\\, ... and the fans.","true":true}
