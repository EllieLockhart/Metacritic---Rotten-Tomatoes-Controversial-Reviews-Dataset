Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just when I thought the prior star wars reboot couldn't get any worse it does.  Although the reboot had speical effects and forward moving and interesting plot (even if it was very redundanent) This one only has a quarter of important sciences that excite. Even those are not fully executed or developed. \\nMost of it is just worthless filler- some bossy girl admiral that wants to evacuate and boring Chinese girl saving flinn  as he fights old stormtrooper nemesis that nobody really remembered. Most of story character and relationships should be quick cut scenes.\\n\\nOverall a regular joe thrown together script and actors that seem like they have given up on the movie too with horrible lines and no feelings. 40 plus years and they give this mundane and  regurgitated plot that isn't even close to the originals","true":true}
