Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never been more excited to see a movie than I was for The Last Jedi\\, and after seeing it I can honestly say that I have never been more disappointed or upset at a director and a film company (Disney). This movie was a betrayal of everything that made Star Wars the giant that it is today. Rian Johnson has personally disrespected everything we\\, as fans\\, loved about the story. Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed of herself for signing off on a movie with so many plot holes and inconsistencies that are at a level never seen before in any previous Star Wars film. Star Wars fans everywhere should feel almost as betrayed and disappointed as Mark Hamill is because of the abuse and disrespect that his character received in this film. Shame on you\\, Disney.","true":true}
