Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally a copy and paste of previous star wars movies cut and stitched together with terrible attempts at humor. \\n\\nSuper embarrassing how far this franchise has fallen and how horrible Hollywood has become that apparently they can not allow original scripts. Every movie in a series has to be a copy of the previous version. God forbid they take a risk and write something new or allow the plot to develop. \\n\\nStill waiting for iron Man 15. It will be the exact same story line as the first.","true":true}
