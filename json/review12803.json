Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not enjoy Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It felt like a complete disconnect from the original trilogy\\, as well as The Force Awakens. The casino subplot was completely unnecessary and such a waste of storytelling. Luke was simply treated as a throw away character. I was bored. I was so bored\\, I was on my phone most of the time\\, and I LOVE Star Wars. It's such a shame that Star Wars has come to this.","true":true}
