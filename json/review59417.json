The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The production values of this game are top notch. Graphics\\, environments\\, music and acting are great. One of the best of the current generation. Unfortunately the game is narrative driven and the writing is shoddy at best. The story is structured poorly\\, the characters are shallow and act in incomprehensible fashion. My idea of a great game is to be put the player  in a world to make decisions and see how they play out. In this game I\u2019m put into the world to do what the writers want\\, without real agency.  For a big portion of the game I\u2019m forced to act in a way I don\u2019t want to\\, and even worse\\, play a character I don\u2019t want to play with.The gameplay itself is very similar to the original\\, almost no innovation\\, and it feels both unfair and illogical at times. It is not fair that I\u2019m against a dozen NPC:s with a gun\\, but each time I can get only 1-2 billets from them. The scarcity is artificial and does not make sense. Playing with the Abby character\\, a solider for several years\\, is too similar to playing with Ellie. For some reason she learns about crafting\\, gun improvements and close combat skills only on the days I\u2019m playing the character\\, the exact days when Ellie is in town. Unrelated to my rating\\, I find Sony\/Naughty Dog PR and marketing decisions suspicious. Not allowing the reviewers to talk about the whole game and misleading gamers on the content of the game was not cool\\, almost like a bait-and-switch. Given the game they made\\, I kinda understand\\, but can not approve.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
