Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful\\, awful movie.  Serious pacing issues; non-sensical scenes; plot holes; terrible jokes; ridiculous new characters.  These are just some of the wreckage this movie brought the audience.\\n\\nI did not care for many of the scenes that most other reviewers are speaking of (Superman Leia\\, bombs dropping in space\\, Luke as a hermit).  But what I really did not like was the new character\\, Rose.  She honestly ruined this movie for me.  I thought her character annoying and the actress to be subpar at best\\, and that is putting it nicely.  And\\, she was in quite a bit of the movie.  By the time she gave her inane speech about war and capitalism\\, I almost got up and left the theater.  \\n\\nAnother issue I had with this film is the leftist dialogue.  I do not know why anyone thought it would work in a Star Wars film\\, because it didn't.  I really found it to be insulting.\\n\\nI cannot fathom who wrote this script and who gave it the green light.  It needs a serious overhaul to be even considered a decent movie.  BUT\\, it should be stripped of the right to call itself a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
