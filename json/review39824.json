Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is a really horrible star wars movie.I dont know who this director thought he was doing here but he utterly destroyed this franchise forever\\, the whole story is in shatters now. As i was watching it i actually wanted to like it\\, convinced myself it was ok and that the poe rambling your mother as movie started \\,like it was spaceballs was ok too.I grimaced when this happened as I did when leia floated in space dead from being obliterated on bridge of her ship and also when snoke was killed in an instant. I know when movie ended myself and my daughter were just in shock though about what we had just seen.The rest of people in our showing of the movie walked out angry and total disappointed in what they had just seen. Lets be clear this wasnt just a bad star wars movie but rather a destruction of the entire star wars sage that will live on in dvd and digital form forever. When a future viewer years from now views these movies they will view this with disgust as poe gets on screen and makes your mother jokes and outwits the fleet. This director should be utterly ashamed of himself as should the so called professional viewers. Their was NOTHING GOOD about this entire film !!!","true":true}
