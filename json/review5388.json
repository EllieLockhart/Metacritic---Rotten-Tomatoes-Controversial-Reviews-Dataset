Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite all the negative things about this movie... I personally find it phenomenal. When the original trilogy first came to be\\, people didn't know what to expect so we all happily took them in\\, whereas the backlash to this movie derives from \\\"fans\\\" not getting exactly what they wanted. For me\\, it felt like a genuine Star Wars movie\\, carrying unexpected\\, exhilarating turns and sequences worth watching 100 times.","true":true}
