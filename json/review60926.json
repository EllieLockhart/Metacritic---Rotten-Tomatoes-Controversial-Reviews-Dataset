The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It's a shame that all the hard work the developers and artist put in this game was overshadowed due to the disappointing story line.  When it comes to scenery\\, voice acting and acting in general\\, the lightning\\, all the mechanics and how well every detail in the game was amazingly thought out\\, truly I was in awe for all of those things\\, but it\u00b4s A STORY BASED GAME\\, and it\u00b4s sums up to nothing when the story is disappointing. Now I expected to Joel to die in this second part\\, I was ready for that\\, but to kill him that way? I got mad at the fact that Joel and Tommy walked into a group like that without any hesitation\\,  they survived for years\\, they know not to trust people\\, but they did and that was so out of character from both. Also this games forces you to do the worst things when you\u00b4re playing as Ellie\\, and then tries to be the savior with Abby with a hidden agenda to get you as a player to like Abby which fails completely on my part. Also those  5+ hours of playing Abby were so boring\\, I found myself not even  searching for collectibles and just wanted to get it over with. Lev and Yara were interesting characters which lighted up the mood when playing as Abby. Also hated the fact that you have to beat up Ellie. Spent the whole first game trying to protect Ellie so that they make us beat her on the second? what is all that about?  I wish we had more character development with Jesse and Dina\\, they had great potential. Like that bonfire scene talked about Ellie mentioned before playing the guitar\\, I would have loved to see how they played out. that way we had a better idea of how good Ellie had it and how much she cared for Dina and threw it all away for revenge. that would have been more impactful  than the manipulative story line of  trying to make Abby the better person when she is in fact the worst. She takes pleasure on pain\\, Ellie got traumatized. I'm honestly disappointed.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
