Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Always have been a big Star Wars fan and completely can't believe how they destroyed the legacy with this movie. They really just crapped on Luke Skywalker and totally turned his character into absolutely nothing. I knew it too! I said they are gonna kill off Luke and totally make him out to be nothing! Luke Skywalker is Star Wars! You made him a bum hermit on a island milking some obscene aliens nasty boobs for disgusting milk! It's a total shame. Why does he die? What kills him! Old age? He not that old. If you kill Luke Skywalker he has to die epic. For that fact if you kill freaking Han Solo make it epic! Who that ever watched and loved Star Wars could ever read the script to this and go yeah sounds great! It's trash. It ruins Star Wars for so many old fans! I just can't see how to fix it now. Say it was a dream. Force hallucination! Time travel back and start over. Something. Please!","true":true}
