Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why some people were disappointed by TLJ\\, especially the way it portrayed Luke. On consideration and second viewing though I enjoyed it much more. I've accepted that though it's not what I wanted to see\\, Luke has to behave like he does in this film as it's the only thing that makes sense given what happened at the end of TFA.\\n\\nHighlight: lightsabre fight\\, Rey\/ ren interplay\\, Lifting rocks!\\nNot so good: anticlimatic and somewhat confusing end to a beloved character. \\n\\nPs. The return to binary good\/ bad by the end was a bit disappointing also. There was some juicy grey areas thrown up in the middle that just got thrown out again at the end.","true":true}
