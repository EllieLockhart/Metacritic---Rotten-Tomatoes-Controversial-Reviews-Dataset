Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an absolute joy to watch. This movie explored in depth the characters and as a full-out Star Wars fan it reminded me why I love Star Wars so much. The character development impactful storyline and a few jokes along the way. I watched this movie at the midnight screening and it kept me on edge the whole time even when it was 12 in the morning. This movie is definitely a must-see and is awesome.","true":true}
