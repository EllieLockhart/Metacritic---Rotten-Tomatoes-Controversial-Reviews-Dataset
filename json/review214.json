Lack of budget is so clear in some areas. Facial animations are poor and side quests are lacking of voice. However\\, I think I just spoiled by big games like Witcher 3.\rBut after I got immersed by story and 80s atmosphere I could not stop playing. Story is good and much better than your usual video game story\\, Gameplay is repetitive but badass soundtrack makes it feel cool. What impressed me the most that side quest are so interesting and hilarious\\, Each side quest had unique story and its not your usual go there and kill that and than bring me that. No. Even gameplay is different here. I spent 50 hours with that and probably will spend more. That game is like breath of fresh air. Loved it. I did not give that game 10 because if repetitive fighting gameplay at times and technical issues.\r\rLooks like its golden times to be owner of PS4. So many cool games are coming.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
