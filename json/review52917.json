Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An extremely flashy but ultimately depthless -- and even insulting -- movie.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi contradicts almost everything set-up in the previous films\\, and even the previous two trilogies on occasion. It treats fans with what seems to be deliberate disrespect\\, not by subverting their theories\\, but by simply saying that none of the questions ever mattered in the first place.\\n\\nIf a New Hope\\, The Empire Strikes Back\\, and Return of the Jedi were the personified in the numbers 1\\, 2\\, and 3\\, while the prequels were 4\\, 5\\, 6; The Force Awakens would be 1.2. And The Last Jedi would simply be -2. The Force Awakens simply offers a mildly altered version of ANH\\, while TLJ deliberately seeks to do the OPPOSITE of its predecessor...without meaningfully changing anything.\\n\\nPunctuated with puerile humor and 6th grade philosophy\\, this was one of the least pleasant movie-going experiences I have ever had.","true":true}
