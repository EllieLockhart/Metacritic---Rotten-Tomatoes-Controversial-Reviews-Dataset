Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why oh why\\, I couldn't recognize my childhood hero in this movie. The fact he raise the sword against Ben Solo is the stupidest and the poorest script writing I ever see in modern movies. Maybe Rain Johnson hate Luke Skywalker\\, or doesn't really watch the original Star Wars movies. \\n\\nAs for Disney and Ms Kathleen Kennedy\\, well done and you both deserved to be in hell for approving this. \\n\\nMark Hamill: \\\"Remember kids. It's not important if it's of high quality\\, only if it makes money.\\\" My heart would always cry everytime this echo in my mind. \\n\\nOther reasons I rate this movie as the worst Star Wars movie(in fact\\, I would like to not acknowledge this as Star Wars movie at all):-\\n\\n1. Unnecessary love story between Fin and Rose\\n2. Lame and low jokes\\n3. No lightsabers fight from Luke\\n4. Stupid and boring casino scene\\, lots of people snoring during that.\\n5. Underutilized several characters such as Luke\\, Snoke and Phasma\\n6. Killing off Luke before he can make a bigger impact for the entire trilogy.\\n7. Dubious decision of the resistance leader\\, in fact Fin and Rose will not have to gone through that unnecessary finding code breaker plot if she has communicated with Poe.\\n8. Hyperjump into snoke ship couldn't be done faster\/ done cleverly by remote.\\n9. 1 X-Wing took on a Dreadnought is really dumb ass written and doesn't make sense.\\n10. Rey become overly powered in quick fashion doesn't make sense.\\n\\nAll above happened is because done by poor writting\\, by people who are fundamentally not fully understand the whole lore\\, aka Rian Johnson. And approved by management of a company who seek only quick return on the franchise\\, Ms Kathleen Kennedy and Disney.\\n\\nAnd that's why we have  EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2 as well.","true":true}
