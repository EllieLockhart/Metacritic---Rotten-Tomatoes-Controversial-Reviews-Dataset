Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"honestly this movie does have it issues\\, I feel like the second act lost me a bit. The entire second act is nothing but one long filler\\, just to give key characters something to do which amounted to nothing and no payoff. Every issue I have falls within this point of the movie. The first was ok and the third act was amazing. The battles are ok\\, the story in the whole does very little to advance the overall narrative of the three part saga\\, the twist and turns in the story was meh at best. Id give it a 2 stars cause you have to endure so much filler\/not important moments before u finally get to the good stuff. Honestly\\, I feel like this hurt the saga as a whole due.","true":true}
