Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were a few cool scenes\\, such as the fight in Snoke's room.  But there are so many nail-on-chalkboard scenes that they overshadowed the decent parts.\\n\\nI liked Kylo Ren better than I did in The Force Awakens.  I am looking forward to seeing him progress more in the next movie too.  I also liked Rey but wish we got a different look into her backstory than what we were given.  It just didn't seem to jive with the direction that TFA was going.  Again\\, maybe we'll get more in the next movie.\\n\\nIf they were to take out the social commentary and omit Rose and all her scenes from this movie\\, I would give it another 2 or 3 stars.","true":true}
