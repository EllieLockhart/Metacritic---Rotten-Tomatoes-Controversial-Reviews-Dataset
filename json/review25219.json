Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals can\u2019t cover up the inept writing and plot progression. Disney is hellbent on invalidating the original trilogy so they can pump out a generic \u201cMarvel\u201d style of Star Wars movies year after year. Great job Disney\\, you\u2019ve ruined a beloved film series and it\u2019s several well crafted characters.","true":true}
