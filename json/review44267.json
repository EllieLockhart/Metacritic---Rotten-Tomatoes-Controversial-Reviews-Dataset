Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long it needed some more editing in the middle scenes (the Maz Kanata scene was utterly pointless and unnecessary). Snoke needed more explanation - at the end of ROTJ the Empire was in tatters. How did the First Order rise up? Kylo Ren still looks like a nerd and is laughable as chief bad guy. It was nice to see Yoda but why didn't Obi-wan turn up. And why didn't they turn up earlier to talk Luke out of his isolation? General Hux totally annoying by yelling orders all the time. Overall still more entertaining than The Force Awakens but still nowhere near as fun or enjoyable as the Original Trilogy.","true":true}
