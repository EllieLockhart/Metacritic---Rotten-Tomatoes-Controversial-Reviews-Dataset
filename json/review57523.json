Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an incredible movie. After the initial action\\, it is a little slow\\, but the scenes with Ray and Luke are perfect. People having an issue with it not honoring what Star Wars is are crazy. It calls back to episodes 5 and 6 while still remaining unique\\, fresh\\, and unpredictable. It feels like a Star Wars movie from its epic visuals and lightsaber battles\\, to its bantering comedy. Watch this movie. Now. You don't want to miss out\\, and you don't want to be overly critical and psyche yourself into not liking it for no reason.","true":true}
