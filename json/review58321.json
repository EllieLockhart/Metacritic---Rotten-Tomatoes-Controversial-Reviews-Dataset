Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A confused movie that doesn't know if it wants to be a compelling original story or a pandering\\, unnecessary social commentary riddled with poorly-timed and often low-brow humor. \\n\\nI for one honestly did not mind my expectations being subverted for where the plot was heading\\, I like being surprised\\, it was just how inconsequential and uninteresting (and often nonsensical) it all became was what bothered me. As others have said this film feels like a 'filler episode' which is disappointing considering parts of The Last Jedi were downright astonishing. Also\\, some humor definitely has its place in Star Wars\\, it's a fun science fantasy movie after all\\, 'your mama' jokes and relentless slapstick do not\\, save that for the cartoons. \\n\\nAdditionally\\, this is the first time I've watched a Star Wars movie that made me truly feel like a was being spoon-fed a product (aside from the prequels). The friggin' LEGO movie felt less like a commercial than a lot of The Last Jedi. Hurry kids\\, rush out and buy PORGS! They're cute AND funny! (I actually had no problem with those cute little guys\\, until it became apparent they were simply another vector for forced humor and merchandising) \\n\\nThis is a movie made by a committee and it's painfully obvious. As a kid who grew up with the original trilogy and later enduring the lackluster prequels this is the first time I walked out of a Star Wars movie feeling almost no excitement for future installments and instead worry for the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
