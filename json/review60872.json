We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Just so you know\\, I'm not review bombing. I will not get into the identity politics aspects of the game. I will just address the story. I play the first The Last of Us a couple of years after it came out. After hearing how good it was I purchased the remastered version for the PS4 play it and absolutely fell in love with Joel and Ellie. I felt heartbroken when I saw sam turn\\, for then Henry to take his life after killing his younger brother. I put myself in his shoes. I probably wouldn't have been able to pull the trigger. That moment stuck with me for a very long time. Just like the death of Sarah\\, the ranch scene\\, the time Ellie saves joel and Joel's learns to trust her. Those are the reason I loved The Last of Us. Because of the emotional character build up that the game allowed me to experience. Then came the announcement of this game. I was so excited about this game I wanted it the day I heard about it. Then I heard about the leaks. Given I went out of my way to play this game spoiler free\\, by staying away from comment sections\\, staying away from Twitter\\, Instagram\\, any youtube content that contained spoilers. I wanted to experience this game with no input from other people\\, and I succeeded. I managed to stay away from all spoilers\\, and experience it for myself. Played through it saw how Joel has his guard down and falls into a trap by literally putting him self in the middle of the room with compleatly unknown strangers. This is the man who ran over another because he felt like there was an ambush planed\\, and he lets that happen to him? Come on Naughty Dog you know better. You made the first game why is the original have such good writing and for the send off of a beloved character\\, you did this so lazily. Then you expect me to care about the person who killed him? No that's not how this works. Then Ellie goes off on a murderous rampage killing everyone in her way just to let her live? Ellie has lost everything and she gets to have a happy ending? I thought you loved these characters. I'm so disappointed with the story hat I don't know if I ever want to support any future endeavors. And yes I know I'm just one person but\\, i was a dedicated fan of this game and yeah I'm not owed anything\\, I have no entitlement to anything. And neither do you. I hope it was worth it to you guys to ruin such great characters for who knows what.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
