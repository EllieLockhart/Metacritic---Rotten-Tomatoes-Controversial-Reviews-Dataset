Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many missed opportunities in this movie. And the comedy was forced and made it feel like a Marvel movie. Not needed in Star Wars or wanted. Sad to see what they've done to a once proud franchise.","true":true}
