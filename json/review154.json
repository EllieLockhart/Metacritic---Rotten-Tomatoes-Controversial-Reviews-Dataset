Based the reviews below I delved into this new world of Yakuza. At first I was apprehensive\\, thought perhaps I had made a bad decision\\, but I kept on... and oh my days\\, this game has immersed me beyond reproach. The story is epic\\, I could have never guessed the way it would turn out. The side stories\\, the mini games\\, the club management\\, the real estate.   The laughs I had at the telephone dating. Sega have outdone themselves\\, it is such a shame a game of this calibre has no media coverage in the west. Yes the graphics are not the best and not cutting edge... But if you want pointless eye candy that looks good with no substance then purchase one of the many other titles currently available. For a newbie Yakuza player\\, this has been amazing\\, entertaining\\, funny\\, addictive and immersive. Sega\\, a hat tip from my childhood with Sonic\\, and a hat tip as an adult for Yakuza... In a word\\, brilliant!! This game can only deserve a 10\/10 from me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
