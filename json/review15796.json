Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars\\, and normally I love most things Disney.  But\\, together these things equate to a shit sandwich.\\n\\nI wanted to fall in love all over again with this saga as I did after watching The Force Awakens.  I didn't .  I left the theater underwhelmed.  \\n\\nBut\\, the more I thought about this movie\\, the more I've grown to actually hate it.  I won't get into the dozens of reasons why\\, as other reviewers here have done a terrific job pointing out the many flaws in the movie.  I'll just say that it's been 2 weeks since I've seen it and I'm still fuming.  It's a slow burn that ignites every time I think of the potential wasted.","true":true}
