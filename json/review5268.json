Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely a better movie than TFA\\, it's more creative\\, more original and expands it's universe better then any other star wars movie has ever done. \\nYes it has its flaws but the good parts are waaay better then the bad ones.","true":true}
