Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At it's best\\, The Last Jedi has some of the greatest moments in the saga's history. At it's worst\\, it's spends a little too much time on a pointless plot line\\, and some of its humor fails. It's not a perfect movie. If the Star Wars universe is as important to you as your closest loved ones\\, it's possible you may be upset at the directions Rian Johnson took this chapter. But it's important before seeing The Last Jedi to remove expectation\\, escape the hype\\, and see it for what it is. It's fun\\, it's new\\, and it's worth the watch.","true":true}
