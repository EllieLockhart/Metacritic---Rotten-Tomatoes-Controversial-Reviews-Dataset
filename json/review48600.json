Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WORSE than The Phantom Menace.  20+ plot holes\\, and many plots that were great in the first movie\\, got snuffed out here. Whoever wrote this script\\, needs to return to writing school. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens and Rogue One were awesome.  This\\, was not.","true":true}
