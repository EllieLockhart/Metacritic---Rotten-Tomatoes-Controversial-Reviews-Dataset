Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally it just a worse copy of the Empire Strikes Back. If it was a paper for high school and they ran the script through one of those make sure this is not plagiarism sites it would literally come back 90% plagiarized. Disney need to come up with new ideas or just stop all together at this point. Not worth see if you want to see it just watch the Empire Strikes Back and you will know what this movie is about.
