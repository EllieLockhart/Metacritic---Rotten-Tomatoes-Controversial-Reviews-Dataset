Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't normally write reviews\\, but I have two reasons behind this. One\\, I genuinely enjoyed the movie. I was honestly terrified that they were gonna just repeat the formula and have more hands fly and more \\\"no\\, I am your father moments\\,\\\" but none of that happened. It's the freshest take I've seen in a long time and I had lots of fun watching it.\\n\\nSecond\\, I have seen dozens upon dozens of reviews where people just put one star or no stars without even seeing the movie. Reviews where people straight up just make a prediction for how bad they think it will be and just leave it at that. This movie has problems for certain\\, but it is certainly not one star level. The user score right now is way too low and this movie deserves more than a rating which is deflated by idiotic reviewers who can't tell the difference between not \\\"interested\\\" and \\\"rating.\\\"","true":true}
