Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge let-down. Disney's not catering to the fans who have been invested in this universe that's now growing increasingly shallow in terms of backstory and believability. Snoke and the apparently nonexistent(?!) Knights of Ren are a couple of examples; I am angrily starting to not care about all of this film's characters. How can I\\, when I don't even know anything about them! This movie is so frustrating!!! Disappointment\\, Disney! :(","true":true}
