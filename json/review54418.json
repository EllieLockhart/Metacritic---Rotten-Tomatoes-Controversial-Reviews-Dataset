Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theatre ready to barf and brought me almost to tears. It took 2 years of waiting to see this and it ruined 40 years of the Star Wars chain on movies. The pink haired women decides to make Poe look like an idiot and not tell him the plan. After the Resistance ruled for 30 years their left with 1000 people after episode 7...WHAT? Leia is now superman and Rey brings Luke to his knees who is one of the best Jedi in the galaxy\\, she had 0 training and only discovered the force 3 days ago\\, considering the Last Jedi took place right after the force awakens\\, porgs and cool effects cover up the stupid useless plot\\, which didn't add but only take away from my beloved Star Wars. Finn and Rose want a code breaker and go to jail which happens to be the cell where another code breaker is\\, WOW! Ten kills a man that choked hux through a hologram through the galaxy and he took reys lightsaber and hit her in the head with it.","true":true}
