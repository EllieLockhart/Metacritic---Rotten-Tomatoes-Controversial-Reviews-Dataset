Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its full of plot holes\\, they give NO SHITS about the plotlines established in \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" (knights of Ren\\, Snoke\\, Rey's bloodline\\, Luke leaving a map) and they give literally give us a filler arc with Finn and a random asian girl. So much more to say but ey\\, im cripplingly depressed now.","true":true}
