Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stop whining\\, it was an amazing film to me (Star Wars fan) and my wife (not the biggest SW fan). Manage your expectations\\, I limited my expectation with 1 trailer. One. No pre-movie interviews\\, no extended trailers\\, no chit-chat. Absolutely loved it.","true":true}
