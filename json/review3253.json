Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful story arcs (Rey becoming more hopeful despite [possibly supposedly] learning she descends from regular folk; Poe learning that he doesn't have all the answers and has to overcome being humbled; Luke saving those he loves\\, rather than killing those he hates\\, Rose doing the same\\, Finn learning to put the group's needs over his own\\, but to also understand that Rey has her own path)\\, plus showing the evil for what it is (Kylo Ren being a petulant pissant who whines about what he can't get (sounds like some supposed Star Wars fans...). So dang good!","true":true}
