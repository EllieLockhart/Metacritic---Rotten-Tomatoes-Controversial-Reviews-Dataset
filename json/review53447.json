Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney really disneyfied this one. I didn't count but I'm sure it had more jokes than the original trilogy put together. I not watching Star Wars for the jokes\\, I'm watching it for the story. The story was OK\\, but not great. Just like the force awakens it felt like a remix of episode 5. There were some cool scenes\\, some awesome scenes\\, and some scenes that had me going why\\, why\\, WHY! I'm not going to rush out to see it again.","true":true}
