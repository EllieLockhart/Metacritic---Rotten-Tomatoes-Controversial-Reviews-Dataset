Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know why other people are rating this so low. Some hack on the fact that Disney took over and \u201cruined\u201d Star Wars\\, but I don\u2019t feel this way. I think they saved this series by bringing the story writing to a more intelligent level that Lucas is not capable of realizing. ","true":true}
