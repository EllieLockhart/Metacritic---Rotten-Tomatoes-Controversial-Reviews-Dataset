Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is hot garbage.  Utter SJW political nonsense permeated every facet of this shallow husk of a storyline.  Save your money\\, and more importantly boycott Disney.  They absolutely destroyed one of the best cinematic franchises ever created.","true":true}
