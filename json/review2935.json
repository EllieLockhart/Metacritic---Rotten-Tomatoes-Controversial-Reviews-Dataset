Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A worthy entry in the Star Wars franchise that abandons the cookie-cutter style of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and takes the story in a new and exciting direction. Plus\\, seeing Kylo Ren become a fully-fledged antagonist has been so refreshing in our era of superhero films with half-baked villains.","true":true}
