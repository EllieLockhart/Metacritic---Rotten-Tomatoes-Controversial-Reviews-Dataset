Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so disappointed I feel like i was teased strung along. I needed more back story on Snoke\\, I needed more Knights of Ren\\, I needed more  light saber duels\\, I needed less pointless characters\\, I needed Luke's epic light saber duels. Maybe\\, I'm just nit picking but genuinely feel that Disney is playing with our heads and I am seriously done investing in the mythology of Star Wars. I need a star wars break. Maybe\\, that's what Disney want's. I\\\"m so split I'm exhausted.","true":true}
