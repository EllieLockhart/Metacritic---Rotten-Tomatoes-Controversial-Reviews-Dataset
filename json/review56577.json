Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an Awesome thrilling spectacle of a Movie! Forget that bad reviews\\, I don\u2019t get the cult followers that get upset when the plot doesn\u2019t go the way they thought it was supposed to be\\, this movie explores many different stories and angles\\, the acting is superb and the special effects are incredible\\, some people hated the humor but they forget the old ones also had cheesy jokes\\, i believe all of the haters have idolized the old ones so much that they forget\\, they had flaws too\\, And i am not a new fan that just started watching star wars\\, i love all of the movies\\, I even like the prequals with all of their ups and downs. Believe me this movie will blow your mind! Now if you believe that the new movies should be a copy pf the old ones then you will hate this one and anything else that\u2019s not a ripoff of the originals\\, for example i really liked force awakens but it wasn\u2019t very original it was like an updated copy of episode IV\\, and maybe thats why so many die hard fans loved it\\, but The last Jedi goes to places where no other star wars movie has gone before and that to me it\u2019s awesome\\, it makes the franchise feel fresh and sets up the story for what I think could be and Epic Episode 9. go watch it with an open mind and it will blow you away!
