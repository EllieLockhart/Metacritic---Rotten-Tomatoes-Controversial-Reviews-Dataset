Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't get all the hate from trolls online. It's an amazing film\\, with great action\\, great performances\\, and lots of surprises. There's no pleasing the whiny fanboys\\, they complained about the prequels for not being like the Original Trilogy\\, they complained about Force Awakens\/Rogue One for being too similar to the Original Trilogy\\, now they complain about The Last Jedi for being too different. Those morons should just go home and watch the Original Trilogy for the rest of their lives\\, you clearly won't be satisfied with anything else.","true":true}
