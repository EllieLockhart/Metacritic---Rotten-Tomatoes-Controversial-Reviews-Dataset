Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is fundamentally broken.\\nThe forced attempts at humor\\, the bizarre and unbalanced way the heroes and villains operate under completely different rules (Only the good guys' ships have shields? REALLY??)\\, and the way so many of the dangling plot threads from 'The Force Awakens' are just thrown away with a visible contempt by the director... all of this combines to leave me sort of hating this movie.\\nAnd that's horrible\\, because I LOVE Star Wars.\\nBut having seen this\\, my faith in this franchise is severely damaged\\, to the point where I'm unsure if I'll be paying to see the next one.","true":true}
