Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film out of all 9 movies. I'll try to give it some points. Decent battle scenes\\, funny anecdotes. But it lacks all the quality things a Star Wars movie posses. Epic storytelling\\, good plot twists\\, and rich character development.\\nHonesty you could skip this movie entirely and watch the 9th and be happy.","true":true}
