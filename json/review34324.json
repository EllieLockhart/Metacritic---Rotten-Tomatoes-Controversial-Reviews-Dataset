Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The action scene were great but seemed thrown together with plot line as if mixed in tumble dryer rather than forming any coherent theme or plot line. Gaping holes were left unlatched & missions were conceived will little thought for relevrelevance & then just ditched as they imploded under the weight of their own futility \/ irrelevance. A deeply frustrating & disappointing follow up to the force awakens & fell way short of the admirable & challenging realism displayed in Rogue One. Bit schmultzy with weak characters given little to do of significance & felt like a rehash if the first three films all squished into one. At least 30 mins too long\\, never thought I'd find myself saying that about a Star Wars film!!!","true":true}
