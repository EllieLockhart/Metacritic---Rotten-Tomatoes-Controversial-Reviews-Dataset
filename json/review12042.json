{"101487":129181,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actively dislike this film. I am a Star Wars fan\\, so it really pains me to be disappointed - I went into this blind\\, donned my Star Wars garb and decided to watch it for the first time on my favourite day so I was really hoping this was going to knock my socks off. Just a month ago I had read that Rian Johnson would be spearheading a new trilogy and people were singing his praises so I thought\\, hell yeah\\, TLJ must be incredible! But ... I can't even say it's mediocre - some parts are good (the music\\, the cinematography) though they don't reach TFA levels (except maybe the CGI?) and some parts are horribly\\, horribly bad.\\n\\nMy grievances will be listed below\\, in descending order of significance. Before I begin\\, let me be clear\\, this is not an argument; I am not trying to persuade you - this is just my personal opinion in the form of a review. My As such\\, the counter-arguments I'm providing aren't meant to lend my beliefs more credence but rather to emphasise the extent to which I cannot with this film. Also\\, MAJOR spoilers follow!\\n\\n1. It feels inconsistent with the rest of the Star Wars franchise\\nTheme one: Heroes and how just one person can make a difference has been a running thread throughout all the movies. Take Obi-wan Kenobi (Leia's last hope)\\, Luke Skywalker (the actual catalyst)\\, Darth Vader (Anakin's change of heart). Now\\, I don't mind subverting this\\, because Star Wars can be fairly unrealistic in terms of unfair odds and a strange fixation on one family. Poe being demoted? Sure\\, that seems like an interesting change for his usurpation of authority; though it can definitely be argued that his actions leading up to that plot point were inconsistent with TFA. Then we get Luke being a cynical grump\\, which is completely expected and fine with me\\, since I think it's a great opportunity to explore grey Jedi (but more on that later). After that\\, we have Finn\\, Poe and Rose's plan - aka the trip to Canto Bright. Oh boy.\\n\\,\\nI understand that not everything goes right for the 'heroes'. I understand that the rebellion is based on dumb luck and pure hope and quite frankly\\, that means everything can and will crumble sometimes. But this felt more like beating a dead horse\\, as if Rian Johnson just wanted to push a message: \\\"This isn't your father's Star Wars(TM)\\\". Already\\, we saw with Poe that listening to authority instead of impulsively rebelling might be the smarter\\, preferred options. So why\\, pray tell\\, must we hammer in the message again by making a good third of the film pointless? The majority of Finn and Rose's arc is rendered meaningless because they - along with Poe - fail pretty spectacularly. At least I can say that I enjoyed their trip and I wouldn't have minded their failure had TLJ been a standalone film\\, one more able to centre around the message of \\\"hey\\, there needs to be some authority and order even within rebellion\\\"\\, I would be super down for that! But considering that this is the second movie in a trilogy\\, it feels irresponsible and selfish for Johnson to focus on this theme. In particular\\, it is indescribably annoying that the foundation of their mess-up was so dumb. It completely undermines the message of \\\"let's listen to authority Sometimes\\\" if said authority could have prevented mutiny and\\, you know\\, been a level-headed\\, pragmatic\\, GOOD figure of authority had she simply said \\\"I have a plan\\\". I realise there was a possibility of a spy on the ship\\, which is what I thought before active tracking was mentioned\\, but once active tracking is established - couldn't Admiral Holdo have said that they would be going somewhere safe? She didn't even need to share the full details (i.e. Crait) with Poe or anyone else\\, but it is ridiculous that basically the entire crew had no clue what was happening. Because\\, let's be real\\, the fact that Poe could organise a mutiny meant that enough people thought Holdo was going to let them die drifting in space. Being a leader means keeping up morale and not leaving your subordinates blind just to follow Leia's thoughts on hope. Yes\\, hope needs to become faith sometimes\\, but not because you're too peeved\/emotional\/??? to prevent hope from faltering. Manufactured faith is so not necessary when you're leading the Rebellion and the fact that this\\, of all things\\, was what led to a bumbled plan just for Johnson to say\\, \\\"Haha\\, heroes can be wrong!\\\" kind of kills me. \\n\\nBesides\\, for all the compliments of originality\\, this theme isn't even all that original considering that rebellion itself is an act against authority (and quite frankly I don't want an Inception \/ forest-style echo chamber of authority-within-authority) and Anakin's various hijinks with Obi-wan; though I suppose\\, oops\\, those aren't canon any more. There are simply more in-character\\, less inefficient ways to make the new trilogy more operatic. Sure\\, Finn's entire character in TFA was based on him disobeying the conditioning of The First Order\\, but I don't think Johnson was justified in going so far with stressing that this doesn't mean that all authority should be repudiated.\\n\\nAfter this\\, we get Finn disobeying Poe and Rose saving him. Honestly\\, I just don't even know what to say about that. I don't think it's nearly as egregious a move as Canto Bright\\, but I do think it sends mixed messages since Rose herself disobeys an order so that she can save her crush's life. Firstly\\, it's a little bit soon for love don't you think? Secondly\\, I have a big problem with how females are treated in this film (but more on that later). Thirdly\\, I am a fan of nuance but mixed messages are inconsistent with Johnson's march against individual acts of heroism.\\n\\nTheme two: Good and evil are pretty starkly differentiated in the originals\\, and the in-between is left out. This was not the case in the EU\\, so I was fairly excited once I read fan theories that TLJ was going to explore the nuances of morality (shout-out to my boy Jacen Solo)\\, probably through grey Jedi. Star Wars has always been a little idealistic and it's a space opera\\, so why not introduce some more drama in the form of darker elements? Seriously\\, though\\, the discussions had me HYPED.\\n\\nWhat we actually got\\, however\\, was an hour of will-he-won't-he with Kylo Ren. Yes\\, yes\\, I know that Johnson says that Kylo is still \\\"redeemable\\\"\\, but he committed parenticide in an attempt to destroy his internal conflict. I think it can be established that Kylo is unlikely to turn to the light side\\, which makes Rey's characterisation pretty astounding. She is blatantly upset at Kylo for killing Han\\, so why does she attack Luke once Kylo has evoked some sympathy? Whether he \\\"create[d] Kylo Ren\\\" does not seem to justify the violence of her behaviour\\, although I suppose that is part of establishing the darkness tugging at her. That doesn't quite explain the emotional rashness that leads her to find Kylo\\, though I suppose that she has reason to lend credence to her visions and desperate people (\\\"he could turn the tide\\\") go to desperate measures.\\n\\nUnlike Rey\\, however\\, the audience is subject to dramatic irony since many people probably think that Kylo will remain a villain. As such\\, this part of the film seems to run on for too long\\, given the lack of effect. I will admit I wasn't as convinced of this as my friend Bonnie\\, and judging from some comments that every twist was surprising\\, my sentiment isn't uncommon. Still\\, the pacing of the film is pretty much destroyed due to the Canto Bright episode being compounded with the force connection between Kylo and Rey. Speaking of\\, why do they have a force connection again? And why is there a shirtless scene to create \\\"uncomfortable intimacy\\\"? No\\, seriously\\, that scene really irritated me for reasons beyond dragging out this farce (but more on that later).\\n\\nOf course\\, all this could be forgiven for the sake of moral nuance\\, because isn't that what Luke being \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is all about? Paving the way for the grey and a new kind of Order\\, one less about black and white morality and more about balance. I love that concept. That is also why I hate Johnson's execution. Kylo is a terrible figurehead for the grey Jedi since he's the new antagonist. Rey isn't so much established as the better way to create grey Jedi but the good counterpart for Kylo (Snoke's speech\\, Luke's training)\\, so Johnson's attempt to create nuance isn't even wholly successful. Plus\\, Kylo's  crusade against the past serves as disconcerting fuel for my perspective of TLJ as Johnson's attempt to discard the old. Though\\, what the heck was that forest? Maybe just a callback to the cave in ESB\\, because that scene and the non-existent worldbuilding made for a very bemused viewing of Rey's mirror world. By the way\\, why the hell did she feel comfortable sharing her insecurities with Kylo\\, who just taunts her the whole movie? But more on that later.\\n\\nSo\\, we don't really explore moral nuances in TLJ\\, because Kylo is an ass and neither Rey nor Luke talk about balance. Kylo didn't give Luke any time to explain and decided to bring the temple down just like that - that isn't moral grey\\, that's just being irrational. Whilst I'm glad Luke's weakness ended up being more in-character than Rey feared\\, I think an opportunity was missed to point out that Luke was perhaps too scared of the darkness. Kylo's internal conflict then ends up being a plot device for Snoke to manipulate Rey\\, since it turns out that Kylo isn't conflicted so much about good and evil but rather disobeying Snoke (I will admit\\, subverting authority for the bad guys and learning to obey for the good guys is a nice move) and starting over. The hesitation before killing Leia is meant to be significant\\, I suppose\\, but in context of the whole movie it peters out and definitely is not enough to carry Johnson's effort to explore the in-between. \\n\\nAs for Rey\\, well\\, she's our only hope for moral nuance now. She clearly struggles between dark and light\\, and whilst Luke was scared of the former\\, I think she can be the 'good' counterpart to Kylo's greyness. She was\\, after all\\, set up to be his complementary opposite throughout the film.  And yet\\, yet! What was her training centred around? Not learning from Luke or how to change up the Jedi order\\, oh no\\, but rather about Kylo Ren (she doesn't even complete her training!). Here Johnson makes a huge error in his handling of the grey Jedi. Rather than Luke passing on his thoughts on the restrictiveness of the Jedi and the importance of balance and humility\\, he gets a few lines about the arrogance of Jedi (and himself). That was decent but simply not enough. Especially not when that time is handed to Kylo for some\\, I don't even know\\, sexual tension (more on that later!). If anyone could have brought nuance to the movie\\, it was Luke. Johnson didn't let him\\, so now it's up to Rey. Still\\, I think Rey could've shown more of the light side because all we get is her vulnerability and loyalty to the Rebellion. It's clear that she feels the draw of the dark side\\, but it's less clear that she also feels the pull of the light. She's driven\\, but is she a hero because she wants to do good (see: Poe\\, Finn) or because she's angry and lost? The whole point of TFA is that heroes can be found in the ordinary\\, so aside from the mess of Rey's parentage\\, why isn't this clearer in TLJ?\\n\\nI think this moral greyness thing can be saved and I dearly hope it will be. I just think Johnson wasted his opportunities (i.e. took the prospect in the wrong direction in TLJ)\\, which simply doesn't work considering that plot-wise TLJ doesn't go very far. This is not okay for the second instalment in a trilogy\\, not to mention what replaces plot (inconsistent messages and a reduction in Star Wars heart)  isn't particularly good either. Now that I think about it\\, that might be why the last 20 minutes are my favourite - something actually happens!\\n\\nTo be honest\\, it felt like Johnson enjoyed contradicting TFA and all that Star Wars (the originals + prequels) stood for. And considering I'm devoting two hours of the new year to writing this\\, I really can't stand for that. Heck\\, Rogue One felt more like a Star Wars film than TLJ\\, and Rogue One was lauded from being a little bit different. This is concerning for an instalment of the MAIN trilogy.\\n\\nCounters: \\n> Star Wars needs a refresher\\, and Johnson brought some much-needed originality. \\nI think this will remain a fundamental\\, subjective difference in belief. Perhaps you actually enjoy the changes that Johnson made to Star Wars\\, and you don't see them as frustrating or half-baked. Maybe you really don't like the idea of gutsy\\, independent heroism (although I can't help but think that Holdo's stubbornness was a silly move to justify Leia's line of her not caring about being \\\"seen as a hero\\\"). Maybe you think Kylo is the epitome of moral nuance (despite the lack of justifying backstory). Or maybe\\, maybe\\, you disliked and\/or didn't care about the originals. As such\\, these changes all seem to breathe new life into Star Wars.\\n\\nI will agree that some of Johnson's changes were refreshing\\, and it's more original than the established structure of the original trilogy. But this is not some artistic endeavour that Johnson can run wild with. Too much novelty within the Star Wars universe (since the actual originality of his ideas is debatable) for the sake of subverting expectations feels too much like pandering to one's ego.\\n\\nBut I completely accept that a change of Star Wars heart is what some people want\\, and I have no interest in changing that.\\n\\nAs for the people who think my problem is with Luke's character (http:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\/us\/movies\/star-wars\/269725\/star-wars-the-last-jedi-do-critics-and-fans-want-different-things) - I do think Hamill\\, bless him\\, is right in that Luke is wildly different from where we left off. I don't think his development is unrealistic\\, and I'm totally cool with how he's portrayed in TLJ\\, but the originality pushed onto Johnson's decisions re: Luke ignore the actual problematic shifts in tone that happen with the main cast.\\n\\nI do agree\\, though\\, that there's something missing in Luke's development which could have been solved had Johnson been more constructive about moral complexity (https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2017\/12\/geeks-guide-last-jedi\/) and no\\, the artistry of Rey's mirror scene doesn't make up for the lack of actual content. Like I keep saying\\, this isn't some standalone Rian Johnson film! I don't think J.J. Abrams only loves film\\, he loves the Star Wars universe\\, as do the fans.\\n\\n> Kylo actually IS morally conflicted and him remaining a villain is to show that people can be morally grey but still end up being bad.\\nTo be honest\\, I like this interpretation\\, especially since Kylo struggling to turn from the dark side but eventually being pretty dark is a decent subversion of expectations. It's also the closest the film comes to moral nuance.\\n\\nOf course\\, that doesn't mean I think the impact that had on pacing was worth it. Which leads me to...\\n\\n2. The pacing and its consequences on Episode IX really worry me.\\nBasically nothing happens in this film. In fact\\, LESS than nothing (I know that doesn't really make sense\\, sorry) happens\\, because the Rebellion is set back and the acts of our protagonists are mostly negated. I don't have a problem with the former because hope in the face of despair is a huge thing for Star Wars. I do\\, however\\, have problems with the latter causing problems for IX. Let's recap:\\n\\nFinn and Rose - Their entire journey to Canto Bright is useless. Literally. There was no point to them going\\, and hence little point to showing the audience SO MUCH of it. Plot advancement: 0\/10. Time consumption: 6\/10.\\n\\nRey and Luke - Mostly useless\\, since Rey doesn't learn much from Luke. She just gets a lot of weird scenes with Kylo. Now\\, this DOES end up bringing Snoke's death\\, so it's more justified than Canto Bright\\, but still\\, there was so much possibility for actual content and plot development (e.g. setting up the grey Jedi!) that just didn't happen. ... Plot advancement: 7\/10. Time consumption: 4\/10.\\n\\nSo you see\\, a good chunk of this film is devoted to not moving the plot forwards. The ending leaves me thinking\\, quite frankly\\, that there is no way that IX can pull off a satisfying ending. I don't want to underestimate J.J. Abrams or the power of individual heroism\\, but I almost think that another film will be needed.\\n\\nEither that\\, or Kylo actually WILL turn to the light side of grey. I don't know\\, I honestly can't with the pacing.\\n\\nP.S. - The time frame of the film is also pretty weird. I mean\\, drawing out scenes for the sake of plot (e.g. the execution\\, the duel between Luke and Kylo) is very much a done thing\\, but the editing is a bit iffy at times.\\n\\nSpeaking of\\, I have another minor complaint about the editing. Whilst they are a callback to the original trilogy\\, the dated transitions feel overused.\\n\\nCounters: \\n>Pacing isn't that important considering we are left with a workable ending.\\nI mean\\, I don't know how workable you can really call the ending\\, but I guess it's a point one can build upon. Personally I'm fond of endings\\, which is why TLJ isn't getting 2.5 stars\\, but I still don't think this justifies the poor pacing.\\n\\n>The pacing is justified by character development\\nUm\\, you mean Finn being relegated to ineffectual comic relief (what is that water suit scene) despite being told before TFA that he would be starring as a hero? Or Rey being used to push 'development' for Kylo\\, even though the nuances of Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo are mainly due to Adam Driver's excellent acting? Or the plot hole of Luke leaving maps to his chosen graveyard???\\n\\nMoving on to a related point...\\n\\n3. How females were treated in this film saddens me\\, especially since people seem to consider it as a feminist masterpiece. Here's the rundown:\\n\\nRose - I like her! She's modest yet spunky\\, with the courage and determination that characterises a true rebel. I also think her burgeoning romance with Finn is cute. But it seems a little silly for her to be so infatuated with Finn\\, so quickly\\, that she literally risks her life to save him. Is this really the feminist message we should be pushing?\\n\\nRey - She isn't very empowered by Luke's training or her experience with the two sides of the Force. Instead\\, she is manipulated by Snoke and used to further the character of Kylo Ren. The latter is especially painful considering the really weird sexual tension between them. Why? Why??? He is quite a bit older canonically\\, not to mention he killed a father figure of hers (Han) and gaslit her. Having briefly encountered gaslighting myself\\, I have to say\\, it is fucking unhealthy. \\\"You are nothing - but not to me\\\". Run FAR\\, FAR away from anyone who says that.\\n\\nThen at the end\\, it's implied that there might be a love triangle between Poe\\, Rose and her. I would really much prefer that Rey isn't canonically involved with anyone in this trilogy\\, to be honest. Or hell\\, even hook her up with Finn if Poe isn't going to get in on that action. But I'd rather Rey just be a badass force-user right now.\\n\\nHoldo: Although she isn't particularly significant\\, I do like that she is shown to be a strong\\, courageous\\, dignified admiral. I also love the opportunity to show a female friendship between her and Leia. \\n\\nStill\\, it's odd that she is so childishly dismissive of Poe\\, resulting in her being a pretty poor authority figure when it matters (aka the Canto Bright incident).\\n\\nPhasma: We were told that she would have a bigger role in the sequels\\, so unless she comes back in IX (which I can't say I even want at this point)\\, this is just a huge waste of Brienne of Tarth. Plus\\, you can't just subvert audience expectations for the sake of doing so\\, especially when it comes to giving a female a bigger role. I mean\\, a female badass high up in The First Order? Let's do it!\\n\\nOr\\, you know\\, not. I guess\\, if you're Johnson.\\n\\nNot only that\\, but minorities are also given the short shaft. That might be an unpopular opinion considering that on paper\\, TLJ is as diverse as Star Wars has ever been - plus the bad guys look almost all white. However\\, Finn is shown not to learn from previous mistakes re: authority and is basically demoted to comic relief (e.g. being starry-eyed about the casino); Poe is somewhat out-of-character just to give the story some drama (not even narrative fuel\\, though); Rose becomes a love interest in a potential love triangle near the end.\\n\\nCounters:\\n> Rose is IN LOVE and the message is about love\\, not girls being infatuated!\\nI think love at first sight\\, or puppy love motivating rash actions\\, is equally dangerous. We have mildly sexist Hollywood rom-coms and Romeo & Juliet to show us all that. We don't need Star Wars to do the same. Unfortunately\\, Johnson seems to think otherwise\\, since in a deleted scene he has Rose being jealous and chastising Finn for \\\"pining for Rey\\\" (http:\/\/www.radiotimes.com\/news\/film\/2017-12-21\/star-wars-the-last-jedi-has-a-lot-of-deleted-scenes-that-well-be-able-to-see-soon\/). Catty girl drama is the last thing we\\, and the Star Wars universe\\, needs right now.\\n\\nAnd yes\\, I think Han and Leia was a bit rushed too. Fortunately\\, Leia didn't need to do something extra stupid for Han to demonstrate her love.\\n\\n> You're reading too much into the editing of Rey's looks at the end\\nI would be SO glad if this were the case\\, you have no idea. I hate love triangles. So much!\\nThing is\\, Finn and Rey's friendship is stressed by both of them. The potential for romance is teased by the audience not being able to know what Chewie conveys on behalf of Rey. That\\, and quick cuts to character's expressions are used to show something. Considering we cut to Rey's face (even smiling) right after Finn covers Rose with a blanket... Sigh. I hope it just means she's a supportive friend. \\n\\n> The movie retains the anti-Nazi undertones of the originals. What are you even talking about?\\nYeah\\, I do think the minority representation thing is a bit of a stretch. I'm pissed about Finn's role in TLJ\\, but hopefully that'll be made up for in IX.\\n\\n> Rose isn't relegated to a love interest!\\nOkay\\, yeah\\, it doesn't help that she's unconscious at the ending. And I DO like her character and her badass moments. Plus\\, there are plenty of girl power moments (Rey against Snoke + Kylo\\, Leia always\\, Holdo's sacrifice\\, Rose's sister). I just don't think it's as feminist as it's made out to be\\, although it IS more feminist than Star Wars has been previously.\\n\\n4. Forced\\, flat humour tends to be the comedy style of TLJ. The MCU has some fantastic humour despite its more serious films. I'm okay with that\\, because I know that's what I'm in for going in. I also appreciated the humour in TFA\\, and some of it in TLJ. But it simply wasn't as funny as I expected - and that wasn't for lack of trying on Johnson's side...\\n\\nWhy did Luke throw away his lightsaber??? This really seemed to contradict the spirit of TFA's ending. I get it\\, it subverts audience expectations\\, but it also contradicts Luke's character and as such is too uncomfortable for me to laugh at.\\n\\nI really liked the opening sequence with Poe and General \\\"Hugs\\\"\\, but I can understand if it dragged on too long for some.\\n\\nI did not like Finn walking around the water suit\\, especially since Johnson reduced Finn's role so much. It just seems like Johnson didn't really like Finn\\, which is unfortunate for minority representation.\\n\\nThe porgs are super cute and I do think the exchange between Chewie and the porgs is funny.\\n\\nThe rampage of the casino is questionable.\\n\\nLeia shooting Finn is funny\\, but also dubiously trigger-happy.\\n\\nYoda is a little meh\\, but his lightning trick is amusing.\\n\\nRey lifting rocks got a genuine laugh out of me!\\n\\nOverall\\, I don't think the jokes fully landed. It's not like they weren't entertaining\\, but in the context of the film\\, they didn't always mesh with the atmosphere (unlike Guardians of the Galaxy\\, Deadpool or Batman). I mean\\, TLJ is funny but not nearly enough for me to think about describing it as such.\\n\\nCounters:\\n> I thought it was funny.\\nYeah\\, I mean\\, humour is super subjective. It probably worked really well for some\\, and I'm glad!\\n\\n5. Some assorted points \\n\\n> Leia using the Force to get back to the ship was so unintentionally funny. I mean\\, I would have been okay if she'd died outside (I don't care too much about epic deaths I guess). I'm glad she didn't\\, but also\\, what even was that return?\\n\\n> John Williams remains brilliant\\, but even the soundtrack isn't as good in TLJ\\n\\n> Why is General Hux so snivelling here?\\n\\n> I don't mind Snoke's sudden death as a subversion\\, but the ONLY recourse I can see now for the dashing of expectations is that we all unanimously forget about him. His name is never mentioned again and we absolutely do not hear anything about his backstory in IX.\\n\\n> Why is Rey so skilled in the Force if she's just the daughter of nobody? I think it's viable that Kylo was purely manipulating her with that\\, though I'm coming to terms with her being a nobody. \\n\\nI was very fond of the idea that she was a Skywalker\\, though. Star Wars to me SHOULD star some main bloodlines because that's what started it all. There's nothing wrong with new blood\\, but you don't have to kill off the old. Especially since Rey hasn't received enough training for her to harness that non-inherited power like she has in TLJ. I was also hoping she could be a Solo\\, just because I miss Jaina like hell and the parallels are there (hotheaded\\, good with swinging a sabre\\, [potential] romance with a pilot). So yeah\\, I'm a tad sad about my pet theories.\\n\\nOverall...\\nIn a way\\, you can paint my thoughts simply as \\\"it went against fan expectations\\\". That is not\\, in itself\\, a good criticism however. What fans expect are not inherently inferior to what critics want. In fact\\, I would argue\\, for a film alleging to be part of an established franchise - we die-hard fans matter a lot. You absolutely cannot take TLJ\\, or any of the episodes\\, out of the context of Star Wars ... And this felt like a misguided struggle to break away. That\\, to me\\, is unfair both to the movie crew (who I'm sure worked extremely hard - the cast\\, in particular\\, did a brilliant job) and the audience. It's also sad when fan theories about the plot (e.g. grey Jedi) end up being more fleshed-out than the actual movie.\\n\\nAll I can say is that I now have to have faith that J.J. Abrams will somehow turn things around. Since he did direct TFA\\, at least the feel should be more consistent\\, though I have no idea how the plot is going to be wrapped up. Godspeed\\, rebels.\\n\\nTL;DR - this comment is a fairly accurate description of how I feel: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StarWars\/comments\/7kd6st\/spoilers_what_people_actually_disliked_about_the\/drdq127\/?context=3","true":true}
