Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hope that Disney and Rian Johnson are looking at these Audience reviews. The negative comments\\, for me\\, are spot on. \\n\\n50% of the Audience - most of the true star wars fans probably - liked it. This is a HUGE failing for Disney and Johnson.\\n\\nThe film seems to lack a fundamental misunderstanding of the Star Wars culture I grew up with in the 70s and 80s. \\n\\nThey ruined - completely - Luke Skywalker and I don't think I need to go into all the other failings. \\n\\nThey took the only Jedi left\\, and turned him from a hero into coward. Everything we knew about him was gone in a few lines of rushed dialogue and poorly treated comedy. \\n\\nSince when was Star Wars a comedy?\\n\\nUtterly appalling treatment of Luke's character. \\n\\nAnd why did he die? So the rebels could sneak out of the back door?\\n\\nSERIOUSLY?\\n\\nKilo Ren is now the supreme leader\\, Rey doesn't have anyone to train her\\, (although I am sure Luke will be back as a force-type ghost.  The rebels seem to have lost everything and Luke turned up to tell Leia that he wasn't there to save her son and then didn't actually do anything to Kilo. \\n\\nIN FACT - we waited 30 years for Luke to return and basically die in order to let the rebels slip out of the back door. \\n\\nTHAT is the sum total of Luke's effectiveness. \\n\\nPiss poor.","true":true}
