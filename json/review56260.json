Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, is the most different Star Wars movie of the whole saga\\, and the most beautiful one. The film leaves us with some unanswered questions that The Force Awakens made to us\\, like \\\"Who's Snoke after all?\\\"\\, \\\"How did Maz got Luke's Lightsaber?\\\"\\, and some others. But\\, it also answers a feel questions\\, but... not all of them are in the way that we expected. It really should be called \\\"Star Wars: Twist\\\"\\, because is the most thing that happen in the movie: Plot Twists. And there are so many that it gave me headache. The lights\\, the space battles\\, the visual effects and the use of colors are astonishing\\, but there are some unnecessary \\\"arcs\\\" of story\\, like Finn and Rose's\\, that is kind of boring\\, although it gives us debates of light and darkness. This movie is really different because it shows us a lot of messages\\, that no other Star Wars movie has ever shown us\\, like debates about:\\n - The Force can be born in every person\\n - There's no good and evil\\n - The past lies in the past\\n - Focus on what's happening now\\n - Lots of other things\\nBut there are issues. And a lot of them.\\nThose debates\\, serve only to explain some things\\, but it really shouldn't had occupied a lot of the movie\\, because I felt that some story arcs where made only to show to us debates on themes\\, that could've been shown on other movies of the Star Wars universe. This movie had A LOT of potential\\, that wasn't used (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD).\\n\\nNeither Luke or Snoke or Captain Phasma had to die in this movie\\, and one of the debates of this movie is forget the past and move on\\, but it's with the past and its failures that we can learn and build a good future for everyone.\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\\, is a beautiful\\, exciting\\, and emotional movie\\, but it doesn't take advantage of the potential it had\\, and let's a \\\"What now?\\\"\\, on everyone's face\\, anything can happen on Star Wars: Episode IX\\, and I'm personally looking forward to it.","true":true}
