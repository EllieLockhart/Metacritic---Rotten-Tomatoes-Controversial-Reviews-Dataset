Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film\\, just as its predecessor\\, continues to demonstrate that Disney does not understand what makes Star Wars one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.\\n\\nDisney has admitted that they did not write an overarching story for these new films. Apparently\\, the directors are making it up as they go. Well let me tell you\\, it really shows. From the poor writing\\, to the cringe worthy humor\\, to the overt political messages being shoved down the audience throat\\, to the lack of basic character development\\, to the numerous plot holes\/contrivances\\, or just the general lack of emotion\/feeling in the story\\, this film not only fails as a Star Wars film\\, but as a film in general.\\n\\nHow this film\/script was ever greenlit is beyond me. Disney should legitimately hold off on releasing any more SW's content until some major changes happen within the company. They need people in charge who understand SW and who are passionate about it. Additionally\\, Disney needs to get the boardroom influence out of the creative process. Let the director\\, writers\\, and other contributors to these films breathe and create art (These films will print money regardless; all that the corporate influence is doing is destroying the brand and driving away fans).\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is the worst SW movie by a landslide. I would rather sit in a room and watch the prequels on repeat than watch this horrendous film ever again.","true":true}
