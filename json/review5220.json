Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Decent film with some major issues. Character assassination of Luke Skywalker\\, Kylo Ren continues to be a whiny bitch\\, Rey is a full-blown Mary Sue seeing as her parents were nobodies and she's received no training but can best Luke Skywalker in a fight\\, etc.","true":true}
