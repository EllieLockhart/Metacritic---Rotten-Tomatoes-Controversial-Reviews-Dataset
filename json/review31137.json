Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many bad choices made by Rian Johnson\\, JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy on this movie. These are experienced film makers. Ok it has to be different but not so radically changed that it spoils what went before. The Anakin lightsaber tossed over the shoulder sums up the whole movie. Surely at Lucasfilm (The biggest Star Wars fans you can imagine)\\, someone could have stood up and said \\\"hang on a minute\\\" It has soured Christmas.","true":true}
