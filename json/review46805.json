Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well it was a good movie and I saw that alt-right dumbasses are disliking it for no good reason. I enjoyed most of the movie except for a few corny parts or how it seemed that there were way more than 10\/13 of the planes that were destroyed in that salt planet scene.","true":true}
