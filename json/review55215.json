Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a slap in the face... over and over again. Almost every story question\\, curiosity\\, or interesting character was just reduced to an insulting two and a half hour middle finger. \\n\\nI don't know what movie the critics were watching... \\n\\nI will list only a few of the many problems I have with this movie. SPOILERS AHEAD:\\n\\n1) Leia just randomly having force powers\\, being able to survive the vacuum of space\\, and just pulling herself back into the ship. No. No\\, no\\, no\\, no\\, no. This just seems like a writer that was too uneducated to know which Skywalker had training in the force\\, and then just rolled with it. It wasn't awe-inspiring. It wasn't creative. It wasn't a \\\"risk\\\". It was just bad. \\n\\n2) Rey is now a character that many\\, including myself\\, just do not care about anymore\\, or at the very least find less interesting. WHY would you make her a nobody? The entire Star Wars story (movies) has been based around the Skywalker family. You have other powerful force-sensitive families that she could have come from. You have characters from games\/novelizations... ANYTHING! But now we have no background... no interesting lineage... just this random person that is now able to compete with a Skywalker. \\n\\n3) The comedy. Why are you trying to make Star Wars into some Marvel-esque superhero comedy? You set this film up to be a battle of light and darkness. The stage was set for battle\\, tension\\, intrigue\\, and war. Instead... we got forced\\, out of place comedy\\, random shirtless Kylo Ren\\, and some awkward milking scene... \\n\\n4) I have no desire to see the next episode. And I don't mean this in a \\\"I'm boycotting the franchise because my fan theory didn't come true\\\" way. What I mean is\\, this is the first time in the entirety of my love of Star Wars that I have no desire to see the next film\\, because every character progression or fate that I would normally care about\\, I just don't. That care\\, that wonder\\, that curiosity... it is just gone. I have no interest to see where these characters go\\, because to me they are insultingly ruined through poor writing\\, and destructive regression. That is how badly the writer\/director has mutilated this film. \\n\\nI hope that this film hits Disney where it hurts\\, their bank accounts. Of course\\, it is Star Wars\\, people will want to see it. But\\, I have already started warning friends to just wait to see it when it becomes free to stream from a service like Amazon Prime. Paying to see this trash is the only further insult that can be done to many Star Wars fans. \\n\\nA disappointment\\, to be sure.","true":true}
