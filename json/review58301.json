Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. Nothing makes sense when you think about it. Every plot thread is connected and it boggles the mind how literally every action either doesn't matter or was nonsensical. If the characters acted like rational human beings at any point in the film\\, the (already weak) plot would have fallen apart\\, The character of Luke is taken in an entirely different direction from the original trilogy\\, for the sake of being edgy and subverting expectations. \\n\\nBy the end of the film\\, basically everything is the same. The rebels are on the run from the first order\\, low on recourses -- and at the end of the film\\, you guessed it. The rebels are on the run from the first order.\\n\\nAn entire new plot device was introduced to the 40 year old lore of this franchise - the first order can track ships through light speed\\, which makes me wonder how they could possibly be the victors of this trilogy at the end of episode IX.\\n\\nAbsolutely terrible movie\\, I've hardly scratched the surface of the plot holes and nonsensical character decisions. Save your money on this one.","true":true}
