Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well you can tell Disney has firm control of the franchise. It\u2019s essentially a 3 hour Jar Jar Binks movie. It is made for kids and not the lovers of the original trilogy. It once again try\u2019s to \u201csteal\u201d from the originals and the story line is predictable. The best thing to come from it is I am not anxious with anticipation for the next one to come out. ","true":true}
