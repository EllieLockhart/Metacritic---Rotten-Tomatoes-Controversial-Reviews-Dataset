Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last jedi is a horrible movie that ruin the star wars saga don't be fooled by the critics the movie is a nightmare for star wars fans and no spoilers but if you had a theory there is 99.99% that its wrong","true":true}
