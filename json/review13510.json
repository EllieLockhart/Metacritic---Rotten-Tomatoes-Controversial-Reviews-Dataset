Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel enough time has passed I can post a review without spoiling it. Simply... there are issues here. The tone is off\\, trying to combine Marvel esque comedy with a dark atmosphere to rival\\, and perhaps surpass\\, Empire Strikes Back. Add in an hour long sidequest\\, with trivial characters (one of whom should've died at the end of the previous installment)\\, and a script that struggles to work at best\\, and its clear to see why this has such poor audience ratings. That being said\\, this is by far the pretties Star Wars film\\, and an obligatory film to see if you want to stay up to date on pop culture. I only fell asleep in it once...","true":true}
