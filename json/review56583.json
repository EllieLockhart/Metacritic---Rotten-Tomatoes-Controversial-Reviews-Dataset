Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a rehash of Empire Strikes Back which starts where it ends\\, going absolutely nowhere.  The film offers up heaping helpings of nostalgia\\, like a super group from the Seventies that have become parodies of them \\nselves.  Disney of course is trying to please the prequelle \\n\\ngeneration and in comparison\\, the Last Jedi soars.  But\\, that does not make Jedi a good movie.  My Thirteen year old son\\, who Disney is trying to sell on the franchise\\, thoughts the movie was just so so and pointed out the many plot holes.   Regardless\\, as long as the Franchise continues to sell tickets and the critics on Disney's pay roll\\, continue to hype what gets churned out.\\, we'll continue to get films that don't stray too far from the recipe.  But each and every one will fail to capture the magic of the first and second films.  And that's a shame.","true":true}
