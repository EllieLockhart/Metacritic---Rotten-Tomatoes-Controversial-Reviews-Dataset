Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They assumed that there was no previous universe of lore. This film would have been ok ok it's own but they build up so much in the force awakens and then killed it all in this film. There was so much forced comedy that was unneeded and unwanted for most every person. I just am so bitter about wasting 3 hours of my life and 25$.","true":true}
