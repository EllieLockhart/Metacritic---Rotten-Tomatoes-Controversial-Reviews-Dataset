Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete disappointment. The villains lacked any build up or story -- there is zero emotional investment here. Kylo continues his angsty emo rageaholic tendencies. Fun if you're looking to see the entire SW spirit thrown away for something 'new' coming in Episode 9. Otherwise\\, a hefty pass for me.","true":true}
