Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot was weak. The comedy made it feel as though it were Guardians of the Galaxy\\, and it doesn\u2019t build in characters from the first film. The movie was extremely slow and seemed to have the \u201cDisney Effect\u201d of taking any serious moment an injecting comedy when it didn\u2019t need to be there. The best scenes were the visually stunning scenes that were not funny. Disappointing. ","true":true}
