Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"MY GOODNESS! Sorry Star Wars Fans but this one is bad bad bad. Its all over the place\\, with no real plot\\, and no questions are answered. The Last Jedi? WHAT Luke is a Jedi RIGHT? In 2 1\/2 hours who did Luke \\\"JEDI\\\" Rey? Kylo? NO NO NO!! Garbage movie Don't waste your Money!!!","true":true}
