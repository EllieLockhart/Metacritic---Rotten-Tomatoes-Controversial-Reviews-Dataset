Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reviews that are like \\\"you'll hate it you're a REAL fan\\\" are crap. Don't put your stuff on me\\, folks. I'm a real fan and I thought it was great.\\n\\nIt's definitely different than previous Star Wars movies. It's darker\\, twist-ier\\, and much more happens. I'm going to have to go see it again just to catch all of the stuff that I'm sure I missed the first time (rather than just seeing it again because of the reason I usually do\\, which is that I see every movie at least a few times to make sure they get enough of my money to keep making Star Wars movies).\\n\\nI like that the characters were more complex than \\\"Luke is good and Anakin   is bad\\\" stuff. To me\\, Kylo Ren is a more nuanced character than Anakin ever was... in either trilogy. I liked that the story took unexpected turns. I liked the call-outs to fans. I liked the humour. I love Rey\\, Finn\\, Leia\\, and now Rose. I liked the storyline with Poe and Vice Admiral Holdo. I liked that Snoke was not what anybody expected. I liked what they did with Luke\\, and thought they whole treatment was very fitting and believable.\\n\\nI want my Star Wars story to grow\\, and this did it for me in the way that none of the other movies have. \\n\\nIf you are a Star Wars fan LIKE ME\\, you'll like it.","true":true}
