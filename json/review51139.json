Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible! Legitimately one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Rian and Kathleen completely obliterate star wars. R.I.P. (I'm not rating 1\/2 star because then it's not counted in the Audience total score which is the only reason why it's at 46% and not much\\, much lower).","true":true}
