Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed.  The movie felt as a total disservice to Star Wars fans.  What they did to Luke in my opinion is insulting.  All of the interesting plot points that were brought up in the Force Awakens are thrown away here.  There is a scene with Leia that I could not help but laugh at.  The characters are uninteresting\\, and I couldn't care less about them.  The only things I can say positively are the visuals (which are great!)\\, and Mark Hamill gave it his all.  But overall\\, this movie was an insult to what I liked about Star Wars.  I lost all interest in seeing any Star Wars movies after this.","true":true}
