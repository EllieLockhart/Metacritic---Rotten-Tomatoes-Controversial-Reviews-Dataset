Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ill conceived and poorly executed\\, The Last Jedi is the most ridiculous movie since Battlefield Earth and the greatest franchise killer since Batman & Robin. Utterly mystified as to how this movie was released and think Rian Johnson needs to ask Santa Claus for a screenwriting book next Christmas or ask Kathleen Kennedy to send him to a McKee seminar or something because this film is so poorly written\\, one could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a parody.  As a female\\, I find nothing even remotely interesting or \\\"empowering\\\" about Rey and consider her to be nothing more than a Disney Princess. Strong female characters have arcs.  Think of Ellen Ripley and Sarah Conner -  Both incredible creations and amazing characters. Now think of Rey... Pretty underwhelming isn't it?","true":true}
