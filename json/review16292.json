Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im not old enough to be a diehard fan. I enjoyed watching the original series\\,  and even the last 5. I went to watch regardless of the bad reviews but i wish i didnt. Can't get that time back. Its very painful to watch\\, story was stale\\, choppy\\,  and full of plotholes. It didnt help that it was leftist propaganda\\, but i can normally ignore that if the movie is good. I cant believe the professional reviewers have this at 9 stars. They MUST have been paid for their favorable reviews.","true":true}
