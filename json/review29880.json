Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rose is pointless right up to the point when she dooms the Rebellion.\\nFinn could've been far more useful if he was with Poe.\\nAdmiral Gender Studies is the biggest idiot ever! TELL THEM YOUR PLAN\\, DUMMY!\\nWHY REVIVE LEIA? Her death was beautifully tragic and logical with the real-life death of Carrie Fisher. Now you have to kill her off off-screen!!! Why did you turn her into Space Jesus\\, flying through space to just go into coma and then hang around just to justify the pink-haired moron's status as \\\"a good guy\\\". You can destroy the mega ship chasing you? CRASH ONE SHIP INTO IT BEFORE HAVING ALL THE REST TRASHED\\, MORON!\\n\\nI hate this movie! Hate it!","true":true}
