Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most disappointing movie-going experience of my life. I cannot imagine what movie the critics were watching when they gave this such a high positive score. It was worse than Attack of the Clones. The \u201chumor\u201d was for eight year olds. Leia can fly through space? Luke likes alien milk? Snoke is gone like he was nothing? Luke is gone like he was nothing? This was a total pile of horse crap and everyone involved should be embarrassed. ","true":true}
