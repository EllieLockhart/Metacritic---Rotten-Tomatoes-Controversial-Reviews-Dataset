Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I tried so hard to like this movie but when the lighting on the floor of the cinema becomes of more interest\\, you have to begin to wonder.  A good judge of any of the latest Disney run of Star Wars movies beyond the usual artistic standards is\\, if it was not a Star Wars movie\\, how would you score it\\, and unfortunately using that criteria the most I can do is 3 stars.\\nLook\\, it's not as awful as some may have you believe and I think maybe that's a reflection of their disappointment at this complete wasted opportunity and also what some may feel\\, as I certainly do\\, has been done with possibly one of the most loved movie characters in the history of cinema and maybe more importantly his anticipated return to the screen at this point in his life. I'll leave you to see for yourself and judge that one but all in all\\, the movie is a joining of segments of some good ideas and some utterly abysmal ones.  Most that lead nowhere with little character progression or purpose\\, and others that take you on a journey of the promise of cinema riches to leave you abandoned on the side of highway thumbing a ride to the next movie of promise. Comedy moments are thrown in with little care for placement\\, timing\\, or context\\, almost always falling flat.  Action sequences are almost always teasing at what they could have been\\, where any moments of tenderness and consequence are poorly and predictably scripted and so often acted as though it is a read through in pre-production.  I truly came away feeling two things.  That my Sunday morning had been wasted\\, and that the opportunity to escalate an incredible franchise to cult status for a new generation had been missed entirely and even worse\\, sabotaged for whomever gets the gig next.","true":true}
