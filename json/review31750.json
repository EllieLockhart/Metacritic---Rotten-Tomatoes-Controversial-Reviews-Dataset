Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, this Is how a franchise dies...With thunderous reviews. All of the visuals of a Star Wars movie but none of the heart. Pointless sub-plots\\, Weak premise. No hero's tale. No struggle to find one's self. I loved  \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and \\\"Rogue One\\\". But what they did in this installment makes one believe there is no hope for the 3rd installment\\,","true":true}
