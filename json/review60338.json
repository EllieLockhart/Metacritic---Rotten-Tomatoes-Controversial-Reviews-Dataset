We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let\u2019s start with the positives. This game is a technical marvel. Amazing graphics and environments that aren\u2019t likely to be topped until a couple years into the next console generation. The accessibility options are also really incredible. Hopefully other developers can take notice and implement similar options in their games to making gaming more accessible for people that weren\u2019t able to enjoy it before.Gameplay\\, I\u2019m a bit lukewarm on. It really hasn\u2019t changed much from the first game. To me it was serviceable in the first game\\, because it was a vehicle to get you through a really awesome story. This probably won\u2019t win you over if you really hated the first game from a gameplays perspective.Now onto the story. Full disclosure\\, I heard about the leaks in advance\\, but was optimistic that context could make them more understandable. Some of the biggest plot points in fictional history would have seemed totally crazy if you heard about them without context. Unfortunately\\, at least in my opinion\\, context did not make things better.ND seemed to be set from the start on Joel dying and the game ending a certain way\\, but apparently couldn\u2019t be bothered with putting much thought into how to get there. Somehow Joel\u2019s 30 years of survival instincts eroded away in 4 short years\\, and put him in a situation he could have never possibly ended up in.Now the ending\\, throughout the game they really emphasize how far Ellie is willing to go for revenge with heinous act after heinous act\\, to finally back down at the finish line\\, a final action that can\u2019t even compare to killing dogs and pregnant women. It\u2019s just really really poor writing\\, and really doesn\u2019t seem like it could have possibly come from the same creative minds that brought us the original.In the end I think a 6\/10 is pretty reasonable\\, because the game does achieve some pretty spectacular things\\, but stumbled hard at the one thing fans really wanted ND to deliver on.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
