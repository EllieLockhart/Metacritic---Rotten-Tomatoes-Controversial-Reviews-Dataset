Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's Meh. It's not a bad movie by any means. Its great. It's just not a great star wars film. There's a certain lack of character development that was apparent in this and TFA compared to the original trilogy and even the prequels.\\n\\nThere are a lot of scenes that seem skimmed over\\,  rushed and lazy.\\n\\nIt's a movie where I think they should have focused less on cool fight scenes and more on character development with Rey and Luke and everyone. We are 2 movies into the new sequels and I feel like the directors don't even know which actor plays who at this point.","true":true}
