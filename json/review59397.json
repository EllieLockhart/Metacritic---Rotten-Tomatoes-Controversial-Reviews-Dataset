Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"A lot has been said about this game. The only thing I can do after beating it is agreeing with the fact that it\u2019s bad. Gameplay is fine but identical to the first one. The feeling is that the game drags itself so much over its welcome\\, due to decent but highly repetitive mechanics and level design. The first one had on its side a shorter length\\, and a much\\, much better storyline and characters. This part 2 goes in every single wrong direction it could\\, when it comes to these two aspects. It starts flushing away the most fundamental thing that EVERYONE wanted to see: the relationship between Joel and Ellie\\, killing off the first\\, and transforming the second into an unlikable sociopathic dumbass. All the other characters are either destroyed and marginalized (Tommy) or just forgettable in the best case\\, including Abby. I\u2019ve seen many hating her so much. I couldn\u2019t do even that. She just doesn\u2019t make me feel anything. She\u2019s so bi-dimensional that DoomGuy expresses infinite more personality with a couple of grunts. What made me feel extremely annoyed though is the way the writers try to trick the player in liking her with any sort of subterfuge\\, because oooh she plays with doggos\\, oooh look how she saves zebras\\, oooh look how she saves kids\\, oooh look how many friends she has\\, she must be the best person in the world. Well no\\, she is not. She is just a terribly written character (together with all her besties)\\, with 0 character development and an atrociously boring and stupid storyline that goes nowhere and simply wastes your time. Even the LGBT representation is done much better in the first game (Bill and his side story are so well written\\, so sweet and at the same time so bitter. Definitely one of the best parts of the first game). Here things are just thrown in just for sake of politics\\, decontextualized\\, stereotyped and simply uninteresting. What I wanted to see in the game are Ellie and Joel\\, how they\u2019re coping with the end of civilization (the best part of this whole thing is the flashback in the museum)\\, I wanted to see developments with the infection\\, I wanted to see how humanity is surviving. I wanted lore\\, emotions\\, world building\\, character development. What I\u2019ve got instead is Abby literally taking it in the ass in one of the worse sex scenes I\u2019ve ever watched.Giving it a 5 because of the graphics. Seriously\\, I can\u2019t understand how were they able to achieve this on an obsolete hardware such as PS4. This is going to be the benchmark for the new console generation\\, together with RDR2 and Death Stranding. And\\, hopefully\\, Cyberpunk 2077.Please CDProjekt\\, don\u2019t disappoint us.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
