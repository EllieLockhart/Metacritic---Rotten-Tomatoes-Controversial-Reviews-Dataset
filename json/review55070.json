Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen this movie twice and loves it as much the second time as I did the first. I\\, like millions of people have been a fan of these films my entire life. Fell in love with the thrill and excitement\\, the heart and love\\, the scharacters\\, the storyline. These movies have a point to them. A deeper meaning. I love it. The originals came out over 40 years ago. That means it left fans 40+ years to imagine what happened to Luke\\, Leia\\, and Han after Jedi. This movie is different and completely unexpected and that is ok. Yeah sure there were some weird force tricks that they added but remember all Star Wars films added to the force and the power that it brought. This movie needed to be made to keep Star Wars relevant 40 years later. Open up your mind to the knew generation of actors. Protagonists change from Luke to Rey. Antagonists change from Vador to kylo. Everything about this movie is top notch and the fact that it has a Lower ration than attack of the clones is astonishing. The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since Empire.","true":true}
