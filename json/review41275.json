{"101487":184228,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete mess in so many ways\\,  Let's count them shall we: total spoilers of every plot aspect of the movie ahead - be warned ...... Poe starts the movie with a \\\"your mother\\\" joke\\, Hux is humiliated in ever scene he's in\\, bombs can drop in space even though there is no gravity\\, obvious foreshadowing with Paige's necklace\\, The First Order continually make stupid military decisions\\, Poe is directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of resistance fighters but just gets demoted\\, Rose is earnest about EVERYTHING\\, Leia can now fly in space (without a spaceship!)\\, Luke throws his fathers lightsaber over his shoulder after the audience waited two years to see the culmination of this scene\\, Luke lactates a sea cow\\, Luke isn't really Luke - he's so different to the original trilogy he feels like someone else\\, Rey is a Mary Sue in every scene\\, Finn and Rose consult Poe about their cunning plan - Poe's answer is \\\"and then we blow it up\\\" because Poe is now the dumbest character in Star Wars\\, Finn and Rose go on a pointless side quest where they fail\\, but save  bunch of enslved space horses while failing to even try to save the enslaved children that look after them\\, though they do find DJ who is also pointless and betrays them later though it doesn't matter anyway - end of DJ\\, Vice Admiral Purple Hair (I'm sorry Holdo) doesn't tell Poe her plan to save everyone so Poe mutinies (just tell him like any normal human being would)\\, Rey and Kylo space Skype each other and we get to see Kylo's bare torso confirming he works out\\, Luke thought about murdering a sleeping teenager (yes really\\, that actually happened)\\, May Sue Rey bests Luke in a duel even though she's had literally no training and he's a Jedi Master\\, Finn and Rose are captured by Phasmaa because she's alive but hang on Finn calls her Chrome Dome\\, kills her with a \\\"Rebel Scum\\\" quip and he and Rose get rescued by BB8 driving an ATST (yes\\, I know but again this actually happens in the script)\\, Rey drops in on The First Order because ya know Mary Sue can\\, Kylo kills Snoke because why the hell not at this point and let's cap it off by discovering Rey's parents are nobody so take all your theories built up by the producers and fans and flush them down the space toilet\\, the resistance escape to Not-Hoth\\, Purple Hair light speeds through Snokes ship thus rendering all space weapons in the future pointless as they too can be light-speed-destroyed\\,  bunch of pointless almost deaths almost happen on Not-Hoth\\, Rose delivers the second worst dialogue in the franchise's history with some BS about \\\"we win by saving those we love\\\" (Anakin still gets first place with his \\\"sand soliloquies\\\")\\, Luke turns up with a darker beard and has a Not-lightsaber duel with Kylo which ends with the reveal that Luke wasn't really there except he dies anyway so why didn't he just go to Not-Hoth for real\\, but Mary Sue Rey\\, Finn and new leader and everyones favourite mass murdering hothead Poe escape in the Falcon and everyone smiles because they are space happy but not before one of the slave kids Finn and Rose didn't save force grabs a broom and looks up to the stars.  Sigh!  If you think that was a particularly poorly constructed synopsis then trust me when i say it is a masterpiece of grammatical prose compared to the writing in this utter mess.  Rainn Johnson has achieved the impossible: he's turned die hard Star Wars fans into apathetic flight risks from the franchise.  Half a star for the music.  Will not watch again.","true":true}
