Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't see that coming! After 3 showings in the first 3 days\\, I've come to the conclusion this is the best film in the saga so far. Every time I thought I knew where the story was going it took a left turn and suprised me. The cast performances in this film are great and the emotion is real. I give it a full 5 stars.","true":true}
