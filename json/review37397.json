Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this Movie is that they picked up so many story parts but left them unfinished. They only showed really small aprts of Rey and Luke's \\\"training\\\"\\, the whole casino on canto bight didn't felt \\\"Star Wars-like\\\" and there were so many unnecessary slapstick-moments and jokes in it (Poe talking about Hux'es mother). All in all\\, they just wanted too much in one film and lost focus on the storytelling and the character-development.","true":true}
