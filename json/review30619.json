Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply brilliant. In this day and age where the bar for movies have gone down thanks to DC and transformers movies assuming that cg effects can replace his story telling\\, stories\\, acting and movie making\\, I was astonished to enjoy this one so much. The force awakens and rogue I've were pretty good but not at this level of enjoyment. I've enjoyed almost every single marvel universe movie made but this exceeded even those. Of course I am a longtime hardcore star wars fan so I'm biased. However you could also argue that I'm a harsher critic for that reason too.  Regardless\\, I had very high expectations for this movie and it managed to exceed them. Highly recommended for anyone and especially so for star wars fans.","true":true}
