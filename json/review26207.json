Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what the disappointed fans wanted this to be\\, but aside from a few minor weak characters and a few too many jokes this ranks as one of the best movies in the Star Wars franchise. Loved it!","true":true}
