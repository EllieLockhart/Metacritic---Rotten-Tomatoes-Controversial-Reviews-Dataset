This game is all about lying to your face. Gameplay is from 2013 and like 5hr in I could count like 8 zombies. Second part is even worse the coffee scene is a disgrace for this franchise and makes someone almost puke on how low budget the plot is. The game is not perfect but trying to give it a 10 at every turn when this game is filled with bugs and plot holes is just utterly disrispectful towards your fans and consumers and making fanboys fight for a lost cause. The game is less than 0 because there is no significant and true emotional content only pretty graphics with the most distorted story possible. This is a shame on game journalists and media in general not because is bad to like it but because they are unable to look at it's inumerous flaws. People are not happy.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
