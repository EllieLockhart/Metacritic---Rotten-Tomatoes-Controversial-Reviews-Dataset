Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Severely disappointe on three levels. Firstly this year lost opportunity due to certain decisions On what to do or not to do certain characters. It is if JJ Abrams handed Rian Johnson A toolbox with many tools and Ryan chose to disregard most of them without even looking at them. My second disappointment is in the plot and promise. The primary conflict Which drives all of the story is extremely weak and  like a tie fighter without shields full of holes. There are so many times decisions are made\\, actions are taken or not taken\\, and things happen all due to a plot that any second year film student would rip apart. Lastly  on my own personal level the ease in which this franchise has chosen to discard new and old characters insurers there is no reason to get attached to anyone\\, Or even care about their motivation or destiny. It is similar to being asked to care about individual napkins and a bar that is frequently attended. They are used and discarded so quickly no one can even notice.","true":true}
