Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a fan of the sequel for more than 30 years\\, however not a true one who would go after its extension\\,  I like how the story develops. I understand how true fans prefer as there have been well established extension out of the episode 6 since decades ago. But without such knowledge\\, I find the movie pretty good. Enjoy it.","true":true}
