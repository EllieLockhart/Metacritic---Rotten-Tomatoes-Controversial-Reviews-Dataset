Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t get me wrong the movie was beautifully done in basically every way. But I cant ignore the fact that this director thought it was a good idea to have a filler with a main character. And on top of that a lot of questions that needed to be answered were either quickly done or not at all. So in a way I\u2019m glad that JJ will be finishing off the trilogy\\, because this Director got away with so much that effected a lot of us fans. Ps I\u2019m still going to buy this movie on Blu ray and will be rewatching it through out my life. It just felt like it missed out on so much more. ","true":true}
