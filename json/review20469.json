Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan all my life having grown up on episodes 4 - 6. The prequels were disappointing to me but over time I've accepted that\\, while flawed\\, they are Star Wars. Looking back I can filter out what I didn't like about them (Jar Jar\\, midichlorians\\, etc.) and take away the story of Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace. \\n\\nAt first I thought The Force Awakens was weird. The vibe was different than the other Star Wars films; a fusion of modern and classic filmmaking. I did fall in love with it and haven't stopped thinking about it over last two years. It reignited my passion for the franchise.\\n\\nI left The Last Jedi feeling gutted. Not only was it a bad film from a story and pacing perspective\\, it managed to undo everything The Force Awakens put in place. It also altered (for no good reason) the mythos established by the previous seven films. It's a real accomplishment to ruin the character of Luke Skywalker but somehow Rian Johnson did that.\\n\\nI walked out of The Phantom Menace feeling mad. I walked out of TLJ feeling defeated. At this point I'm not looking forward to Episode 9 because everything I was invested in has been either undone\\, altered\\, or killed. I wish I felt what I did walking out of The Phantom Menace -- that would at least indicate passion for the franchise. The Last Jedi made me stop caring about Star Wars and that's a real tragedy.","true":true}
