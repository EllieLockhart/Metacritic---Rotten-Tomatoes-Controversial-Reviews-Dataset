Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is\\, with no doubt\\, an incredible film\\, but as the second movie in a Star Wars trilogy I found it disappointing. The second film in a trilogy should have a larger\\, overarching plot being built\\, deeper character development\\, and a hook or a twist that leaves you immediately wanting more. That's why The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars film and that's why other sequels like The Dark Knight or even Catching Fire were so successful. Now don't get me wrong this was still a great movie and far better than any in the prequel trilogy. But maybe the issue with the prequels was they tried too hard to give us what we wanted rather than give us great films. I think The Last Jedi suffers the opposite problem. Rian Johnson did a fantastic job and made a wonderful movie---probably the movie the Star Wars universe needed. In fact it's probably the movie we all need\\, but definitely not the movie we all want.","true":true}
