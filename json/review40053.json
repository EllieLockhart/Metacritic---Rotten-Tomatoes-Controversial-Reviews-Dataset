Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review that I felt compelled to give for a movie online.As a longtime Star Wars fan since I was a kid I was surprised when I looked at the critics rating versus the audience rating before seeing the movie. Now I understand completely. The movie looked great but I left shocked and disappointed how I could leave that movie feeling so empty. There was no connection and love for the characters and no great script or story. I even found myself looking at my watch half way through. I wanted to love it but couldn\u2019t talk myself into it. Maybe I\u2019m just getting old or living in the past however I thought that the force awakens was great. I wonder what George Lucas is thinking.","true":true}
