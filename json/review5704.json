Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Die hard Star Wars fan since age 5\\, highly enjoyed this wild ride! The Last Jedi stylishly leaves behind the midichlorian mumbo-jumbo of prequels and brings the classic Jedi mysticism back in a totally unique and fresh way. I loved it because it's a Star Wars film I haven't seen before. Instead of recycling the same plot we get something that takes on twists and turns that are totally unexpected in a way that makes me understand why some fans are so thrown off\\, personally I think it's just what this franchise needed to give it life again. It's not perfect\\, yes there is some totally unneeded cheesy-ness and a force ghost scene it would have been better off without but overall it's fun\\, new and totally sexy ! Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill shine and Adam Driver gives the Anakin we deserved in his smoldering and still torn Kylo Ren. Go in with an open mind and you will have a blast!","true":true}
