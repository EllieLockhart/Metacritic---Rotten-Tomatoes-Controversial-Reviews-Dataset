Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It had well-written dialogue\\, good acting\\, funny humor and a number of emotional moments - very much a roller coaster ride the entire time.  In my mind\\, this film captures the magic and mysticism that should be Star Wars.  It's not a remake of Empire; it is very different\\, and I think that's so important.  At some point\\, the Star Wars movies have to evolve and change to be able to continue telling stories that will bring people back to theaters and keep the universe alive for future generations.  And this movie changes a lot for sure\\, but I think these changes are needed.  Until we see the concluding third chapter of this trilogy\\, it's too soon to be overly critical - there still may be many many surprises left before this story ends\\, and personally I'm so excited to see where this journey goes and how the next movie will build upon where The Left Jedi left off.  Overall\\, beautifully original and an excellent addition to the greater Star Wars story.","true":true}
