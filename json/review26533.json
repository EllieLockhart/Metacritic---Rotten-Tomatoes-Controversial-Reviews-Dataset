Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"...oh boy.

I love discussing this movie because it gets to the bottom of how people think stories dm should be told. How do you set up and properly execute a character arc? How do you give satisfying conclusions to character specific subplots? How do you get an audience invested in the relationship between a girl and her sister other than drowning them in exposition? The answers to these questions are key to understanding storytelling for the screen. This movie doesn't get them right. It looked Great though. ","true":true}
