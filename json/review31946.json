Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER\\n\\nMovie was horrible.  A nonstop SJW fest.  Finn is the black slave who ran from oppression and came back to slay his former master.  Rose is the PETA type who wants to save all the animals but doesn't give a rip about those mean human beings.  Rey doesn't need training in order to move giant boulders with her awesome female mind.  Holdo and Leia run the ship\\, and Poe needs to be emasculated before he can learn what \\\"leadership\\\" is about.  Oh and don't worry\\, all the icons of patriarchy like wise old white men will die off in the end\\, leaving you with a ratty crew of droids\\, wookies\\, porgs\\, women and minorities.  And Poe Dameron as the last ounce of masculinity left in the universe.  Oh and Kylo probably cuts his wrists when he's sad.  There's a reason that snooty leftist Hollywood types think this movie is great\\, because it appeals to their highbrow notions of what an enlightened film should be.  In reality\\, it's SJW propaganda dressed up as a Star Wars movie.  And the people know it.","true":true}
