Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to the premiere. It was so dissapointing and so bad that made me miss the prequels. For real\\, the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan on Episode  III was better than this whole movie. \\nI want to know how much money Disney paid to the fake critics for them to say \\\"It is the best movie since Empire\\\". To even put Empire and this piece of junk in the same sentence is an insult\\, not just to the saga\\, but to cinema in general. I'd only seen one Rian Johnson's movie before: \\\"Looper\\\". Of course\\, it was crap. Poor him\\, it's not  his  fault. Disney decided to put a Star Wars episode in the hands of an incompetent asshole. \\nNew characters are literally the most embarrasing thing I've ever seen. Luke's appearence was a complete  waste and an insult to the original trilogy. If this shit didn't have Disney's budget it could've perfectly been a fanmade movie.","true":true}
