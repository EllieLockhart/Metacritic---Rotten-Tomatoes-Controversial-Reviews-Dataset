Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a star wars fan my entire life and this movie. My goodness where to start without dropping spoilers. Let's make it simple\\, this movie tried to do too much and effectively did nothing. This is the first starwars movie that opening night after the first showing there was not an applause. It was a sad scene\\, very depressed. One man stood up and blurted out \\\"what a huge dissapointment\\\". So much could have been done even slightly different and would have made it better. This movie is on my list of disappointments for sure.","true":true}
