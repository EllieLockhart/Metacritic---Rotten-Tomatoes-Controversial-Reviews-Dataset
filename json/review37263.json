Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The perfect movie! Almost too perfect for Star Wars. You don't need to watch 1-7 to enjoy this movie. The real problem is you don't even need Episode 9 either. The movie is complete as is. Rian Johnson is the Star Wars master.","true":true}
