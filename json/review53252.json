Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst in the Skywalker Saga. This episode fails to capitalize on all that was set up before it. Instead it chooses to wipe the slate clean and focus on new characters that while interesting the audience has not had time to get to know and the studio has not invested the time to develop the characters with any significant backstory? Why do we like Rey\\, Fin\\, or Poe? All we know of Rey from the movies was she was abandoned on a planet for several years looking for her parents. Is that all her life ever consistented of? DId she have to fight? Had she ever shown signs of force sensitivity before? All we know of Fin is that he was a stormtrooper. Did he have friends? How long was he a stormtrooper? How long has Poe been a pilot\\, How did he obtain his position? Why do any of them feel a moral obligation to fight for the resistance? None of these very basic and important questions are addressed. It seems the producers and directors were just satisfied with allowing us to fill in the blanks. If that's the case that is the ultimate pinnacle of lazy writing.","true":true}
