Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are so many things wrong in the storytelling in this movie\\, that felt crammed and forced in\\, just to get a reaction from the audience\\, instead of caring about whether or not it fit the narrative of the story. Things didn't make sense and previous plot points were ignored or forced to go in a direction that the director wanted\\, instead of what fit the narrative of the story.","true":true}
