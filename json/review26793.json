Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Once the initial Star Wars charm wears off\\, you start to realize that there's no rhyme or reason to anything in The Last Jedi.  Incredibly cringe-worthy dialogue\\, Luke was completely out of character. (there's a reason Mark Hamill hated this film) Plot holes galore.  Rian Johnson clearly didn't know a thing about the Star Wars universe.  The dialogue felt incredibly hip\\, and modern; this is Star Wars\\, not Earth 2017.  Ham-handed romance just to say there was a romance subplot.  It was hardly even structurally sound from a writing\/screenwriting perspective.  I'm sad to say - it was garbage.  Utter garbage.","true":true}
