{"101487":138527,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In the spirit of \\\"12 Days of Christmas\\,\\\" here are 12 reasons why the Last Jedi was a monumental disappointment:\\n1. Luke Skywalker dies from the exertion of force projection.\\n2. Luke Skywalker\\, the Jedi who saw good in his Space Hitler \\\"Dad Vader\\,\\\" almost killed his nephew in his sleep who hadn't done anything wrong yet.\\n3. Luke Skywalker drinks milk from the teets of a space cow.\\n4. The foundation of the entire movie is the First Order is waiting for the Resistance to run out of gas.\\n5. 30 minutes of casino world purgatory. Remember when they saved the enslaved animals and left the enslaved children?\\n6. Snoke is dead. No revelation about his past.\\n7. Reys parents are nobodies.\\n8. Captain Fasma is dead. Such a waste.\\n9. Leia floats through space like Mary Poppins.\\n10. Han\\, Luke and Leia are not in episode 9 and there is nothing in Rey or Fin's storyline that can carry an entire movie.\\n11. The humor was painfully unhumorous.\\n12. The light speed kamikaze used by Holdo is the answer to every battle from here on out. Just put an X-Wing on hyper space auto-pilot and all dreadnoughts are doomed. They should never lose a resistance pilot ever again.\\n\\nIronic\\, that the one Star Wars movie that didn't say\\, \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\,\\\" left us with a very bad feeling about the entire franchise.","true":true}
