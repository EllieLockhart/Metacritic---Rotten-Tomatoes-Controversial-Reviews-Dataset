Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is generally good\\, good scenes etc. What bothers me the most was what they did with Rey and Kylo\\, I mean\\, what they did not do.\\n\\nKylo is a shit\\, weak and whiny villain. Far from the siths that already existed\\, a disrespect to their memory.\\n\\nRey is completely useless in the movie. A jedi? No training at all and they still want to sell her as a badass.\\n\\nThat's what bothered me the most and made me sad.\\n\\nBut it also has the fact that they simply take the phasm and snoke out of nowhere and without explanation\\, after so much mystery and propaganda of the characters.","true":true}
