Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fan since seeing ANH in 77...  The Last Jedi in a few words\\, messy\\, plot holes galore\\, wasted characters\\, and severely disappointing. I felt empty when I finished watching this film. I should've been sad or felt something when a major character departed but I felt nothing.","true":true}
