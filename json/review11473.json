Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie. I won't see this movie again nor will I see any Star Wars movie this director makes.  The movie was full of stupid jokes\\, forced scenes\\, scenes that went no where\\, harsh language for a star wars movies\\, crazy made up Jedi powers\\, a terrible Luke\\, a flying Leia\\, throws out the movie that came before it\\, milking big bird\\, the list goes on.","true":true}
