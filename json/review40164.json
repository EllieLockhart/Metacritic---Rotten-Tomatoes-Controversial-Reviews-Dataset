Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not real star wars. The plot is like it's written by children. They butchered key characters like LUKE and snoke to make Rey more MaREY sue. This film is full of feminism that it's not even funny.","true":true}
