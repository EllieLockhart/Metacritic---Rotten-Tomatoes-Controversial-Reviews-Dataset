Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed after everything that they did right with Force Awakens\\, they literally threw everything away\\, so many plot holes\\, no respect to Lore\\, disrespect for beloved characters they stablished in the last film\\, bad jokes 40% good jokes 60% jokes that didnt work. it feels like they are making this story on the go.","true":true}
