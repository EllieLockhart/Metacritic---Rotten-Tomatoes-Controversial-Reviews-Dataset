Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll start this by saying I hated TFA\\, primarily because it was a blatant copy and paste of ANH but also because large parts of the plot\\, such as Starkiller Base\\, didn't make any sense at all. The only thing I enjoyed about that movie was Rey\\, Finn\\, and Poe.\\n\\nIn TLJ\\, the story is mostly original so it is slightly better than TFA just for that. However\\, the story they do give just doesn't make any sense where the Resistance is concerned\\, and just isn't satisfying when it comes to Luke training Rey. After RotJ I always envisioned Luke becoming a powerful force user and a strong leader of Jedi\\, which is something the old \\\"Legends\\\" novels did perfectly\\, but here we instead get an old man who just wants to die ...\\n\\nI mentioned that the Resistance part of the story doesn't make sense and it really doesn't. I don't want to post spoilers\\, but the First Order should have easily been able to catch up and destroy them all. This entire plotline serves as nothing more than an excuse to give Finn and Poe something to do\\, and ultimately everything they attempt just ends up being a waste of time. The only characters who actually accomplish anything in this movie are Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo Ren. Everyone else is just along for the ride and none of their actions ever really matter.\\n\\nThe action scenes are good\\, and the new trio are still great characters\\, but the movie itself is garbage.","true":true}
