Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Still the worst Star Wars movie. This is some weird bizarro version of that every 30 min battlestar episode which is infinitely better. There are some great ideas here but they don't land with the Errol Flynn\/Kurosawa\/Man with No name\/ Heroes Journey \/ Space fantasy loving original Star Wars fan base and for good reason. Having said that the direction is good\\, the visuals are stunning - the score is amazing\\, and the cast and acting are phenomenal. It's the story. The story is weak. The pacing is bizarre. The message is overly heavy handed and final\\, which makes no sense because this is supposed to be a middle chapter\\, not an ending. This movie set up every problem in the next one\\, but at least the next one managed to be fun to watch while the nonsense unfolds. Nonsense that is the inevitable direct  result of the choices made in writing this poorly thought out link in a chain. I have no problem with the people who love it for its own sake\\, it has some things in it that are fun and decent ideas\\, it just doesn't do it for me as a Star Wars. You can make a great electric minivan\\, but don't sell it to me as the next mustang.","true":true}
