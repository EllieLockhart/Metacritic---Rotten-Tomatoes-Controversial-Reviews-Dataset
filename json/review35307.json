Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The highlights of this film for me are that it takes the franchise to a whole new direction and that it took risks. Say what you want about this film\\, but it's one of my favourites. It's unique in its own way and that is the reason why I loved it","true":true}
