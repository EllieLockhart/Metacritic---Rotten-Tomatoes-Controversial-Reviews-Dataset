Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with some people that this movie took a lot of what we have come to know about the Star Wars world\\, and turned it all up side down.  But... I LOVED IT!  There were many times in the movie where I was in total shock at what happened.  When I left the theater\\, I had mixed feelings.  But then after it all soaked in\\, and I realized what the reason and meaning behind those shocking things were... I found myself loving the movie even more.\\n\\nThere is a special lore about Star Wars\\, and it's funny because TFA followed that lore perfectly but some fans hated it because it seemed to be just like Episode 1.  Well\\, this movie isn't like ANY of the previous 7 Episodes\\, and these fans are mad about it being so different.  I will be going back to watch it a couple more times at the theater.","true":true}
