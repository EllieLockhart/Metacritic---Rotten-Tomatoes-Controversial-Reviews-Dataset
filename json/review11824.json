Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How this movie has a 91 critic approval is beyond me. Probably paid off by Disney. The plot is full of holes. Rose adds nothing to the plot and is useless. She stops Finn from sacrificing himself even though she talks about how proud she is that her sister died for the resistance. Really unfunny jokes. Kylo is no longer a intimidating villian that J.J. set him up to be. He acts like a enraged 9 year old with schizophrenia. Luke was destroyed. What a abomination of a movie.","true":true}
