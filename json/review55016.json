Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was trying way too hard to be like marvel in terms of humor\\, constant catering to SJWS in terms of screen time and creation of pointless characters. Leia could have easily replaced Holdo for starters. Rose shouldnt have existed\\, have Finn do the mission with Luke and Rey instead; Have Luke properly mourn Han Solo with CHEWIE!! seriously Chewie is hardly there besides being in the background. \\nThis movie just sucks\\, I only liked it better than Force Awakens cuz of Mark and Carries performances in their respectful roles as their beloved characters in THEIR LAST MOVIE together. SPOILER ALERT:\\n\\n\\nLeia and Luke had one scene together. and Luke wasn't even there...... in fact\\, he aint coming back alive for episode 9. missed opportunity to see those two bicker among each other once again. \\nTHIS MOVIE IS NOT CANON straight up. very disappointed. Thanks Rian Johnson for raping my childhood more so than George could ever dream of doing. It just sucks if youre a starwars fan\\, but for a casual\\, I guess you will like it if youre a marvel fan.","true":true}
