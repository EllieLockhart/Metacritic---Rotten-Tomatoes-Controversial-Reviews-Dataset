Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie gets full marks for special effects\\, humour\\, and action\\, but unfortunately\\, low marks for being full of literally hundreds of plot holes that insult your intelligence. The story arch and character development are seriously lacking. The movie ends with Supreme Leader Kylo Ren running the galaxy (presumably he hopes) with Rey... who may join him or oppose him. Rey is a Mary Sue who is more powerful than Kylo after ... (what is it ... six or seven days now?)  since the beginning of Force Awakens where she even became aware of the force.","true":true}
