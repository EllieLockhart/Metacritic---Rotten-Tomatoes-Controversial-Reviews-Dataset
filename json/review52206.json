Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching this\\, I have the feeling it's a parody of a star wars movie.\\nIt reminded me of how penguins feed their chicks: Disney bought Star Wars franchise with intelligent\\, brave and mature antagonists and protagonists ( just compare Darth Maul and Kylo Ren)\\, digested it and cought back a new movie. On the good side you have much to laugh about .","true":true}
