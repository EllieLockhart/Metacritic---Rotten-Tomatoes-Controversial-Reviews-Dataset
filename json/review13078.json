Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what everyone's problem is\\, I thought it was great. Just because the plot doesn't go the way you wanted it to isn't a good reason to crap on it. Everything in the movie made sense based on the current canon\\, and the movie had a good flow and story. STFU you cry babies.","true":true}
