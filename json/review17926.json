Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think Disney got Star Wars confused with Infinity War. Very disappointed. Humor was cheap and out of place. Big subplot questions were answered abruptly and poorly. ","true":true}
