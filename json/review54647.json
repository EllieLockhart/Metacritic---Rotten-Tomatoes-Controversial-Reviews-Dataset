Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, 2nd or 3rd best Star Wars movie.(3rd or 4th if you include Rogue One)\\n\\nWell written. 3 story lines....not busy like some have claimed. I really liked the charactors and the conflicts that they faced. The story flowed in an organic way. I thought that the pace was typical of a Star Wars movie. The roller coaster scenes were fewer and shorter than normal. Which is good...those scenes aren't spectacular or dramatic in 2017. Everybody knows that main acharactors don't die in the middle of the movie weaving through asteroid fields.  I liked the unpredictabilty. I thought that the end was clever. \\n\\nThe movie looked great......IT'S STAR WARS. Stylistically comarable to the two most recient Star Wars movies. Cutting edge without feeling like the inside of a computer. It felt real...but amazing. \\n\\nI loved the actors performances. This is the best set of actors that Star Wars has ever had. They all came to play\\, they took risks and they all brought their A game. \\n\\nI liked the subtext. Please note; many negative reviewers have been panning the story line that involves Del Toro's charactor. Calling it useless and unnessary to the story. However it is within that story arc that the context of the whole movie is being defined. There is a lot of commentary in the Casino World sceens. That stuff is important. It helps set the tone of the movie. \\n\\nI've noticed a high percentage of 0 star and half star reviews......REALLY????\\n0 STARS?????? REALLY????   Worse that \\\"Freddy Got Fingered\\\"? Worse than \\\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III \\\" or \\\"Cat Woman\\\"?  Get Real! \\n\\nI get that some of you wanted something that you didn't get. That's not an excuse to throw a public tantrum. And attempting to NURF the rating of a movie is Sociopathic....a path to the Dark Side that is.","true":true}
