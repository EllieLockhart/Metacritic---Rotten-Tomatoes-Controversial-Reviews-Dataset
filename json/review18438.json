Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is definitely won of the better Star wars movies. I like the action scenes and Ray and Kylo Ren' s fight against snoke's guards is maybe the best light saber fight in the whole series. I like the changes that Rian Johnson made to luke. The only problems is that it is a little to long and the whole part of Luke milking the sea cow was just weriod.","true":true}
