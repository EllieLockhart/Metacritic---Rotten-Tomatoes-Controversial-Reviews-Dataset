Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where were the lore masters when approving this script ??? With a franchise as big as Starwars\\, you better believe that true fans care about the plot and overall consistency. If I were to pick one of the many problems with this story and film\\, it would be the direction they took Luke. His resolve he had at the end of Return of the Jedi\\, I really don't see him trying to kill Ben out of fear. Where are the Starwars lore masters who really know the story? To be fair to the rising stars ie Daisy and John excellent acting. Impeccable acting from Mark Hamil also. I'd say less comedy more serious themes and base a new story off of the foundation that previous episodes already laid. Otherwise it's just not consistent.","true":true}
