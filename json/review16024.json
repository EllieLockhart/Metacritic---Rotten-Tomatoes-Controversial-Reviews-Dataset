Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i'm a huge Star Wars fan but this one is absolutely horrible  in almost every way possible. Choppy.  Doesn't flow well. Forced humor. Cheesy. Corny. Pointless scenes. Ignores the rules of science.  Annoying characters. Annoying creatures. Characters do things that are out of character for them. Weak conflicted villain. Throws away potentially great ideas. Underwhelming","true":true}
