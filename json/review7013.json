Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Starwars film of the whole bunch and that's saying something...\\nIn fact it's not just the worst Starwars film I have seen it's the worst film I have ever seen\\, \\nThey have completely destroyed all the male characters making them all without exception seem either childish\\, pouty or downright stupid\\,\\nwhile at the same time making most of the female characters wise\\, intelligent and superior.\\nThe film plot has so many holes in it and has lots of irrelevant scenes in it\\, The director has shown a complete misunderstanding of the starwars universe and I feel has damaged this franchise beyond repair... The force is pathetic with this one","true":true}
