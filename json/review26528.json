Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of the total of 150 minutes only 30 minutes had cool action\\, and the rest of 120 minutes was nothing more than worthless chitchat. At times\\, and there were many of these\\, they showed close-ups of the actors' faces\\, flipping between the \\\"Good and the Bad\\\" sides\\, just as in cheap Italo-western movies of the seventies. Really ridiculous for the year 2017. 3\/10 points.","true":true}
