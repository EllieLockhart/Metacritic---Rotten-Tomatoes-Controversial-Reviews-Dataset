Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was terrible.  It embraced change for the sake of change.  Really?  Did you really need to?  What was wrong with the old formula?  The low Audience score is telling the tale of why you don't change something just for the sake of change. It can backfire like this.  The critics can love this movie all day but cash in the box office is king.  The next director has their work cut out for them\\, otherwise the Stars Wars franchise will die off.  The special effects were the only redeeming quality but you can't forget the story.  The plot twists were stupid without meaning.","true":true}
