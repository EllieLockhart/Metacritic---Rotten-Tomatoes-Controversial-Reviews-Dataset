Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a landmark in the Star Wars saga because it departs from many of the traditional assumptions of the first 2 trilogies and opens up to a new interpretation of the Force and those who use it. Rian Johnson does a phenomenal job with the visual presentation using bright and colorful worlds. The story takes a different turn nonetheless it leaves you longing for more and curious about how the final chapter will unfold.","true":true}
