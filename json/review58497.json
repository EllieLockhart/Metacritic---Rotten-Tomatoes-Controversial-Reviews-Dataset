We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Just love this game. Graphics\\, lvl design\\, mechanics and story are stunning. Graphics and mechanics in my feelings are 15\/\/10. Story is not as good as the part 1. There are holes\\, it cannot be denied\\, but still... I loved to just \\\"sniff walls\\\" just to admire this attention to details. In my opinion\\, trying to play someone who just killed character from the previous game is something new\\, but they did it actually wrong.\r\rYes\\, from our perspective Joel was a hero for us\\, but what did happen in the Salt Lake City\\, it turned him into antagonist even in me eyes. Even tho\\, that Ellie was for him like a daughter. In the other hand\\, mankind killed his real daughter\\, so maybe he didn't want to save mankind\\, because that would be mean the death of his second daughter. No one\\, except us\\, didn't know about this\\, so for Abby and the others he was just a monster.As a fan of part 1\\, in my opinion\\, killing Joel so fast was wrong. He should die later in the game. Ellie should pursuit to get revenge for killing Dina. \\\"you think I'd let you do this on your own\\\"\\, should be Joel like in trailer. They should get trapped by Abby in the theatre like in original\\, and there Joel should die\\, by what he did to her dad. All the rest of the story should go as it is in the game\\, except ending. Abby should die\\, by Ellie's hand.\rI know what ND is trying to do with her. I'm almost sure\\, they want to make her a main character in part3\\, what is wrong.\r\rBut\\, why I gave this game 10\/10 you ask? it's simple\\, There is only one rating\\, and **** else was just too perfect for me to give it just 10\/10 rating. I want games to look like that. Even the best story is nothing when game is looking awful\u2026 Expand","true":true}
