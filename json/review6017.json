Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointment doesn't begin to describe my experience in watching this film.  Rian Johnson's depiction and treatment of Luke was very disheartening.  I would strongly dispute Mr. Johnson's claim that he is a Star Wars fan.  I share many of the same opinions regarding Luke already shared here and agree with Mark Hamill's comments regarding his thoughts on how Luke was portrayed.  I also agree with many regarding the story and forced attempt at humor.  For the first time ever I'm not looking forward to future installments of my once favorite series.  After seeing this film with friends on opening night I was not looking forward to taking my family to see it the following day but I had already purchased the tickets or I wouldn't have seen it the next day again.  Disney apparently lacked confidence in their ability to move the story forward for new characters without destroying the old characters.   Disney has ruined my experience with Star Wars and for the first time ever I could care less about what's next for Star Wars...\\n\\nnow if this was the sequel for spaceballs then that is another story and my review would be much more positive as it was very funny at times with childish type humor.","true":true}
