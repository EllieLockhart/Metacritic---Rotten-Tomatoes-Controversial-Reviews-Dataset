Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im not sure what people expected. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, but even I admit that we have some of the whiniest movie fans EVER. It's ridiculous. \\\"Fans\\\" complain that The Force Awakens was unoriginal\\, so Rian Johnson accepts that criticism and creates something completely different and unexpected\\, yet those same people still complain. These are people with unrealistic expectations that write the script in their own minds and get angry when it didn't go the way they wanted. If you call yourself a Star Wars fan and didn't enjoy this movie (not asking you to LOVE it)\\, you're crazy and a disgrace to the fan base. You can NOT rehash the story over and over with the same characters. This movie was a changing of the guard. Visually spectacular\\, great plot twists\\, decent humor\\, and a creative way to continue the saga onward. Star Wars must go on!","true":true}
