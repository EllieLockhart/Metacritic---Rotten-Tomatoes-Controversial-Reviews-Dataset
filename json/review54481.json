Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this addition to the Star Wars Saga. I don't understand how the trolls and haters have taken over the movie universe. It's a movie. Some have to high and too many high expectations. \\n\\nFor one. When I spend good money for a good time\/experience at the theater. That is exactly what I got. Thank you Lucasfilm\\, Thank you Mr. Rian Johnson\\, Cast and many more that helped made another good Star Wars movie! \\n\\nYes. Critics\\, I know it is not the best or not as good as Empire Strikes back. Again. Apples to Oranges. Just enjoy Episode 8 and the at this is  latest installment. I am not worries about what the other trolls and haters think. \\n\\nAlso\\,. Thank you for bringing minorities of different races and different sexes into the mainstream. It's about diversity and it's about time! \\n\\nShame on those trolls and haters that just want the same old big thing over and over again. \\n\\nIt is time for a change. It is time for changes. And it is also time for other movie critics to have an open mind and open discussion and not hate bashing on social media\\, etc. \\n\\nI had a good time watching this movie and I will continue to enjoy the Star Wars Saga. Thank you Everyone involved! \\n\\nI got my money's worth. \\n\\nMahalo\\n\\nJon","true":true}
