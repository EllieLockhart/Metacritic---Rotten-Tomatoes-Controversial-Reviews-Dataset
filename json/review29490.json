Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson held true to the Franchise and gave us exactly what was needed. The reveal that Rey's parentage was free of the Skywalker bloodline and born in the sands of Jakku showed us that power can come from anywhere as long as you have the heart to claim it. Luke's brooding was finally supplanted by his yoda-like acceptance of the true understanding of the Force\\, thus finally elevating him to the level of mastery his legend had foisted upon him. Action\\, drama\\, and comedy we're all perfectly balanced in this perfect piece of the Star Wars puzzle. It felt like a true passing of the torch and makes one ravenous for future  installments.","true":true}
