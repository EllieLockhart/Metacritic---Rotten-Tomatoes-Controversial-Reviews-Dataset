Joel went from being a complete hardass and not trusting anyone in the first game to giving personal name and hideout locations to random strangers while being outnumbered lol... it\u2019s a complete mess... the gameplay is linear apart from one section... no new interested infected... sometimes you even forget that it\u2019s a zombie game\\,\\,\\,. It tries too hard to be the walking dead but fails miserably... sorry for the rant because I am personally hurt by this... it\u2019s just a torture porn with lgbtq stuff mixed in it with a horrible story and bland gameplay...the environments in this game are fantastic that\u2019s why it\u2019s getting a 4 from me and the flashback scenes with Joel.. they are the best moments of the game..\u2026 Expand","true":true}
