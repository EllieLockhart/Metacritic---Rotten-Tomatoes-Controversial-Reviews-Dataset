Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ohhhhh boy.  Where to begin.  I'm okay with a long movie\\, but this was busy as all hell\\, yet remained empty.  Ex machina should be part of the title.  You realize that you've been only going in circles at the end and lazy writing is to blame.  Just take a nap and save yourself the frustration.","true":true}
