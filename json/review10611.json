Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Growing up a massive fan of the Star Wars saga I had high hopes for this film\\, however it felt forced and it lacked the special feeling you get from a Star Wars film. I STRONGLY hope Disney reconsiders the new Rian Johnson trilogy after this film. ","true":true}
