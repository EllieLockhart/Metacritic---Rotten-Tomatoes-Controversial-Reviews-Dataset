Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so bad\\, I'm still trying to figure out why critics think this was a super good movie. They completely ruined every character that was established in The Force Awakens\\, subplots that were so boring and irrelevant that you almost had to ask if you were even watching a Star Wars film anymore\\, Snoke ended up being irrelevant and you almost have to ask what was the even point of him\\, Luke's character deserved better than this pile of shit plot and I now see why Mark Hamill was not a fan of any of this material and finally the whole plot itself was literally half assed and so lazy and not to mention if we were to actually calculate the time the whole entire movie was to them\\, it was less than 24 hours. This movie was a huge disappointment\\, and any Star Wars would be out of the right mind to think this was a good movie.","true":true}
