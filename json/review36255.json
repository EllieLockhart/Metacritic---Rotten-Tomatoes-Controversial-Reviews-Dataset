Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Star Wars film I'll ever bother going to theatres for. If you are not the sort of person who turns their brain off to enjoy movies\\, you're probably not going to like this.\\nA lukewarm sci-fi action movie. A big disappointment of a Star Wars movie.\\nDon't waste your time or your money. If you really want to see this\\, wait for video or take to the high seas.","true":true}
