Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone movie\\, its pretty good.  Visually beautiful film.\\nAs part of the saga\\, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Takes a lot of the good feelings from TFA and just tosses them aside.  A lot of fans will take this movie as a middle finger to the fandom.  I wouldn't go quite that far\\, but it pushes the limits of what fans will accept.  Nutshell\\, Disney just \\\"Marvelised\\\" Star Wars\\, and not in a good way.","true":true}
