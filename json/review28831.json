Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"++++ Rating updated from half a star to a full star (!) since is seems that RT does not compute half star reviews...\\n\\nAlso\\, something seems to be wrong when you look at most of the 5 stars reviews. is it just me\\, or do many of those reviews look synthetic\\, generic and unthought of? \\\"best star wars movie ever\\\" \\\"fantastic blockbuster\\\" without even explaining why?...mmmmh\\, weird it seems.\\n\\nThat movie just destroyed my dreams.
