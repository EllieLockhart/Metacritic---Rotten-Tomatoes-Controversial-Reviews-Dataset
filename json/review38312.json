Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst film in the Star Wars series. Why? It doesn't fit with the previous film. It ignores established cannon and rules (hyperspace ramming can't exist as hyperspace isn't just \\\"going fast\\\"). It answers none of the questions posed in the previous film. It turns a character who could have been interesting\\, Rey\\, into a boring shell of herself. The explanation given for Luke is lame. \\n\\nThe problems with the final fight with Snoke are indicative of a director who couldn't be bothered to get the details right\\, but it isn't the only evidence of this. Leia is on the bridge when it is destroyed\\, but it is miraculously rebuilt and fully intact later? How did Kylo flying the ship\\, what is it hallow? The \\\"Canto Bight\\\" thing was a dead end. I could go on\\, but I've already given this mess more thought than the writer\/director did and I have other things to do. ","true":true}
