Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has to be the worst Star Wars film ever created. The holiday special was a better movie. Too many plot holes to count. Plots from episode 7 ignored or resolved badly. The movie felt like space balls 2. Luke's characterization was poorly done. Rey is a master with the light saber with no training. Snoke...what was the point of him? Just too much to type out on my phone. The person who directed this movie should never be allowed to make another film. It's like the writers didn't see episode seven before writing the script...they watched the fifth element then wrote the script. Just so bad.","true":true}
