Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the Last Jedi. The character developments for Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Poe were nicely done and handled. While\\, some complained about Luke\\, I found his reasoning and motivations solid and reasonable. The only things that hinder this movie is a scene with Leia and perhaps a weaker 1st and 2nd act. All the intense action and twists happen in the third act\\, so the film can seem weaker for the first half. However\\, the action and twists are all amazing and executed wonderfully. This movie is completely worth your time to see.","true":true}
