Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is like when your team is Super Bowl bound.  Your team spent the offseason building a talented roster.  You spend the whole season excited about the possibities.  You anxiously await the big day.  You feel really great about the prospects.  All the pieces are there for your team to walk off the field as world champs....and then they shit the bed.\\n\\nThis movie had so many possibilities and Rian Johnson shot them all to hell.  He shit the bed.","true":true}
