Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a terrible movie. Was painful to watch. Literally can\u2019t think of a single thing I liked about it. Was cheesy and boring throughout. Character development was nonexistent and I didn\u2019t care who lived or died. There was no fight scenes.The main villain was an emotional mess. ","true":true}
