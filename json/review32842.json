Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars?  The story arc should have been simple\\, with an emphasis on Rey and her exploration of the force.  Instead we get a muddled journey with far too many plot holes\\, too many space sequences\\, and far too much Leia.  She was dreadful in her Force Awakens cameo\\, but I was willing to overlook this as a nod to Star War's past.  Increasing her presence in the Last Jedi is inexcusable.  Luke wallows in self pity for far too long.  His behavior patterns do not seem consistent with the Luke we watched in the original trilogy.  By the end of the film\\, he is so bored with his role that he decides to phase out of the physical world.  I wish I could do the same to a time when this movie offered the hope of being good.\\n\\nEvil exists in broad strokes in the Star Wars Universe.  We see Rey in indentured servitude\\, Jabba with sex slaves\\, and have watched the genocidal tendencies of The Empire and The First Order.  Other evils exist between the margins and are implicit.  However\\, Rian Johnson decides to use The Last Jedi to delve into specific evil\\, such as animal cruelty and weapons profiteering. \\n\\nFeminism is a welcomed theme in the movie.  Leia is wise and infallible\\, Admiral Holdo is calm\\, and Rey is strong and optimistic.  The male characters serve as foils to the women.  Luke is broken and weak\\, Poe is bullish and impulsive\\, and Finn is cowardly (once again).  However\\, in doing so Rian disregards the motivations and behavior of these characters in past movies.  \\\"The past is dead\\,\\\" can only explain away so much before it loses credibility with fans.  To exacerbate this issue\\, Rian tries to have it both ways on many issues.  He brings back \\\"ghost\\\" Yoda to burn down the Jedi Tree and the \\\"extensive\\\" collection of Jedi history\\, held within a handful of books\\, to remind the audience that ghost-Jedi can return from the grave to guide the living.  \\n\\nI presume the reason Rian had Leia display force powers\\, was so that she could guide and train Rey during the upcoming films.  The door is open for Abrams to reshape the Force.  Perhaps we will get a more nuanced view of good and evil in the the next installment.  The First Order are still comical goons\\, and this movie did nothing to explore their worldview.","true":true}
