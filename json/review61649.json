This game will be available used and steeply discounted in the very near future.\r\rBeautiful graphics can't save this absolutely terrible story. So many plot holes. Most of the character decisions make no sense. Seems that it was written to be divisive for the sake of being divisive. The bait and switch tactic of using new character models in trailer scenes to make you THINK the game is going to involve certain characters is a straight up lie. ND only preying on your feelings for the first game to get you to purchase the second.  I genuinely feel sorry for everyone else who pre ordered this game. The only lesson this game taught me was that i will never pre order anything from NaughyDog. I laughed when i first heard about the leaks\\, thinking there was no way they could be true. It was. It's written like some kind of awful fanfic set in an alternate universe.\r\rThe ending isn't even satisfactory. You will just sit there\\, staring at your TV thinking \\\"why the heck did i just go through all of that\\\"\u2026 Expand","true":true}
