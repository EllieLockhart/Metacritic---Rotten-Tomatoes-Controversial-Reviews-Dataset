Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Animation is absolutely amazing - it might be the best I've ever seen.

They've even got a solid handle on microexpressions\\, and you'll never see a blank face. Even more impressive\\, is that it's not just cutscenes.  During gameplay you'll see tons of animations; so much in fact that the game feels almost cinematic at times. Especially when you get in close and melee enemies.\r\rGameplay is equally impressive and will keep you entertained for hours upon hours - although perhaps not as many hours as needed\\, as the game starts to rely more on more on it\\, the further into it you get. Which brings me to my next point: story.\r\rThe story is a mess. Whether you like the story (or stories\\, I should say\\, as one could easily argue that there are more)\\, the real problem with the story is its structure: it is awful. It starts out solid\\, and remains so throughout it's first chapter\\, but following that it wanes in quality and becomes unsatisfying and at times\\, very pretentious.\r\rLast of Us II is sequel to an amazing game\\, that was always going to be hard to follow. In gameplay it certainly does not disappoint; it's faster\\, more versatile\\, more dynamic. The story however\\, is a massive step down in quality - and I sincerely mean whether you liked the direction they chose or not. I didn't; but I can respect their choice. What I don't like is simply the broken structure. Really bad.\r\rMy last note on this: I am definitely going to play Last of Us again. I do not know if I'll ever play LoU II again. The story gives me nothing but grief (in a bad way) and while the gameplay is really good\\, it's not good enough to carry it for so many hours as the game takes to complete.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
