Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it the greatest Star Wars movie ever? Most definitely not. But it is far from the worst. Was I a little disappointed by the reveal if Rey's parentage? A little bit but that didn't last. The more I think about it\\, the more I like it. It was a fun movie and I liked what they did with Luke. He turned into the disgruntled mentor that we saw in Yoda in Empire. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I will be buying it on Blu-Ray as soon as it comes out.","true":true}
