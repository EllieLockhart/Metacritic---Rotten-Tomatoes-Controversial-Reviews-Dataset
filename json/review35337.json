Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The idiot who wrote this story clearly understands nothing about star wars and thinks it's a f*ing comedy and that you can just fool around with Star Wars lore. And a poor writer with all the inconsistencies\\, loopholes and things that simply don't make sense. The new main cast are as bad as always with little to no chemistry between them. And they portray Luke Skywalker as a retarded bitter\\, breast feeding fool. Watch Return of the Jedi you f*cks at Disney! Luke is not at all as you portrayed him. Oh and\\, apparently you can now destroy death stars easily\\, just fly a few ships at it at the light speed\\, that's all you need in this movie to destroy anything. Stupid movie\\, poor writing\\, total disrespect for Star Wars fans of the original trilogy. This movie is even more a disgrace than TFA was. Wanna have a good sci-fi comedy? Here it is folks!","true":true}
