Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The opening action sequence was really incredible and an excellent start to the film. The rest was OK but the story itself lacked intelligence\\, conflict was too easily created and solutions too easily found making some parts unconvincing. It was good to see Yoda in puppet form though haha!","true":true}
