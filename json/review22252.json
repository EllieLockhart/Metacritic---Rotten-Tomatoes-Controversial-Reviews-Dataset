Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"La peor de la nueva trilog\u00eda\\, que piensa el director al hacer lo que quiera con los personajes y su forma de ser?

La mano derecha del emperador que durante 20 a\u00f1os aterroriz\u00f3 a la galaxia matando a miles de inocentes a sangre fr\u00eda... y estuvo apunto de matar a su sobrino por un sue\u00f1o feo? Que pedo? P\u00e9sima pel\u00edcula en cuanto a personajes\\, pero claro que en cuanto a banda sonora y efectos perfecto\\, como era de esperar.","true":false}
