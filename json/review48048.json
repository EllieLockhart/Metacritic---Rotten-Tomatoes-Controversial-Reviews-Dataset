Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While Rouge One was a much needed shot of nostalgia. The Last Jedi was actually worse than the Force Awakens. Suffice to say the choice to ignore decades of material is a fail. Disney has killed a juggernaut. The box office speaks for itself.","true":true}
