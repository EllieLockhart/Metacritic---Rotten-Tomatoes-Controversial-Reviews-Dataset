Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hyper-drives can be used Kamakaie style and a ship 1\/20th the size can ram another ship and slice it in half. If that is the case\\, why haven't the rebels been doing that ...to take out the much larger empire ships???\\n\\nwhen did Leia get Force training?\\n\\nWhy are Rose and Finn such shitty actors. \\n\\nWhy mention Phasma or Snoke if you are just going to kill them off?\\n\\nWhy such heavy handed politcal elements\\, like animal conservation\\, capitalism and wealth gaps\\n\\nWhy go to Canto?\\n\\nWhere did they get a ship to go to Canto\\, given the hanger was destroyed?\\n\\nIf Tie fighters could catch up to the ship... why didn't they make a boarding party\\n\\nWhy didn't half the pursuing fleet just hyperdrive in front of the Rebels... locking them in\\n\\nWhy was the dark jedi hole such a disappointment?\\n\\n\\\"God's Speed\\\" ? Who the fuck is god? Why not say \\\"May the force be with you\\\"... that is what it means. \\n\\nWhy watch your friends die for 10 minutes\\, before making the decision to slam your ship into Snokes ship?\\n\\nSome good cinematography\\, the only scene worth seeing ...even if it meant Snoke needlessly died.\\n\\nWhy make Luke a comic character drink walrus breast milk. \\n\\nWhy ALL the campy lines...way way too much humor... \\n\\nWhy make Chewbacca a bitch\\n\\nSo...Luke was killed in the end. \\n\\nI am just tired of even thinking about all these flaws","true":true}
