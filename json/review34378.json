Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The baton was passed to the new generation of Star Wars in the most unceremonious way... My hope for the future of this franchise might have faded with the dying of our beloved legends. Their memory forsaken by the clumsy handling of the narrative. The comedy in the film is more indicative to the attitude that director Rian Johnson took to the series\\, almost as if to blatantly disrespect what came before. I love this film because it's Star Wars\\, and I vhelmently abhore it because it's Star Wars. I am torn right in the middle.","true":true}
