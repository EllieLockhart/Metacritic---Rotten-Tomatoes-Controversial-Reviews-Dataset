Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m an original trilogy fan. I\u2019ve watched Rogue One and liked it. But Force Awakens and Last Jedi are huge disappointments. No suspense\\, no payoff. Beloved characters are brought back as token pieces to put fans in the seats. Plot holes galore. Storylines that carry no weight and go nowhere. Easy and dumb solutions. Large portions of film that make need sense. Had some nice small wins and special affects were good. I feel sorry for all the hard work that goes into these films that\u2019s waisted on bad story. Disney has let us down with new Star Wars arc so far and waisted the original arc again with no payoff.","true":true}
