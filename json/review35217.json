Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The franchise is magical even when it's not perfect. I saw he original at age 13 and the opening credits give me the same rush now. Seeing Luke and Leia as older adults certifies this is a timeless classic. May the Force Always be with Us","true":true}
