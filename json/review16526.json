Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a almost trolling manner\\, Rian Johnson is intent on disdaining the traditional themes and plot of the other movies - particularly Episode 7. The whimsical death of Snoke\\, Luke throwing the beloved and iconic lightsaber over his shoulder\\, the burning of the Jedi texts\\, Rey's parents not meaning anything - it's like Johnson wants us to think of ourselves as absurd for revering these concepts and themes in the first place.\\n\\nBut who the hell does Rian Johnson think he is? Guess what buddy we are not impressed by your \\\"interesting\\\" and \\\"different\\\" personal artistic interpretation of something that we do hold sacred. Luke Skywalker is one of the most meaningful heroes in modern pop culture\\, because of his struggle to accept the demons within himself and his family\\, and his courage to overcome them. This movie gave no coherent substance to the rest of his story\\, dilemma or path. Johnson wants us to think the concept of the Jedi is absurd. But they are not - their importance to us and the Star Wars galaxy is perhaps the bedrock of why we love the stories in the first place. Their didactic teachings of what it means to be a good person and how to confront evil both externally and internally is why we root for them with such passion to overcome the great challenges they face.\\n\\nThese characters\\, and themes mean a great deal to us\\, and to the American cultural canon. I find Johnson's arrogant disregard for the real meaning of Star Wars to be disrespectful\\, and frankly selfish. I'm not sure why the 100's of millions of people who watch and revere the Star Wars movies should have what means so much to them be trolled by one director who wants to be \\\"interesting\\\" and \\\"unique\\\".\\n\\nI am also not sure why Lucasfilm\\, Kathleen Kennedy and crew would let JJ Abrams create his appropriate homage to the originals in Episode 7 and then let Rian Johnson crap all over them in the next episode. I hope they can clean up Johnson's mess appropriately in Episode IX.","true":true}
