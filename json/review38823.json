Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They don't seem to have the ability here to post more than a few lines so in short... this movie had the worst script of any Star Wars movie ever.  I'm sickened by how Arian discarded Jedi principles\\, made Luke weak\\, failed to to capatilze on ANY of the great new characters\\, wasted time on irrelevant characters (rose)\\, and filled the film with 2017 politics.  He needs to be banned from making future films associated with Star Wars.","true":true}
