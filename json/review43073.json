Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie will be the most controversial in the series. One of the reasons I feel it will be so divisive is this is one of the few movies where it used cannon in a way that audiences will be \\\"how does that work\\\" one example is how quickly the first order spread from what cannon says that was the plan in the first place. Battlefront 2017 showed they had the man power and then it showed how Poe came up with his crazy dreadnought plan. i am okay with that but over all that will start to cut people out who don't follow the expanded cannon. Though I will admit there are flaws major ones at times with this movie\\, but it isn't as bad as \\\"fans\\\" want to say.","true":true}
