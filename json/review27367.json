Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Other than a few scenes that really didn't work tonally or narratively the rest of the movie is fantastic. I especially like Luke in this movie and I really like Rey and Ren\\, they have a great push and pull chemistry happening. It was also nice to see Leia up on screen one last time.","true":true}
