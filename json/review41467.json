Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a total crap\\, doesn't fit in SW philosophy. So many cheesy lines ruined the SW feeling. I could not accept how Snoke was introduced in SW: TFA - like out of nowhere\\, but I lived with it. But now I cant accept it even more how he is so swiftly eliminated. Rian undid what JJ Adams did in TFA: Snoke\\, Phasma\\, The First order. Everything is pointless. Watch TFA and TLJ together\\, you are left with nothing but VFX. 2 hours without a story. In my heart\\, SW has only 6 movies.","true":true}
