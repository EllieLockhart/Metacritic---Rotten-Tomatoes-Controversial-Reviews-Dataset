Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"UNBELIEVABLE BETRAYAL OF BOTH FANS AND CAST ALIKE!!!  Why on God's Green Earth would anyone greenlight this for production\/release???  Hopefully in Cloud City Heaven we will have the version that should have been...because ONLY JESUS CHRIST CAN RESURRECT THE TIMELESS AND BELOVED TALE THAT WAS STAR WARS!!!  YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE BANK!","true":true}
