Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The take away from this movie is we should leave politics out of the movies. Pointless subplot. The movie is mostly bad so I will point out the things I like. \\n\\n- Luke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s conflict over Kylo Ren\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s drift to the dark side was interesting and the Luke I know would (I believe) have had that struggle considering what he went through with his father. \\n- I like the salt planet. Not sure why some folks don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t like that. Not sure about those silver foxes but they did have a purpose to show the rebels how to get out. \\n- I like the Rey and Kylo relationship. Interested in seeing how that evolves. \\n- Mixed on how Luke is dispatched. I thought he should have had a MUCH BIGGER role instead of spending all his time wallowing around on his island. I do KIND of like the parallel to Obi Wan\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s demise but still...Obi Wan has an amazing story before that happens. Luke\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s story line was uninteresting and then he died. That was an injustice to an iconic character. I don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t think Rian Johnston understands the character. \\n\\nBTW saying that everyone who hates this movie is a bot and leaving a 5 star review is petty and untrue. MOST people felt this movie did not live up to it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s potential. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. If you like it great! Leave a favorable review but if you\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)re someone who\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)s upset that people hated this movie\\, leave a 5 star review and then insult everyone who hated it I don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t think your rating should count.","true":true}
