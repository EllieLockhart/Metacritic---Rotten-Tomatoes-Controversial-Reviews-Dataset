Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not feel like a Star Wars movie. I got more of a Star Trek vibe. The humor was unnecessary\\, plenty of build up in the force awakens and the leaves you hanging in this movie without answering questions. The movie is Rey following Luke on an Island and the first order following the resistance slowly in space.. the end ","true":true}
