Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie was visually spectacular\\, the story was butchered to the point that very few things made sense in the movie. The problem with a movie like his is that with a preestablished universe\\, you have to be careful when doing different things because while the outcome of a new idea or concept might be good\\, it may completely contradict previously established parts of the universe and make the movie confusion to previous viewers. In this movie\\, it was so all over the place\\, the space battles made little to no sense while interpersonal interactions were both confusing and nonsensical for the situation. All in all\\, the movie suffers from writers and directors that have little interest in the universe they are writing in and this shows when a movie like this is produced with so many plot holes based on the canon information\\, but also poor story telling and character development. It's a shame too because I was expecting a lot better.","true":true}
