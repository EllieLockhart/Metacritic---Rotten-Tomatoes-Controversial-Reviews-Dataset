Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"HA! Now you all know how us Trekkie's felt about JJ taking over Star Trek. This movie was terrible from start to finish. Whether you're talking about the ridiculous rebel plan\\, the under-use of Mark Hamill\\, the random-ass death of Snoke\\, basically ripping off the battle of Hoth\\, or the PORGS\\, you're in for a terrible time. You Star Wars fans deserve better\\, and this is coming from a Trekkie. Last time I ever buy a movie ticket for a Star Wars movie. Oh\\, also forgot to mention that casino race that made me actually nostalgic for pod racing. Save your money\\, watch Rogue One on NetFlix.","true":true}
