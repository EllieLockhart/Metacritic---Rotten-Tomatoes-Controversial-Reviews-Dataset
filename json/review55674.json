Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok I may be a little biased because I knew Steve and Rian way back when in the dawn of time... But... It was like Star Wars has been running with ankle weights for 40 years and they just took them off. It was better than perfect it was concentrated Star Wars essence with all the things that bothered me removed and all the things I had hoped and dreamed of added in double with extra surprises. The laughs kept you from going over the edge with stress\\, but there were plenty of nail biting moments.  From the message to the added complexity to the basic humanity it was amazing. All the ways Lucas had failed in 1-3 Rian was able to pull off beautifully. And the visuals were stunning with subtle meanings.  The students have definitely passed the master.","true":true}
