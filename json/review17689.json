Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It betrays the spirit of Star Wars. It destroys Luke Skywalker to the ground. Its so painful to watch\\, its like my childhood was destroyed in front of my eyes. \\nI still can look the good filmmaking and all that\\, but it just\\, its more disappointing. So sad for star wars and this trilogy. ","true":true}
