Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the critics even watch the same film? Wasted characters.... snork\\, Poe\\, Luke.....the whole Finn part of the story was pointless. Should have just cut that. Seemed like they were preoccupied with trying to fit in as many opportunities to introduce new cute animal-like creatures as possible.... which I hate to say....was still the best part of the film. Didn't seem to fit with the previous movie too well either.... lots of building up to.... well.... nothing.","true":true}
