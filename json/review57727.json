Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible film princess Leia turns into Mary Poppins\\, luke Skywalker and the green milk. why just why would you do it? Rey no training but the most powerful in the galaxy snork may as well not have turned up in\\, fin completely wasted in this movie\\, if Darth Vader had had Force powers it would have all stopped in the first film because he would have annihilated\\, everybody and to top it off\\, a diabolical storyline","true":true}
