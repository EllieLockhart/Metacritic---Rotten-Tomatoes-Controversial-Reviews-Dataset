Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't a Star Wars movie.  I love Star Wars\\, always have.  This wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, not in the sense that George Lucas made it.  It was Disney turning Star Wars into another crappy Marvel universe that they can do whatever will make them money with\\, by throwing away established lore\\, characters and rules.  The other reviewers have covered it pretty well.  I'll say this though\\, the biggest\\, most unforgivable sins were\\, 1) Luke Skywalker as a character has been ruined.  Why would he see the good in Vader\\, but try to kill Ben in his sleep?  Especially when Vader was Space Hiter and Ben was a kid.  Give me a beak.  2) Rey is a Mary Sue.  There's no denying it now.  With no struggling or development whatsoever\\, in a matter of a couple days\\, she's as powerful as Kylo\\, who was trained under both Luke and Snoke.  Again\\, give me a break.\\n\\n\\nStick a fork it in it folks\\, Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
