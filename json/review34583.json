Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest problem this film has\\, is that Disney completely ignored all the emotional attachment an entire generation had garnered towards Luke Skywalker. I watched it twice\\, and I won't be watching it again. Ever. I skipped Revenge of the Sith because of how awful the first 2 prequels were\\, I suspect I'll be skipping episode 9 now. Sad day indeed. :(","true":true}
