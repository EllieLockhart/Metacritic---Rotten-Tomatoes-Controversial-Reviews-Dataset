We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"It is pretty hard to put my thoughts into words so if I look at specific points without spoiling the game then:\r\rPositives:\r-Graphics: Graphics are a high level and the detail and passion that went into the product is visible.\r\r-Animation: Excelent animations\r\rNegatives:\r-Gameplay: this is more a personal problem as I had this with the first one too. Though I had hoped they would have changed \/ improved more in 7 years.\r\r-Characters: This is where a major problem lies. Established characters act out of character and there is no development. A certain character who I will not name ends up being someone you play as and at the time you get there you feel nothing for that character or the ones around them. Also it is fine that they want to show you a revenge plot but they figuratively and literally spit on older characters.\r\r-Plot: I have seen a revenge plot a hundred times and I also seen it a hundred times better. You miss a connection when you just killed hundreds and now should feel bad about a single one.\r\r-The ending: I don't wanna spoil the ending\\, but let's just say the end feels empty like ash in your mouth as the whole goal of the game is not reached at the end.\r\rI personally love the last of us 1. But 2 misses the point of the first game completely and ruins characters. For me who finds story in games important this isn't a game for me. I would. I would\\, however say that if you're a person who liked the last of us 1 gameplay and visuals that you might like this too. I personally had hoped this game would reach new heights\\, but sadly instead of new heights it has reached a deep low point for me.\r\ri rate it a 4\/10\rp.s can't seem to score it that way else it won't accept\u2026 Expand","true":true}
