Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has created the visual equivalent of navigating the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs - it shouldn't have been possible.  \\n\\nI loved The Force Awakens\\, I relished in its retreading of A New Hope and fell in love with the new characters\\, the new score\\, and all the questions that JJ Abrams left unanswered.  But as the sequel grew ever closer\\, I slowly came to terms with how unsatisfying the answers would inevitably be.  I couldn't imagine a way that it wouldn't feel contrived; but alas\\, my fears were unfounded.  The Last Jedi navigates those waters with the utmost skill\\, finding the best possible course through those narrative mines\\, taking unexpected turns and delivering on the emotional promise of this new series.  \\n\\nTo those who have yet to see this movie\\, understand that those turns might not be for you.  If you want the original series to be retold\\, then this is not the trilogy you are looking for.  But if you want something new\\, yet something wholeheartedly Star Wars - then strap in.  Go in cautious\\, it's always better to go in with lowered expectations\\, but don't let those decrying this film steal your hope.","true":true}
