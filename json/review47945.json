Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it fails to capture the same \\\"feel\\\" that The Force Awakens did\\, I still found The Last Jedi to be an overall enjoyable ride. There are a few things that I didn't like\\, and a few things that left me scratching my head\\, but there were also plenty of moments that left me awestruck. In the end\\, I had a good time watching the film\\, and I think that is what matters most. I'm eager to see how they close out the trilogy.","true":true}
