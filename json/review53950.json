{"101487":129328,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge fan of the original trilogy\\, absolutely cannot stomach the prequel trilogy\\, and immensely enjoyed both The Force Awakens and Rogue One.  If you're of a similar mind\\, then you're in for a treat.\\n\\nSome fans derided The Force Awakens for being too similar to A New Hope.  While The Last Jedi has elements that will remind fans of The Empire Strikes Back\\, the movie follows its own path and introduces surprise twists that virtually insure that Episode IX will be unlike  any of its predecessors.\\n\\nAddendum: There have been many fan reviews giving this movie 1\/2 star and calling it every name in the book.  These ridiculously negative reviews are not in keeping with either the critics' reviews or the reviews of ANY Star Wars fans I know personally.  Most of the really bad reviews seem to come from several camps:\\n\\n(1) There are some fans out there who want ALL Star Wars films to be all about Luke\\, Han\\, and Leia\\, starring the original cast.  I get it - we loved the original films and crave more\\, but their part in the story has already been told\\, and the torch has been passed on\\, just as it was (retroactively) passed between the prequels and the original trilogy.  Sorry to say it\\, but Episodes VII-IX were NEVER going to be \\\"all about the old gang\\\"\\, no matter WHO directed the films.  If that's all you care to see\\, then fine - put Episodes IV-VI on auto-repeat.\\n\\n(2) There are some extremists who are still butt-hurt that Disney scrapped the Expanded Universe\\, and so they will deem ANYTHING Disney does as \\\"the worst film ever made\\\".  These people have no interest in posting honest reviews - they're basically pouting and throwing tantrums because they didn't get their way.\\n\\n(3) Let us not forget the creatures known as Internet trolls\\, who exist to anonymously heap invective on anything they can.  Plenty of those out there\\, many of whom are also in camp (2).\\n\\nThere are\\, I am certain\\, people out there who genuinely didn't like the movie for one reason or another\\, and that's fine: to each his own\\, as they say.  For my part\\, I'll say this: I have thoroughly enjoyed A New Hope\\, The Empire Strikes Back\\, Return of the Jedi\\, The Force Awakens\\, Star Wars: Rogue One and The Last Jedi and give them all grades from A- to A+.  All had their flaws - none were perfect - but I enjoyed all of them immensely\\, unlike The Phantom Menace\\, Attack of the Clones\\, or Revenge of the Sith\\, which I would grade D+\\, C- and B\\, respectively.","true":true}
