Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am trying to just convince myself this movie never happened. They make Luke look like a weak unlikable grumpy old man. Poe an idiot who caused the fleet to be destroyed. The resistance to be another side of the same coin as the Empire\\, aka \\\"everyone in war is bad\\\".\u00a0 Jedis as not being good or bad or useful.\u00a0 Chewie is sidelined. R2 and C3PO sidelined.\u00a0\u00a0 Finn is a coward until the end where he is about to make a heroic sacrifice but then the worst character since JarJar\\, Rose\\, saves him and makes a stupid speech about how love and not fighting will win the war. Even Leia is odd\\, she litteraly gets sucked out into the void of space and uses the force to fly back to the ship. I can't even express my hatred for the new creatures made to please kids. Damn Porgs. Also the whole plot was completely pointless because the star destroyers could just jump in front of the resistance ship and blow It up. The whole going into hyperspace to ram the ships and blow them up makes all of star wars pointless because they could've just done that to the death star or any other threats. It seems like the director\/writer were out to sabotage this series. I'm not even scratching the surface of what's wrong with this movie. They need to scratch this and remake it. It's the only way for them to save Star Wars. #RemakeVIII #Notmyluke #SithRianJohnson","true":true}
