Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Life long star Wars fan here. HATED IT. Luke is an ineffectual nothing. All that build up in the first movie to finding him...only to have him do nothing of consequence and then choose to become a force ghost. I am appalled at Disney's version of Star Wars. After two movies--why am I supposed to care about Rey? Because she's fetching to look at? That's about all we have been given after 2 movies. She's a terrible major character based on what we have been given. Same with Finn. He *almost* made me care about him when he was going in for the suicide mission\\, but another shoe-horned in character rammed him and stopped him from being heroic. Zero character development of any of the new cast. If I didn't see the old cast develop over time way back when\\, I wouldn't have cared about them in either of these movies. Plus\\, too many jokes felt out of place and sooo much in your face describing plot points so kids can follow along really took me out of the movie. This writer\/director learned nothing from Rogue One.","true":true}
