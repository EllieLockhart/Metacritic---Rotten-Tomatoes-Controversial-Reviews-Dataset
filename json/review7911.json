Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Expertly executed trash. Rey and Kylo are the highlights\\, but they aren't given jack to work with story-wise. How in the world professional critics have an average rating of 8.2\/10 is beyond comprehension. The 56% audience score (at the time of writing this) is completely fair.","true":true}
