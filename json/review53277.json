Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete dumpster fire. The Force Awakens left so many temping cliff hangers\\, wonderful characters\\, and plot points to explore. Unfortunately\\, The Last Jedi decided to cut out all the avenues for plot development while simultaneously leaving the characters feeling bland and underdeveloped. Characters felt utterly protected by plot armor\\, and there were so many potentially amazing moments of sacrifice that were quickly ruined by stupid ret-con esque deus ex machinas or some obvious flaws in the entire premise of the conflict that were never addressed.\\n\\nIts only saving grace is that it's moderately funny. However\\, this style of quick humor (a mix of slapstick and 5th grader level toilet humor) feels utterly out of place for the normally witty humor of a Star Wars movie\\, and was overused to the point of saturating scenes which should have been dramatic and tense.\\n\\nAll in all\\, this movie felt like a slap in the face to anyone expecting any kind of actual plot development or even a decent Star Wars movie. I'm almost ashamed this is cannon\\, and I can't fathom to understand why so many experienced movie critics are giving it such a high score seeing as Mark Hamill didn't even like it....","true":true}
