Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible and worse than the force awakens. Acting\\, special effects\\, plot\\, storyline\\, all horrible.  I really wanted to like it. Please save your money do not see it. Wait for another movie. If you really want to see this at home. But even then you should probably just skip it. I am sorry for the bad news.","true":true}
