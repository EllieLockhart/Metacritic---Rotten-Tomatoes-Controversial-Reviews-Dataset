Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have a Star Wars toys that I've had for almost 40 years that I now have to toss in the garbage. Johnson And Disney have messed up part of my childhood. It's crazy how much I have been thinking about this horrible movie \\nAnd how depressed I am. I have been through a divorce and that feels like a death\\, somewhat the way this movie has made me feel. The  prequel's were bad but The Force Awakens helped to redeem the mess that was created. I don't see a way for any type of Redemption\\,  especially now that Disney and Johnson wanted this. Very sad.","true":true}
