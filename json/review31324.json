Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some good action sequences and fight coordination don't prevent this film from falling on its face. The plot is thin and an entire Side Story proves to be uneventful and unnecessary. The characters you know and love seem to make decisions are completely out of character.","true":true}
