Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not that good.  You can tell that it was hastily rewritten by a second person.  There are all manner of inconsistencies in the plot such as using \\\"light speed\\\" as a weapon.  Makes zero sense.  The purple haired female rebel leader was obnoxious too.","true":true}
