Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"absolutely the worst star wars I have ever seen.  From a movie perspective it didn't work\\, it didn't make sense.  Not even getting into the fan based backlash\\, it was long\\, boring\\, stupid\\, nonsensical and just plane pointless.  The humor was childish\\, the action as well - why were y-wings setup like b52's and atmosphere in space meant nothing...  I honestly felt like I was watching a slow ass michael bay movie transformers with no plot or story.  absolutely terrible.  I hope the episode 9 starts out with luke waking up from a terrible nightmare given to him by the force\\, and he walks out of his hut and finds Rae standing with his light saber and just pretend like episode 8 was a bad dream.","true":true}
