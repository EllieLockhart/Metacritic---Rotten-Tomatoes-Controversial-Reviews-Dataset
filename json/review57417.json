Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a mess. \\nIt disrespects beloved star wars characters(and therefore fans)\\, and poorly manages new ones. \\nThe plot was entirely pointless\\, we got no answers to any of our questions from awakening(which I liked\\, and was excited to see where it was all going)\\, but it turns out it was going nowhere\\, the movie ends with all of the resistance dead and the heroes validly calibrating like 20 of them escaping???\\nThen there\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s the character development\\, all of the villains are weak baffoons\\, and all of the heroes stumble along from disaster to disaster making no personal sacrifices or growth but failing constantly while continuing to blindly profess virtue where their is only harm done to the greater good over stubborn personal belief. The original trilogy (even the prequels)\\, were based deeply in archetype\\, and therefore had a truth to share\\, which connected with the audience effortlessly on a deep meaningful level. The last Jedi does the opposite\\, it heavly invests itself\\, not in reality\\, but rather in ideology\\, trying vainly to force its plot to fit its clunky socially contrived narrative. Resulting in a story that would make a good cautionary tale in how-not-to-be\\, instead of the archetypical heroic journey that shows one how to be.\\nThis movies is Visually stunning\\, a cinematic masterpiece of videography\\, and the sound was just as good\\, it\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2 1\/2(TM)s the only quality in the film.\\nI could go on and on in detail about how colossally this film fails\\, but all things considered\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is best summed up metaphorically by its light speed kamikaze attack. It ruined space combat (ya know\\, War-in-the-Stars: Star Wars) thereby making the plot of 4\\, 6 and even its reboot predecessor 7 void\\, it ruined Star Wars. Period. It needs to be expunged\\, this movie is not cannon\\, it cannot be\\, which is a shame\\, because we lost Leah to it.i","true":true}
