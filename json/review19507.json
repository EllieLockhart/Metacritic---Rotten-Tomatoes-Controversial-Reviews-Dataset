{"101487":143656,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's too soon to tell\\, but this might be my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. And I've been a fan since the beginning\\, I saw the first one in the theater when I was 5 years old. One of the things that I loved was that they returned to the arc of Luke Skywalker's spiritual development after 30 years\\, and successfully brought it to a very satisfying conclusion. Lucas' scripts for the original trilogy were shot through with Eastern mysticism. They followed Luke learning about the things he needed to let go of to achieve enlightenment. Yoda tried to tell Luke \\\"wars not make one great\\,\\\" and that going after Vader out of anger\\, revenge\\, fear for his friends wasn't the answer.  Luke fights and fails. It's only in ROTJ\\, when he refuses to fight his father\\, that he succeeds\\, or rather\\, the Force succeeds when Vader comes to recognize himself in his son. Vader is enlightened and the Emperor's grip on him is broken.  It's a fantastic story\\, in which the allegory of the spiritual journey is also taken literally\\, and openly discussed. Fast Forward to the Last Jedi. We find Luke - well\\, closer to where he has always been than some fans had hoped\\, I guess. Still angsty. Still torn. The same\\, but more so\\, with his failures weighing heavily on him. He's going through the dark night of the soul when we meet him\\, it's a painful place\\, but often a necessary step preceding great strides forward. (As an aside\\, I love his \\\"training\\\" with Rey where he gently mocks her\\, pretending the reed is the Force and then whacks her with it. It's funny\\, but its also legit Zen Buddhist training practice. Yes\\, sometimes they hit you with a stick\\, just so. Possibly my favorite scene here\\, calling back to Lucas' interest in Eastern religion in the 70s\\, while also working in the moment). Anyway Rey's presence and contact with Kylo forces Luke to address his failures and advance. And he does! When these movies were announced\\, I must admit I was very worried they would undo Luke's spiritual progress from the original movies in order to give him an excuse to kick ass with a lightsaber. But Luke more or less rejected violence and war in ROTJ\\, to have him fighting again would be a huge step backward! Here\\, he does not do that. Instead of fighting\\, he finds peace and ascends\\, becoming one with the Force. In the last act\\, he makes good on Obi-Wan's promise to become \\\"more powerful than you can possibly imagine.\\\" He is able to project himself as a Force Ghost even before his body is finished dying\\, which is the most impressive thing a Jedi has ever done. But he doesn't fight. He asks for his old pupil's forgiveness\\, and returns to his role as a Zen teacher\\, mocking Kylo Ren gently with the same words he uses with Rey\\, \\\"Amazing! Every word you just said was wrong.\\\" The conversation from which the film draws its title is a highlight of the series for me. Luke's triumph is so vast it leave poor Ren spluttering and impotent. He didn't even know the force could do these things - allow you to transport yourself across the galaxy\\, but also allow you to let go of your suffering and find peace. Luke's apotheosis takes the previously muddled philosophy of the Force and makes it clearer\\, which makes all the movies better by contact. Wars not make one great\\, and once again Luke triumphs by not fighting. The nitpicks I hear from some of these other reviewers are mostly from people who don't understand the philosophy and characters of the original trilogy the way Johnson does. Take Rey's non-training. In ESB\\, Yoda insists that Luke needs to complete his training\\, but in ROTJ he says\\, \\\"no more training do you require.\\\" That's not an inconsistency\\, Yoda has grown and changed his mind. All of Luke's criticisms of the Jedi in TLJ are on point\\, and Yoda wouldn't disagree with any of them\\, although he disagrees to Luke's clinging to his failure and disillusionment\\, as it's keeping him from achieving enlightenment. \\n\\nAnyway\\, that's all just to say that I love what they did with Luke\\, it works for me because it fits so well with what Hamill was doing in ROTJ so long ago\\, and retroactively makes that a better performance. Also\\, since I was young I've had this image in my mind\\, of a lone warrior\\, facing down a huge\\, monstrous force. Alone. Against the overwhelming attacking force\\, the warrior doesn't even have modern weapons\\, and draws a sword. At the end of this film\\, Rian Johnson comes very close to staging that very scene\\, but then subverts it brilliantly. Luke\\, just as he did in the Emperor's throne room\\, refuses to fight. Violence is terrible\\, and anyway he loves his nephew\\, even now. \\\"I'll be with you every day\\, like your father is . . . See you around\\, kid.\\\" HA!\\n\\nI was so disappointed by the prequels\\, I pretty much stopped calling myself a Star Wars fan. I really felt like I disagreed with Lucas about what made Star Wars special in the first place. I give this five stars\\, while it isn't perfect (the Casino bit . . . had some room for improvement)\\, it's great. I felt like I finally got a full-on sequel to ROTJ. And the ending - I laughed\\, I cried\\, the movie made me feel better about EVERTHING\\, and may have made me a better person.","true":true}
