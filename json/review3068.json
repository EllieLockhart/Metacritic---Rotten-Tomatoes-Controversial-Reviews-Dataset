Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"bad script = boring movie ... supposedly a Star Wars fan...Johnson seemed more concerned with making Luke a flawed character than a noble one.This was missed opportunity.There were a couple of good scenes in this movie.But I felt nothing at the end of the this movie.Not enough action and very little suspense.Made me wonder if he has actually seen a Star Wars movie?","true":true}
