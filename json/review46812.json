Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well let's see. Luke was portrayed as a coward. He was going to murder Ben Solo because he was scared of him. He exhausted himself and instead of resting he just\\, what\\, died? Really? Rey is now a Jedi master apparently despite having no training. No real character development on Poe or Finn. Kylo still doesn't have a clue what he wants. Snoke\\, this big bad Force user\\, is snuffed out like he was nothing and we still don't know who he was or where he came from. Rey's parents were nobodies? She couldn't have been a Palpatine or Kenobi? Something\\, you know\\, actually interesting? The entire sub plot of trying to shut off the hyper space tracker was utterly pointless and a waste of time. The space chase was absurd. Ugh. Just\\, ugh. This film was horribly written\\, the story was dumb\\, the characters lifeless. This wasn't Star Wars.","true":true}
