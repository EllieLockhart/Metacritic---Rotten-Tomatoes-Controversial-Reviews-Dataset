Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If this was another movie I might have given it a better score. But it isn't\\, it's StarWars and ever since Disney took over it has become more of an out with the old and in with the new. The movie looks great visually. Something is missing in the dialog once again. The Lightsabers don't really sound like lightsabers and there are plot holes Galore. I will not watch another Disney produced Star wars film which basically means I will not watch another Star Wars film.","true":true}
