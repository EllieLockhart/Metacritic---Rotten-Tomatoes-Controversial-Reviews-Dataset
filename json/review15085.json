Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this movie feeling so frustrated.  There are some great scenes\\, but after a couple good scenes there would be one that was just so ridiculous it totally would remove me from the movie.  Major plot holes\\, characters showing up in places with no real reason\\, just to get someone out of a jam.   We all expect the far fetch with science fiction\\, but for crying out loud if I was pursued to a fortress\\, with one big door\\, I would close the door\\, not stand in the doorway.......\\n\\nThere is a solid  1 hour 45 min five star movie here\\,  problem is the run time was 2 hours 30 mins.","true":true}
