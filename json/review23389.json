Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! This is the movie that has ignited my interest in getting more into the Star Wars fandom (I've always been a casual fan). The acting is superb. It has some flaws\\, but overall\\, it is a great movie. In fact\\, it is the first and only movie I have seen three times in theaters. Highly recommend!","true":true}
