Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone hoping JJ will save this sinking ship is deluding themselves. He produced this slowmotion train wreck and if Greg Grunberg is to be believed JJ said of Rian's script: 'It's so good\\, I wish I were making it.' The original  ending to TFA where rocks are floating around Luke? Maybe making sense of that last helicopter shot? Later redacted because of Rian's incredible new vision.\\n\\nRian had no idea where he was steering this franchise. His stated idea to test each character sounds good as a device to generate a dramatic movie. Except he didn't do that. He doesn't know who any of these characters are. He had a number of set pieces he wanted to put on film. The character's `decisions' in this film only make sense when they are just agents setting up these ludicrous situations. \\n\\nTo fill the gaps we get constant `gotcha' moments. A startling twist that shows events or characters in an entirely new light? We didn't get those. Just tepid reversals or uninspired revelations. And so many that we are left unmoved by scenes when we start to expect them to be reversed moments later. \\n\\nAs the credits roll there is no anticipation for what happens next. The executives in charge of this series do not care. Why should you?","true":true}
