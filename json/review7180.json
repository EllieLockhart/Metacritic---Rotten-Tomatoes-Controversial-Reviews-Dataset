Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyed this movie\\, would see again\\, and probably will. The \\\"Lay the past to rest in order to begin anew\\\" message really resonated both within the text and for the series itself.","true":true}
