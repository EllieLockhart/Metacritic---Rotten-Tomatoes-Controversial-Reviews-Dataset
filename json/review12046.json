Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually enjoyed this movie\\, apart from some dumb stuff that sticks out on repeat viewings. The plot has some major issues but is still an enjoyable time. The theme of failure and learning from it is treated well\\, although it does over-permeate the movie in my opinion. I was ok with the plot twists and daring story choices\\, even if they weren't my favorite and I may have preferred something different. Overall\\, I didn't love it but I can't bring myself to hate it like half of the internet.","true":true}
