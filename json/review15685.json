Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED this movie.  I am not sure what all the negative reviews are about.  I was born in 1971 and have been a die hard Star Wars fan all my life.  This movie was great!  Can't wait to see it a second (and third\\, fourth\\, etc...) time!","true":true}
