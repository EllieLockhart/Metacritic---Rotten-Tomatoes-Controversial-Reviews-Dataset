Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a good movie. It's entertaining and the cinematography was fantastic. That being said\\, it has more than a few problems. \\n\\n1.) The comedic relief fell flat. In particular\\, the opening battle features an almost cringeworthy exchange between Poe and Hux.\\n\\n2.) It cheapens the first six films. The Jedi Order of the Prequels are portrayed as failures. Luke\\, Han and Leia are failures. Basically\\, the entire Star Wars saga is now meaningless. \\n\\n3.) The Last Jedi seems to ignore most of The Force Awakens. None of our questions are answered. Who is Snoke? Nobody! Who is Rey? Nobody! The Knights Of Ren aren't addressed at all\\, as if that subplot was completely abandoned.\\n\\n4.) Who is Luke Skywalker? That was JJ Abrams' big question when writing Episode 7. He decided to leave that question to Rian Johnson\\, who decided Luke was a deadbeat hermit who wants nothing to do with Han\\, Leia\\, the Resistance or the Force.","true":true}
