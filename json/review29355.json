Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson clearly wanted to make a Guardians of the Galaxy film but Disney said he could write star wars instead. Deaths of fan favourites are immediately devalued by the over the top slapstick comedy and one liners i would expect from a sequel to spaceballs.\\nUtterly different film from what the trailers and interviews were selling.\\nUtterly disappointing second outing for a cast i spent the last two years warming to. \\nIt was not a send off to Carrie Fisher and i find some of the sequences involving her disrespectful to one of the greatest female sci fi characters of all time. \\nLuke is a joke in this film\\, none of the questions you care about are answered. The first half is completely nonsensical and the second half doesn't do enough to save it. \\nIt's the worst star wars film to date\\, don't you dare liken this to empire strikes back.","true":true}
