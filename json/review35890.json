Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the most complex story we have seen to date in the Star Wars saga. It breaks the white hat\/black hat\/light side\/dark side formula that we've come to expect. This is not another movie from my or your childhood. That\\, perhaps\\, is the problem for a vocal minority of fans who don't like TLJ. Without risking spoilers\\, characters in TLJ do not act as we expect Star Wars heroes and villains to act. Instead of god-like and faultless heroes\\, we get failure and disappointment. The villains falter. Just keep in mind that one of if not the most important themes in Star Wars is redemption after the fall. This movie is filled with a lot of the latter and a bit of the former. Failure: dwell upon that notion and think about all of the Jedi masters we have encountered. Remember also that this is the middle of this trilogy's arc and that the heroes we see are not written as gilded statues but as real people with real flaws.","true":true}
