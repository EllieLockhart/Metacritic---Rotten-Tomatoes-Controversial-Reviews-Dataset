Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total crap that makes the original trilogy pointless.\\n\\nLuke decides to go into exile for a one man pity party leaving the universe to burn because the Jedi need to end in his eyes....the Sith on the other hand he's fine to leave as they are...makes sense.\\n\\nSnoke...pointlessly killed\\, no back story.\\n\\nCheesy not needed side stories.  The whole thing was utter poo.","true":true}
