Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first I was convinced I was going to give this a 3 star review based on my initial impression - which was a mixture of dissatisfaction and complex confusion. Now\\, after consistently thinking about the movie every moment since I saw it on Thursday\\, I realize the good moments outweighed the few bad ones. I did leave wanting more\\, more action - *something*\\, but that didn't necessarily make it a bad film. It was an enjoyable ride\\, a bit boring at parts\\, dragged a little bit - but when it finally picked up\\, it did so in a meaningful way. Kylo Ren's character development\\, the introduction to a new perspective of \\\"hope\\\" in the franchise\\, and Rey's internal conflict helped even out the pace of the film and land my final rating at a 4.5\/5. Whilst it could have been better\\, it's certainly not the end of the world as some are making it out to be\\, and it leaves room to grow in Episode IX.","true":true}
