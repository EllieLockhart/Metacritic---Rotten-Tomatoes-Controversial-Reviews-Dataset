Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should be called Star Wars Episode VIII: Bombs in Space. Yes\\, that's a double entendre. Early in the movie they literally drop bombs in space. A feat that still leaves me wondering how one goes about dropping anything while in space. That's basically the high water mark for this film\\, because it's all downhill from there. The movie goes through a bunch of pointless side plots where it's reconfirmed that Rey is still the Mariest Sue to ever Mary Sue\\, and all the other characters are still as unimportant as ever. At one point\\, Leia sends out a distress call to the entire galaxy\\, and nobody can be bothered to respond. This is an apt metaphor for the current state of the Star Wars franchise. Disney has crapped all over the lore and canon of Star Wars to the point that most fans will probably sit out the next movie.","true":true}
