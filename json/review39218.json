Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film did NOT honor the saga's rich legacy. Rian Johnson did his utmost best to dishonor it\\, as well as undermine the rich plot development that J.J. Abrams carefully set up in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nAlthough Disney\/Lucasfilm claims to support strong women's roles\\, Rian went out of his way to direct scenes that portray women making disasterous leadership decisions\\, with one even having to [SPOILER] sacrifice herself to fix things\\, and another thwarting a potentially last ditch effort to save lives just to tell a guy she loved him.\\n\\nAs for the ridiculous? Rian Johnson couldn't even remember where Kylo Ren's scar was in Force Awakens. It's moved around his nose on his face from the last film to this one like a joke.\\n\\nRian also included a scene from Hardware Wars ... again\\, as a joke.\\n\\nA joke is how Rian treated Star Wars\\, and how I expect he will treat any future trilogy he is allowed to direct.","true":true}
