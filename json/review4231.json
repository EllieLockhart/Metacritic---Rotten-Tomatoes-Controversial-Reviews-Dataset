Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst of the entire saga. The prequels have their problems sure but they don't shit all over characters that had great story arcs. All the growth and learning from the original trilogy is gone and replaced with hollow heroes and story. This movie is full of pointless scenes\\, characters and some profoundly dumb and intelligent insulting moments. How this gets compared to empire strikes back or even the dark knight is beyond me. I have no idea what movie the critics watched but it wasn't this one. Not only disappointing on every level but it's just a bad movie too. Disney ruined Star Wars more than George Lucas ever did","true":true}
