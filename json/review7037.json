Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easy the worst star wars movie.Yes the prequels has worse acting\\,but that's all they got on this movie.The story was awful\\,now i do not care what happens in this universe\\,or what with the characters.Do not wast your time on this.","true":true}
