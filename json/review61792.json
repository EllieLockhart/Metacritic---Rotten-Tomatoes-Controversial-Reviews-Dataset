However\\, I was left pissed off by the direction of the story\\, the agenda-pushing and SJW BS Neil Druckmann thought was the right thing to do. Everything felt just so unnecessary\\, ultra-violence portrayed felt unneeded and overdramatic. Major characters lack depth and development throughout and at best they often act out of character and at worst they are shallow and boring.\r\rThe gameplay is pretty much the same as the first game with very minor tweaks and the only redeeming qualities have been ruined by Neil Druckman and the involvement of Anita Sarkeesian. TLOU2 do not deserve your money. Naughty Dog do not deserve your money.\r\rThe story of Ellie and Joel already concluded in the first game so why don't you buy Ghost of Tsushima instead?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
