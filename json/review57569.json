Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star Wars film ever made. The movie was the most poorly written\\, political propoganda ridden\\, piece of filth ever. Rian Johnson and Kathy Kennedy are ruining the Star Wars saga with their shitty story telling on political agendas. They ruined Luke (and Leia!). They gave us Jake Skywalker\\, not Luke. Rey was a Mary Sue (still). The plot choices were outright stupid. Rose and Finn story line was pointless trash. They basically had no respect whatsoever for anything that came before it. Killing ackbar off screen? Off screen\\, lucasfilm reps often insult the fan base as being racist and sexist. I didn't think they could release a film that made Force Awakens look good\\, but they did. This was the worst piece of garbage ever made. I will not be seeing \\\"Solo\\\". Disney should fire Kathy Kennedy and not allow Rian Johnson to make another Star Wars film. Going in\\, this film had so much potential and they just squandered it all. Complete trash.","true":true}
