Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect by any means. But I really liked this movie in its own individual place. Just not sure how well it will segue with the trilogy since I'm not really sure what they will do with the next film. \\n\\nBut as its own Star Wars movie\\, Rian Johnson (suitably) kills it. The action and acting were on point. The Kylo and Rey fight sequence was worth the price of admission alone. Interested to see what happens next!","true":true}
