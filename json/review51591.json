Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A daring\\, emotional and powerful blockbuster to be reckoned with! Episode VIII has everything that I can ask from a Star Wars movie and more. It's not quite perfect and some of its many twists will bitterly divide fans but I can't help but be captivated by its thoughtful storytelling\\, imaginative world-building and jaw-dropping spectacle. Completely floored me!","true":true}
