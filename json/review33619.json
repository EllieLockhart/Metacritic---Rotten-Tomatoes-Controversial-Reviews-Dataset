Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. Just Awful.  Kathleen Kenedy and her lapdog\\, Rian Johnson produced a film that took its pants down and defecated on 40 years of fond memories for countless people. After this train wreck of a movie\\, and for the first time ever\\, I no longer care about what happens to the Star Wars universe moving forward. Last Jedi (Over 40) indeed.","true":true}
