Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If your a real fan of Star Wars Disney has thrown in the trash any interest in providing any backstory or lore that has keep us as fans engaged all these years.","true":true}
