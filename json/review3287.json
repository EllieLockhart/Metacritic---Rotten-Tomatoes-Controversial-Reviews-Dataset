Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a huge star wars fan since I was a little kid. This is not star wars. It's political based agenda and feminized characters are noticeable right off the bat. The storyline is shit and there isn't even a lightsaber battle.....in 3 hour star wars movie??. Disney disgraced the franchise and that bitch that produced it should never be let near another star wars production. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME PEOPLE.","true":true}
