Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply awful. Odd character development for the new\\, poor treatment of the old. Strange humor\\, massive plot holes. The choices made to address the burning questions from the force awakens were narratively and emotionally terrible. Did nothing to address the scale problem of the first movie. If the First Order is strong enough to take over the \u201cgalaxy\u201d (I\u2019ll assume a small one) you\u2019re still talking about a military apparatus with billions of people. If your resistance effort is down to the 400 or so people left on a ship\\, then forget about it\\, the war is over. Cinematography was spectacular\\, so it had that going for it. ","true":true}
