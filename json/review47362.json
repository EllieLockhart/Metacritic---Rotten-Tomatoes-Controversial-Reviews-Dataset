Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can i say that has not already been said...  Total crap movie.  All they had to do is change up a few things... give Lea a nice send off and Luke a proper send off.. well actually no.. they had to do a lot more than that.  so many things wrong.. Hated it and the more i think about it the more i hate it.","true":true}
