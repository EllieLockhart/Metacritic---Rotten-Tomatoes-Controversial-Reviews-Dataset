Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not good. It was boring to watch feminism\\, animal rights\\, vegetarianism\\, forced culture diversity\\, sjw crap as well as porg.. Rebels run away\\, keep running... Still on the run aaaaaand yea. Thats alI really remember. Im just gonna not buy episode 7 -9. Just gonna keep it 1-6 and rogue one. I have no hope for 7-9. Rip Starwars. Micky mouse has brought the bubonic plague upon the universe.","true":true}
