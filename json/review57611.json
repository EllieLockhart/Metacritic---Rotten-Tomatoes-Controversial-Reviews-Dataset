Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually impressive\\, with some well done action scenes\\, but the plot is just terrible. The entire movie is just the rebels fleeing from the first order. And when it's trying to be something else\\, the plot only works because of 2 characters not communicating. EVerything in this movie just feels wasted and wrong. Especially what disney have done with the humor\\, tone and characters. Luke\\, Snoke\\, Phasma every character feels so wasted. And there are scenes in this film that does not work at all. For example the casino stuff. But there are good things in this movie\\, the visuals\\, the action and the relationship of Rey and Kylo. But overall very frustrating movie.","true":true}
