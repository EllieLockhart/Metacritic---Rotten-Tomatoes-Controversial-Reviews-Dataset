{"101487":140508,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-04-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It has taken me a few months but I really wanted to wait until the Last Jedi came out on DVD before I mentioned my words to express how much I disliked this movie. How do you take the most hopeful\\, energetic and inspiring person in the Star Wars Saga and completely destroy each and every one of those traits by turning him into a bumbling fool??? We'll anyways. I knew from the terrible opening scene with Poe taking on a DREADNAUGHT\\, A FRIGGIN DREADNAUGHT! Against one X Wing\\, What\\, how? Again\\, whatever? Leia...flying\\, in space...I actually laughed out loud. The infamous standing on a cliff scene. When he tossed that saber over his shoulder it was the first time I thought to myself \\\" If this is what Disney is going to do with this epic saga\\, I want nothing to do with it.\\nThen there are many\\, MANY scenes that I just don't want to relive. Canto Bite (Waste) Fins character (Wasted) New Asian actress\\, unnecessary...New Vice Admiral was completely unnecessary. The Island giant booby milk monster\\, What the Hell? \\nThe space chase in slow-mo\\, Rian Johnson\\, You Suck!\\n\\nLUKE DIES...After\\, not sacrificing anything to help his sister. He knew he was only a projection and could not really get hurt. Hero\\, that's not being a hero. Then he fades away and so did my love for Star Wars. Dammit...Rian Jonson\\, You Suck and so did The Last Jedi!","true":true}
