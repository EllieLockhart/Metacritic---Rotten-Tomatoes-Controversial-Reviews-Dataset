Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi was the biggest disappointment of my movie going life. It ruined everything that was good about the force awakens. This movie is only fit for toddlers and casual fans who have zero investment in the story franchise.","true":true}
