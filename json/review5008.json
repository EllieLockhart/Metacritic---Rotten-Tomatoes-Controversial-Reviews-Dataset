Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couple of scenes I didn't like\\, couple of things I didn't like as a fan\\, despite wishing couple of things didn't happen during the film and wishing couple of things did happen during the film I can't give it less than 5 stars.  it is as good or better than any other star wars film. I don't know why people are trying to sabotage the star ratings for what was a great film. I do know why but without spoilers I can't go into it lol","true":true}
