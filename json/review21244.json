Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wish I could get my money and time back. As a fan of Star Wars I have come to expect story lines that are linear and build up to the next film. The only excitement I have for the next movie is whether or not the franchise can be saved from itself. I could care less about any of the remaining characters.","true":true}
