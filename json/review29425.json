Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson either didn't watch TFA or just said screw it. There is no attempt to have any sort of story continuity between the movies. He kills off major characters in order to make room for the new heroes or so that he can avoid an interesting backstory. New characters such as Admiral \\\"Hodor\\\"\\, \\\"The Swindler\\\" from the pointless casino side story\\, and Rose are introduced; and we are given no reason to care about any of them. Juvenile jokes\\, eye-roll inducing one-liners\\, and political\/social statements are worked in at every opportunity. Also\\, Leia can fly...\\n\\nThe entire 150-minute runtime can be summarized as follows: longest\/lamest 5MPH chase scene in cinema history\\, which ends in the same Rebel versus Empire situation we've been in since Episode IV -- except now the entire Resistance can fit aboard the Millenium Falcon. You could skip this movie and nothing changes but for a few forced character deaths. This is the first Star Wars that I wish I could unsee.","true":true}
