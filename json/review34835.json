Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire build up of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) was thrown out the window to create this movie. While it wasn't absolutely terrible it was filled with childish jokes and most of the movie was anti-climatic. While maintaining the beautiful visuals of The Force Awakens and the smooth storytelling of the original trilogy it could not hold up to those amazing films. This film introduced a new depth to all characters but was not used in the right way. Somehow crushing box office records with an opening weekend of $220 million dollars it did not hold up to expectations and will unfortunately not be as successful as The Force Awakens.","true":true}
