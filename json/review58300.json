Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible...\\n\\nI won't lie... visually and auditory\\, this movie was simply beautiful. John Williams does it again and the cinematography was amazing. Unfortunately\\, that's where the beauty ends. \\n\\nThis was one of the biggest messes that I've ever seen in the theater... and for a Star Wars movie\\, it didn't even feel like Star Wars. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy decided to kill off the mythos of the franchise\\, and completely ignore every plot concept that J.J. Abrams developed in The Force Awakens. From beginning to end\\, the movie was filled with plot holes\\, missing subtext\\, terrible script\\, horrible character and relationship development\\, and some of the worst sequences in cinema history\\, filled with forced humor and feminist undertones that are hard to miss. \\n\\nSo many have already expressed the views that I have and share\\, so I'll end it with this:\\n\\nJohnson and Kennedy did a great disservice to the characters that many of us grew up with... and did an even greater disservice to the fans. This was such a disappointment.","true":true}
