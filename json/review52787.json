Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A long time ago in a galaxy very close indeed I was left inspired\\, thrilled and distraught by a movie that felt like more than just a story to me - that was Empire. The problems of three little people amounted to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world. The fate of the galaxy could be shaped by the actions\\, good or bad\\, of a few individuals.  Not many films have higher stakes\\, or loftier themes. Or the potential to be more ridiculous and self important. I guess a lot of people did find it silly\\, but not me\\, I was inspired. I haven't felt that way in a long\\, long time. \\n\\nUntil now. \\n\\nThe Force Awakens was great for reminding me of the characters\\, the lore and flesh of the original trilogy.  A trip to my hometown. With The Last Jedi it is the emotions\\, the guts\\, the intrigue and joy that is resurfacing.  But this is a new journey\\, and I don't know where it's going. I'm excited. I'm invigorated. I'm heartened. \\n\\nThere's a lot to chew over here\\, and it definitely benefits from a second viewing.  But the nourishment from the tasty mouthfuls of great dialogue\\, acting\\, lore extensions\\, character development and philosophy\\, seasoned with some genuine surprises are well worth the occasional gristly lumps. Absolutely delicious.","true":true}
