Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a dense film\\, whose goal is to challenge the things we should expect of a film in the Star Wars franchise. As a buddy has recently said\\, it is a StarvWars film meant for adults. Well done Rian Johnson.","true":true}
