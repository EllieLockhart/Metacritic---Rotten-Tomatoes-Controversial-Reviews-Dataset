Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are certainly some flaws\\, as there are in every movie\\, including all of the Star Wars films\\, but there's a lot to love about this. It was overly criticized by a  toxic part of the Star Wars fanbase and trolls.","true":true}
