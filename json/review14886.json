Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly think this is one of the best films in the series! The hatred I've been seeing is just crazy! I haven't enjoyed a movie like I did this one in a long time. I can agree there were some parts that had me a bit puzzled\\, but it was still a great movie.","true":true}
