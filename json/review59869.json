The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"What can i say\\, i adored the first game. Joel and ellie quickly became my favorite character's due to their bond that grew along the hard journey they took\\, fighting for eachother\\, the joke's they had along the way and their hardships. Last of us 2 **** on this. Not only did they kill joel within 2 hrs of playing\\, they gave him a gruesome death for shock value. I still kept playing though as i still had some kind of hope that it'd get better\\, I was soo so wrong. The ellie half i had so much fun with\\, i seriously thought i'd be playing as ellie the whole time. WRONG. Once they switched me to abby i about quit\\, i was so disgusted by the fact they forced me to play as joel's killer\\, i didn't know how they could do this. Not only was playing as abby i didn't give two ****s about her\\, they go on to force you to beat ellie to a pulp along with dina\\, i was so sick to my stomach\\, they also killed jesse for shock\\, they tryed so hard to paint abby as a decent person but she say's GOOD when ellie tells her dinas pregnant as she's about to slit her throat? WTF IS WRONG WITH ND. After the ellie\/abby fight i just wanted it to end but they kept dragging the game ON AND ON. They than switch you to ellie again\\, she's finally happy with dina and baby boy but deeply broken and suffering of PTSD... Than tommy show's up\\, he degrades ellie to not give up on persuing abby\\, \\\"this make's no fking sense\\\" so ellie decides to later leave. Than more gameplay a small part of abby than ellies trip on finding her again. She finds her and they fight\\, but guess what. Ellie doesnt kill her\\, she let's her go! I get it but than i don't. Abby was half dead and broken that she could of killed her\\, but ellie see's joel and stops right after losing two fingers STILL. At that point i was completely done\\, i get not killing her in a way\\, it'd be low\\, but they did this part for WHAT? so ellie could finally lose everything because she fking did\\, she lost dina and baby boy\\, she lost the only thing she had left of joel due to her finger loss LIKE WTF WAS THE POINT? ND thought they had not destroyed ellie enough?! Fk ND i waited just like everyone else for this when it wasn't a needed sequel and all they did was destroy my beloved character's.. Broke them\\, turned them into evil people that they never were in the first game. All i got from playing this was  depressed feelings and too many tears. Also no i would of been fine with joel dying\\, i knew he'd die eventually from what he had done.. But not like that... The story as well was a fking mess\\, they should of had abby's part first than bring it to the point where she runs into joel and kills him\\, than it switches to ellie.. But they didnt do this.. It was spun around\\, made no sense\\, it was just a fking pathetic joke to play through. Hope ND are happy with how they destroyed last of us 2 and all the first game stood for.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
