Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any argument about this film reinventing anything\\, breaking new ground\\, or being daring gets slapped down by the fact that this is a poorly paced movie with countless glaring plot holes. Rian Johnson said that he wanted to make a story personal to himself\\, but in doing so he forgot that he was making a Star Wars movie. And it's amazing that even with Luke and Leia\\, this movie barely resembles anything Star Wars\\, and that's at the core of this movie's problem.","true":true}
