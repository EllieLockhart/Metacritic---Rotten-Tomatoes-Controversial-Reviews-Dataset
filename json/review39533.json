Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THIS FILM WAS AMAZING!!! OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!!!! This film was an absolute ride! The Last Jedi is everything you love about Star Wars x10! The film was so well written and all the acting was stellar! I felt like I was there! \\n\\nLet's get something straight right now. This is our \\\"last hurrah\\\" with Carrie Fischer and I'm glad this film did her justice in such a strong way because she is an absolute phenom in this film! (you will cry btw) The only people who will dislike this film are pretentious\\, basement dwelling\\, net-nerds who are too miserable to like anything anyway. GO SEE THIS IN THEATERS!!! YOU'LL HATE YOURSELF LATER IF YOU DON'T!!!!\\n\\n-MTFBWY Carrie Fisher","true":true}
