Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had some great scenes but some terrible writing. An endless arc on a casino planet that is pointless and leads absolutely nowhere. The first order spends 18 hours chasing the rebel fleet rather than warping a few star destroyers 30 s ahead and appearing in front of the rebels. After snoke is gone\\, either Rey going bad or Kylo going good would have lead to an amazing movie\\, the writers chose... nothing. Snoke dies and there is no hint as to even who he was. Leia's superman impression. Admiral Ackbar is thrown away for no reason. The high ratings from the 'official' reviews is bizarre.","true":true}
