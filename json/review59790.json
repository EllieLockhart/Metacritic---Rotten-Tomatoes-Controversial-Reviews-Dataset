Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is garbage. It\u2019s a shame because Neil Druckman did an amazing job with Uncharted: 2. But let me do him a favor and give Amy Hennig the credit as she was the real brains and one thing I learned from this game\\, Drunkman\\, and feminism that I can agree with is NEVER give a man credit for a woman\u2019s work. Glad to see Sony investing in the trash fire that is California. I hope you go bankrupt. From Jak and Daxter 3 to this garbage. I have a PS\\, PS2\\, PS3\\, and PS4\\, but the PS5 is the first Sony system I will NEVER own. I\u2019m very pro Japan and anti American companies even as an American\\, but this pc culture Hollywood crap is NOT what ANY American wants to see. If Nintendo starts making more mature games and aqua teen games I will start back with them as I have a switch\\, but it\u2019s PC all the way. And I\u2019ll support Microsoft by buying an MSI computer with Ray tracing. The real XBOX6. Stop pushing a communist agenda in America. Stop Sony or we\u2019ll have to \u201cmess up\u201d your country again if you catch my drift. You support communists in America maybe I\u2019ll support communists in East Asia and buy some nike shoes so the money will fund the Chinese War Machine!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
