Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Quite impressive. Some one really didn\u00b4t watched the old movies. Not even 7!. No respect for the old characters\\, no actions done that makes sense\\, not for their character it self and barely any for the story. They even fucked up the basic rules of the universe. It maybe looks quite nice\\, but even the story it self doesn\u00b4t make any sense...think about what is happening and...in comparison to the older movies...I am speech less how someone is able to hurt the entire universe and characters that much...you either start disliking the entire universe or you just start to ignore that this movies exists at all.","true":true}
