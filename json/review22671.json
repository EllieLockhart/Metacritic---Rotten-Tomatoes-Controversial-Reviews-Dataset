Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like last year's Rogue One\\, The Last Jedi is a disappointing string of half-baked ideas\\, one-dimensional new characters that crowd the story\\, and questionable shark-jumping ideas.  I can appreciate Rian Johnson's efforts to take the series in an unexpected direction\\, but being different doesn't equate to being a good movie.  Promising mysteries introduced in Force Awakens are summarily dropped.  Character motivations for Rey and Finn become muddled to the point that you don't understand why they're continuing to act as the heroes in this story.  Entire scenes are lifted almost beat-for-beat from both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Cute creatures are introduced in the film for no conceivable purpose other than to sell toys.  Worst of all\\, the story reaches a point by the end of the film where I'm not interested in knowing what happens next.\\n\\nI was informed that it takes multiple viewings to appreciate this film\\, but I've seen it twice and found the aforementioned problems to be more glaring and noticeable the second time around.  The Last Jedi is not without some redeeming qualities - there are some beautiful visuals and a few memorable lines of dialog - but the film as a whole leaves me questioning whether Disney knows what they're doing with this franchise.","true":true}
