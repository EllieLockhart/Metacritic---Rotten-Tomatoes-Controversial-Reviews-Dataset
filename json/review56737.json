Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie makers are really good and cherry picking the images and scenes that remind us of the original three films. But they fail to tell the small story and imply a larger story. There are great moments that tug and the heart and give massage the memories of the past experiences. But as I walked out the theater I realized that the story was lacking. These are not difficult stories to tell. THe is Evil and there is good. There are true believers on each side. There are people with questionable pasts who come to a greater purpose than just personal enrichment. There are the development of dynamic characters from both sides the viewers can invest in. There is tragedy and joy and although good does not always prevail in the second act it always wins at the end. To not follow this basic roadmap creates a hot mess. And that is what the last jedi is \\, a hot mess.","true":true}
