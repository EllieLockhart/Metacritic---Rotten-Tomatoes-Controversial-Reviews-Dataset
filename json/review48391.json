Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With all the slap stick poor jokes pulled me out of the movie. How can a high ranking officer in a military be that dumb\\, it seemed more like a 5 year old's cartoon than a serious movie. If this is how Disney is going to do Star Wars.... I am done with it. \\n\\nIt has great effects i just wish they would take it more seriously but after Jarjar and this officer and bird thing\\, i dont think i can watch another one.","true":true}
