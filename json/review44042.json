Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ failed as a film for me simply because it took what made the original films and even the prequels a faithful story about the Skywalker journey and crapped on it simply to pass the baton. It was the equivalent of turning Mickey Mouse into a serial killer simply because it was different. Luke lost a hand and took a force lightning beating but still had hope to save his father and friends and protect his sister. Obi was lost the Jedi order\\, his friend and padawan and still had hope that Luke might prevail. I didn\u2019t buy the plot device that Luke would so easily flip his script simply from a bad vibe about his nephew\\, and if that was truly the cause then the story failed to sell the intensity of that moment as the catalyst. Solo and rogue one worked for me because they didn\u2019t need to crap on what I knew in order to be independent. If the only way to have Rey\\, Poe and Finn be successful is to diminish what got you here\\, then the story will fail. Lastly the chase theme was a goofy and the Hyperspace ending was simply a waste. It was lazy story telling.","true":true}
