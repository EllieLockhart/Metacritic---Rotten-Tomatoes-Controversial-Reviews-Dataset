Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best movie since Empire! Doesn't deserve all the hate. Taking the franchise in risky new directions was the right thing to do and has caused a lot of controversy. The audience score is due to trolls review bombing the  movie and saying things like\\, \\\"FUCK YOU! DISNEY RAPED AND KILLED STAR WARS!\\\"","true":true}
