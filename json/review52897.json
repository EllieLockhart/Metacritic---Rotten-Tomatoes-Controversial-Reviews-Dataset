Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"alright so I've waited 2 years almost to post my thoughts on this movie and It's probably my favorite out of the new trilogy. But I've had a bit of a complicated relationship with this film.The first time I saw it in theaters I loved it. I loved it so much I saw it 3 times in theaters (2 more viewings than the force awakens or rise of skywalker) But as time went on I let people convince me it was a terrible film and I began to bash on it too. I didn't even watch it for almost a year. But I recently gave it a rewatch and.... I loved it. It's hard to explain. I noticed it's flaws and I see why people don't like it but it's telling a new story. A story that feels like it needs to be told. The best parts of the story though are Luke\\, Rey and Kylo Ren. Luke's story continues through the film and contrary to popular belief this is in his character. He almost killed vader when he threatened Leia and Han. But I'm not gonna try and change your mind I'm just putting my opinion out there. This movie is bold\\,inventive and created an interesting and beautiful story that deserves more love.","true":true}
