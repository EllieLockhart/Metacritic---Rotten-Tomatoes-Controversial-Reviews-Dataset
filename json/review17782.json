Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels like a kids' disney movie and I don't mean that in a good way. There are some ridiculous scenes\\, pointless plotlines\\, and things that defy the reality of what the rest of the series has been built around up until this point. Really not a fan Ewww.","true":true}
