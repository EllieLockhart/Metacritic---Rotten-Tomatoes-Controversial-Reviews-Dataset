Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, the director should have seen the previous movie\\, ya know\\, to understand the personalities of the characters that he inherited. Sure\\, Poe is a damn good pilot\\, but he is not some loose cannon that would cause a mutiny of all things. Luke dies\\, but Leia lives? Hello jackass! Carrie is dead! \\n\\nTo some it up: I thought the Force Awakens was bad\\, until this abomination. Screwed the pooch!","true":true}
