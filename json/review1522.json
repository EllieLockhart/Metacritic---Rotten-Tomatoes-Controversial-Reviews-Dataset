Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan from the very beginning I was prepared to be disappointed having read some of the audience reviews\\, however disappointed I was not. Loved it as did my other half and other friends I have spoken to (with the exception of 1 who wasn't so keen). Cannot wait for the final one.","true":true}
