{"101487":111259,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Brilliant. Exquisitely emotional. Complex. Beautiful. Visually stunning. Narratively powerful. I can't say enough good things about The Last Jedi. For me\\, the movie held up a mirror to all the ways that I struggle and fail in my relationships. As a mother. As a partner. As a daughter. As a sister. As a friend. It triggered deep emotional reactions in me\\, not just as a 30-year fan of Star Wars - a thing that got me through some of the hardest periods of my life - not just as a Reylo shipper\\, but as a human\\, a person. Being confronted with that is going to make people have one of two reactions - they're either going to be impressed with the power of art to trigger those feelings\\, and let themselves feel it\\, or they're going to say \\\"nope. don't want that. Don't want it in general\\, and certainly don't want it from a Star Wars film.\\\" And look\\, I understand the people who are saying it didn't feel like Star Wars to them - I disagree\\, but I can understand and sympathize. The thing is\\, Star Wars doesn't belong to us. Just like Luke tells Rey that the Force doesn't belong to the Jedi. It has to grow\\, it has to evolve - and we can all disagree about how the filmmakers choose to make it grow and evolve. For me\\, it was right. For me it felt powerful\\, justified\\, earned. I can't begin to explain how much the development of Rey and Kylo Ren and their relationship meant\\, how satisfied I was with the growth of Leia and Luke\\, the growth of Poe\\, Finn and the introduction of such wonderful characters as Rose and Holdo. I am NOT going to tell anyone who disliked it that they just \\\"don't get it\\\" or aren't \\\"real Star Wars fans\\\" because that's just silly. I will continue\\, however\\, to evangelize that on repeated viewings and analysis - I could link you to beautiful essays all day long - it continues to rise in my estimation\\, just like TFA did. THANK YOU RIAN and Lucasfilm and JJ and Kathleen.","true":true}
