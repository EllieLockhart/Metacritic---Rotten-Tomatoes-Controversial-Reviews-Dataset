Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie has nothing to do with the Skywalker Saga set up by George Lucas. It is taking a dump on the legacy of George Lucas franchise\\, Star Wars. Imagine if JK Rowling sold Harry Potter to Universal Studios and made Harry Potter a woman who doesn't need to learn magic or The Wizarding School. People would be outraged. that's how I feel about these Trilogy sequel movies.","true":true}
