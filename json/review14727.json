Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have NO idea how the audience score on this is so low. As I was walking out of the theater besides being consumed with thoughts of the events and characters\\, I was already thinking about when I could get back to see it again- something I almost never do. The characters were beautifully human\\, and as their relationships developed and unfolded\\, their deeper stories became visible. There was nuance\\, maturity\\, and electricity in this film that I have never seen matched in a previous episode of SW. I loved this movie and will probably buy it - again\\, something I never do.","true":true}
