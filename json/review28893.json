Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really blown away by this fantastic film. It took what was good and true about the original movies\\, and just expanded on it in every way possible in the BEST way possible. Luke Skywalker has risen to be the legendary Jedi Master we always knew he would be. The villain in this movie... no spoilers here but he is hands down the most evil character we have seen in Star Wars thus far. 10\/10 would see this again and I can't wait to see it on my shelf right next to all the other Star Wars films in my collection. Best of all\\, now I have a classic of my own generation that I can share and watch with my children.","true":true}
