Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I grew up on the original trilogy\\, with the first 2 and maybe 30 minutes into the 3rd one holding a place in my heart forever. But these new installments? I practically slept through the Hayden\/Natalie films\\, and somewhat enjoyed The Force Awakens and now The Last Jedi; didn't bother with Rogue One but I'm skeptically hyped about Solo.  Anyway\\, similar to my experience with The Force Awakens\\, I'm basically tolerating the films now\\, especially the dialogue\\, though there are moments that definitely move and excite me. Still worth the price of admission for a little while longer.","true":true}
