Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Picking up right where J.J. Abrams excellent The Force Awakens left off\\, writer\/director Rian Johnson\u2019s Star Wars: The Last Jedi shows there is still a lot of power left in the Force for this 40-year old blockbuster film series and all around cultural phenomenon. Johnson gives us everything\u2019s we\u2019ve come to expect from a memorable entry in the venerable space saga: lots of razzle-dazzle action\\, a visually spectacular production design\\, incredible special effects\\, emotional twists and turns\\, and\\, of course\\, smart aleck robots and adorable space creatures. What elevates The Last Jedi to a special place in the Star Wars pantheon is the film\u2019s big heart and sense of hope. Our heroes from the Force Awakens are in some pretty dire situations as the film opens: Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and General Leia Organa (the last Carrie Fisher\\, for whom the film is dedicated to)\\, and the crew of their Rebellion spaceship\\, are fighting a losing battle with a giant First Order Destroyer; former First Order Stormtrooper\/now Rebellion fighter Finn (John Boyega)\\, lovable droid BB-8\\, and newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) are off on a dire mission to help rescue Poe and Leia; and poor Rey (Daisy Ridley) is stuck on an island trying to convince the unwilling Jedi Master\\, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)\\, to train her in the ways of the Jedi and the Force. Luke is lightsaber shy with Rey because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s the one who ruined his nephew Ben Solo\\, now Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)\\, son of sister Leia and his deceased best friend\\, Han\\, and now certified member of the dark side\\, thanks to Luke\u2019s botched job of Jedi training. Of course\\, murdering your own Father doesn\u2019t help. Even though Luke is reunited with Chewbacca\\, Rey\u2019s escort\\, R2-D2\\, and the Millennium Falcon\\, he seems less than nostalgic for his glory days and more about being left alone on his super secret Jedi island\\, full of precious little porgs (the new and improved Ewoks!)\\, to take the time to train the impatient Rey\\, who is being psychically harassed by Kylo to give in to the dark side too. There\u2019s lots of drama and life-or-death moments for our beloved characters in The Last Jedi\\, but even in their worse moments\\, Johnson\u2019s screenplay shows there is always hope. The world\\, um\\, galaxy might be on the verge of absolute disaster from being taken over by evil space nazis\\, and we\u2019re all going to die\\, but with hope\\, and maybe a few Jedi mind tricks\\, the heroes can prevail. By sneaking in some social commentary reflecting the world we live in today\\, not to mention the gravitas of seeing the beloved Fisher for the last time as Leia\\, Johnson delivers a fresh and often moving space opera\\, a pretty neat trick\\, Jedi or not\\, for the 8th entry in a film series. Hamill and Fisher\\, reprising their iconic roles\\, are the best they\u2019ve ever been in a Star Wars movie; I defy you fans to not tear up when they finally reunite. In fact\\, all the characters have a little more depth this time around\\, maybe more so than in past entries\\, thanks to the various mortal fears they face in The Last Jedi\\, the rare blockbuster that is as emotional as it is exciting.","true":true}
