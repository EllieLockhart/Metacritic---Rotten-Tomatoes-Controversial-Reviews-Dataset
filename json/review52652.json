Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All of the negative reviews previously posted are spot on.  While the GFX group does their thing\\, the writing and directorial end did not.  This mess was a Lone Starr appearance away from a Spaceballs sequel.  the TONE is all wrong and the jokes are just cringe worthy.  It's ghostbusters-esque in execution and like the ghostbusters reboot\\, spits in the faces of those of us who kept this franchise going.  It's a sad state of affairs in SW land.","true":true}
