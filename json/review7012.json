Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst star wars film made excluding phantom menace. \\nRian Johnson has turned a potential and rich universe of star wars into an simplified childs adventure. Almost every single interesting storyline we were left waiting after force awakens has been ruined Or dropped In this film.  \\nThe half a star im giving is representing the hope I have for J. J. Abrams to fix all the major plot hole and to give the final saga and its characters the proper ending they deserve.","true":true}
