Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having grown up on the original Star Wars trilogy\\, any new movie is pretty high on my expectations list\\, so I won't waste any more time burying the lead. The Last Jedi is easily the best Star Wars movie to come out in my lifetime\\, and it's because of changes to Luke Skywalker. It's well understood the original three films changed the scope of cinema and movies forever\\, but that was 40 years ago\\, and Star Wars can't fall back on the same tired tricks. The Last Jedi represents a willingness to take risks and allow filmmakers to have a vision and follow it though. Disney (who owns Star Wars\\, and Marvel\\, and Pixar\\, etc.) essentially have a license to print money. Year in and year out they consistently hold the highest market share of domestic box office\\, and if things continue as planned and Disney successfully purchases 20th Century Fox\\, they will be almost impossible to beat. That's why it's exciting that they've shown a willingness to take chances and place their faith in storytellers.  Things like Game of Thrones have ended the days of paint by number archetypal characters. I appreciate that Kylo is conflicted. As iconic as Vader is\\, Star Wars doesn't need another one.  Not to mention the joy I felt listening to my 10-year-old talk about the movie and hear her excitement when she said: \\\"You know\\, The Last Jedi. . .  is a Girl!!\\\" Worth the price of admission right there.","true":true}
