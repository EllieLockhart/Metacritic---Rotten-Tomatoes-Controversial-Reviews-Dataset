Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Been a Star Wars Fan my whole life but this moving is terrible.  No thought in character progress or engagement.  I'll probably just wait till the new movies are free to watch which is what i did for Solo.  This movie was just a let down.","true":true}
