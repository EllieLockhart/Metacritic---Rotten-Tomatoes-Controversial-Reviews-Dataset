Both the gameplay AND STORY are compelling.  Some of the action sequences rank among the most thrilling for any game I've ever played -- my heart was pounding so hard I thought it would explode in some parts of the game.  The characters' motivations make sense in the world where they live.  If you take time to explore\\, you discover some quiet emotional beats that are heartfelt.  The character interactions feel real.  And of course the character models and world design are top notch\\, but that's to be expected from a Naughty Dog game.  I feel like the naysayers have prejudged their opinions based on the spoilers\\, which I suppose don't look great when you take them out of context.  When you put the story in the context of this 30-or-so hour game\\, it's directed so that it connects well. And for all those riled up about so-called SJW issues\\, I kept looking for that but if it's there\\, it's not in your face\\, and isn't what this game is about.  The characters feel real and what happens in the world feels natural and expected.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
