Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To many plot holes\\, forced character diversity\\, useless setup from the force\\, too slow\\, too long\\, the movie tries EXTREMELY hard to be funny\\, they went out of their way to ruin everything that was enjoyable about Star Wars\\, leia becomes a god\\, oh and yeah if u watched the force awakens u wasted ur time. Also if u thought u knew Luke's character and thought he was patient and understanding well then **** u. Followed by more SJW bs and plot holes. Absolutely disgraceful to say this was a Star Wars.","true":true}
