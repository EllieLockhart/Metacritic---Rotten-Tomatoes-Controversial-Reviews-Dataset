Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was with this movie. The way characters have been treated in this new trilogy and really sad and this movie completely disrespects them. I get moving on to new characters but at least give the old ones worthwhile passings. That's unfortunately only the tip of the iceberg when addressing the problems with this movie.\\n\\nPlot holes are almost without end in his this movie with many situations being such obvious lazy writing that you wonder how this script got green-lighted. The build-ups from the last movie are never even payed off in any meaningful way. Extremely disappointed with the direction things are going.","true":true}
