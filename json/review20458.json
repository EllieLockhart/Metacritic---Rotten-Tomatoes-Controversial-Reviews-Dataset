Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a huge Star Wars fan since I was a kid and it's nice to see that it can still surprise and excite me after all these years. This is a fresh take on Star Wars that breaths new life into the series. Sure\\, there are some world building things that I can nitpick\\, but when it comes to characters and storytelling this movie knocks it out of the park.","true":true}
