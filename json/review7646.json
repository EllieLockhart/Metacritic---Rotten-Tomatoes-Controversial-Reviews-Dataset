Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything the Star Wars franchise needed. Unexpected\\, poignant\\, beautiful. For the first time I genuinely felt the temptation of the dark side\\, and saw and understood the struggle faced by the heroes. It is the most 'Star Wars' of any of the new films\\, featuring many elements that wouldn't have been out of place in the original trilogy\\, while at the same time moving the whole franchise forward into a place it has never been before.Time will tell\\, but I suspect this will become my favourite Star Wars movie of all time (tied with Empire of course).","true":true}
