Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up here because i felt i had to do it. To tell how i feel betrayed by this massacre. SW is no more\\, RJ deconstructed the whole mythology of this fabulous saga\\, sacrificed it in the name of what ? To make it look like so Marvel-like franchise ? SW is NOT a comic movie and has never been...the opening scene of the movie tragically shows us where Disney wants to go with the future of SW : a humorous franchise with no scenario\\, generic heroes and non-sense scenes where force is compared to yoga....i really hope some petition will be made and massively signed to kick out RJ out of the SW saga...This guys just crushed the Jedi like no other Sith had done before.
