Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WOW this movie really sucked makes the prequels look awesome ...and I don't understand the rotten tomatoes score of 91% really just goes to show you they are not fans and don't get it at all ","true":true}
