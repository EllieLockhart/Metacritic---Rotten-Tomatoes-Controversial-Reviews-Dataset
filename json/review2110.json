Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As thoughtful as the Force Awakens was full of heart\\, this entry may strike some viewers as 'too' unexpected upon first viewing\\, but the care and rationale behind every decision is clear upon a second viewing. Rian Johnson has created an emotionally resonant\\, character-driven drama for the second act of this new trilogy\\, with enough of balletic space action sequences audience members expect. I think despite initial audience reaction\\, this film will be seen in time as being one of the greatest chapters in the SW saga.","true":true}
