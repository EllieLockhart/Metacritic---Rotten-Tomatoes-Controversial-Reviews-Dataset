{"101487":134346,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just saw TLJ and thank you Disney for turning the Star Wars franchise into \\\"The Bachelor\\\" outerspace edition. Kylo: \\\"Rey\\, will you accept this rose?\\\" ?? There are better plot twists on message boards and YouTube. Would someone please explain to me like I'm a 6 yr old\\, what was the point of Snoke? He's telepathic\\, can see Kylo's thoughts\\, but isn't clairvoyant enough to see that he's about to be cut in half? In a word\\, retarded! And what the fuck is it with this \\\"be a Jedi in three easy steps\\\" bullshit? It's harder to make a Chia pet it would seem. And Disney actually gave Rian Johnson the reins to create a new trilogy! Hollywood must be bereft of writing talent. It's not hard to see how JJ Abrams was the man who started this hot mess with episode seven because I am truly \\\"Lost\\\" at where the writing team is trying to take this franchise. You're making George Lucas's writing of the prequels seem Shakespearean by comparison. Disney has ruined all the original characters - ffs they even made poor Chewbacca a vegetarian! Oh and Luke dies from boredom\/stress? Mark Hamill was right to be mad at the direction Disney (has anyone in the production team actually seen the movies?!?) took his character. It is time for the Jedi to end.","true":true}
