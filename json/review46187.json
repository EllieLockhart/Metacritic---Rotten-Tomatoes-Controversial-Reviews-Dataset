Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Walked out of the theatre disappointed and confused as to why they some people loved this movie. Treated most of the main characters like crap\\, pointless storylines\\, and focused too much on the antagonist. \\n\\nNot a movie that I would want to watch over and over. There were some good parts\\, but they are overshadowed by the bad parts.","true":true}
