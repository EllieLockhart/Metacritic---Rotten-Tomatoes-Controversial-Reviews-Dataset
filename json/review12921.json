Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dislike this movie fundamentally & to the core.\\nI am a die- hard SW fan (movies\\, books\\, games\\, lore\\, history\\, THE EU\\, etc.) & have been for 20 yrs. I did like aspects of the movie\\, but very few. It was an alrite movie\\, but not a \\\"STAR WARS\\\" movie.\\nI had problems w Luke\\, on basically everything\\,\\nLeia can apparently fly now (w no training btw)\\,\\nI guess Rey needs 3 meditation sessions and she's now a super powerful Jedi master?\\,\\nSnoke. Really? Wat was the point of this guy at all?\\nDidn't even Need Rose. Wudnt all the time w rose been better if finn had to hook up w LANDO instead?\\nLuke no action fites\\,I guess we dont need the here saber either? \\nPhasma mite b the most underused awesome character\\, ever\\,\\nThe humor fell flat for me\\n\\nIf Disney let all this humor go into this movie\\, then Lord and Miller must have making a monty python version of the Han movie for them to have gotten fired!\\n\\nMy screen is messed up and I can't get back to the bottom of my screen here so I gotta put the ending to this post rite here:\\n(Plz go to bottom after this section to see wat I liked about TLJ)\\n\\nI am a fan of the old movies (who isnt?)\\, but i think they r destroying wat the FORCE was\\, the mystique\\, the training necessary\\, etc. Also\\, they could have done soooo much different things\\, better things with Luke. Ur telling me that a man who throughout everything had HOPE in the rebellion\\, in DARTH VADER! Who was a mass- murdering\\, unredeemable\\, evil person. He never gave up HOPE and stared down the Emperor\\, bc he believed and HOPEDhis father would turn good and save him..... was gun a kill Ben\\, even for a second\\, cuz he saw wat he \\\"mite\\\" b capable of??? Come on!!!\\n\\nAgain\\, I love SW w all my heart\\, but I think Disney is killing the STAR WARS THAT I LOVE.\\n\\n\\nI did like all of kylo and how he was\\,\\nAll of yoda. I mean\\, that way cool!\\nRey\/kylo scenes\\, relationship and fire w the guards\\nLuke\/rey relationship\\,\\nThe music score & cinematography was incredible\\,\\nKickbacks to previous films\\,\\nThe hubris of the old Jed order. (Awesome. I always Thot that too)\\,\\nSnokes scenes b4 he does\\nAnd the lightspeed suicide scene was phenomenal","true":true}
