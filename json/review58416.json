Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fundamentally broken film that boasts stunning visuals\\, a peppering of great action and a few scenes of tense drama but ultimately requires audiences with any prior knowledge of the Star Wars universe to disengage their brains completely. The film's treatment of legacy characters comes off as disrespectful to long time fans and yet it also fails to deliver any compelling character development for the new roster outside of the main antagonist. Established plot points and mystery set up in J.J. Abram's The Force Awakens are squandered for the sake of shock value and the film compromises the integrity of its characters to hold together it's flimsy plot. In The Last Jedi's few moments of brilliance\\, it is on par with what audiences have seen in the Original Trilogy. In between those few moments of greatness\\, The Last Jedi struggles to gain a leg up over any of the films in the Prequel Trilogy.","true":true}
