Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason TLJ gets two stars from me is because visually it is beautiful. Rian Johnson knows what he is doing behind the camera. Behind the script\\, not so much. Upon my first viewing of this film I came away feeling confused and dissatisfied. There were many scenes that bothered me but I couldn't quite tell you why. I've since seen it three more times and I can now say with confidence that TLJ is plot hole city. There are writing errors through out that are tough to detect but once you start to see them they become glaringly obvious. I wanted to like this film so much; but I am afraid that all it did for me is drag my opinion of it's predecessor The Force Awakens down with it. The films are supposed to be connected but Rian seemingly decided to throw the baby out with the bath water and do his own thing. Being a Star Wars fan since I was a child in the early 80's this is the first Star Wars film that I did not have an over all good time watching; including the prequels.","true":true}
