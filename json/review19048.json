Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's fine as an action movie.  It's awful as a Star Wars movie.  Absolutely no character development.  No answers or concerns about important characters history or connection to the story\\, making them well\\, not so important.  The anticlimactic end for Luke is nonsense.  And how on earth do you make a Star Wars movie where Luke Skywalker finally returns and not include him in a lightsaber fight?  No wonder episode 1 and Jar Jar Binks have a higher rating.","true":true}
