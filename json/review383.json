It is well-worth the anticipation and wait\\, as well as all the trouble it went through in production. It's discordant and lacks true focus in certain instances\\, but it never loses track of what it is or where it's going\\, making it a creepily tantalizing game and story.\r\rConcept: Revel in the atmospheric horrors of a classic slasher film from the comfort of your couch\\, and better yet make the decisions leading to gruesome and sometimes hilarious and well-deserved deaths all the while progressing through an interesting and malleable plot.\r\rGraphics: The visuals\\, the animations\\, and the overall content showcase a fine level of quality and add believability to the resume as well. Yes\\, I probably made that word up.\r\rSound: Both the melodies and the voice work add to the already well designed experience and add a higher sense of tension appropriately where needed.\r\rPlayability: While the majority of gameplay focuses on simplicity\\, that's not to say it isn't still a highly enjoyable and interactive experience.\r\rEntertainment: I hope you like tripping and being cleaved in half by a tottering psychopath\\, because that and even more is in store for you if you choose to play this game.\r\rReplay Value: Moderate.\r\rOverall Score: 8.0\u2026 Expand","true":true}
