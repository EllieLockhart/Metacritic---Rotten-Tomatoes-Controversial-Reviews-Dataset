Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly good looking and well paced. Seriously fun that answers many questions but also opens up a few more. Suspenseful the whole way through\\, unpredictable. This movie is all about making a new path. Uncharted territory in the star wars universe. Can't wait to see what's next.","true":true}
