Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm sad. I was hoping for this movie to be fun and thrilling like the VII but it wasn't.  The cinmetography\\, plot\\, and character development were all great\\, but when it comes down to it\\, star wars is supposed to be fun and this was not nearly as fun.  Granted the movie had some really cool moments\\, but the movie as a whole\\, especially the first half\\, was a little boring.","true":true}
