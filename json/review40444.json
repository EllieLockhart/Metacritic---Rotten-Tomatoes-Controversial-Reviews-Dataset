Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the film that killed Star Wars.  Character destruction (Luke)\\, poor character development (every major character).  Far too much to go into\\, but once you've seen it you'll know why so many fans are up in arms.\\nE9 will be watched once on tv\\, I won't be parting with cash for it.","true":true}
