Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, well\\, well!  Fans are clearly split on this one...  I'm a life-long Star Wars fan and I enjoyed this immensely\\, but it is definitely the most stylistically unique SW movie to date\\, and it opens the door for future SW movies to explore new territory.  Perhaps this is what's upsetting some\\, but I for one am embracing the change.  I'll always enjoy the original trilogy best\\, but you can only mine the same characters and storytelling stiles so many times before it gets stale.  Whether you enjoyed it or not.... relax\\, folks: it is\\, after all\\, just fiction!","true":true}
