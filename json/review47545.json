Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what's that sound i can hear rumbling down the street?.............A BANDWAGON OF 'REDDIT' TYPE SHEEP!!!\\nThis is a cracking watch and just like the previous one and the originals\\, doesn't take itself super serious...unlike the bandwagon bifters on here giving it pelters. Some of the comments on here are just pure comedy gold and i suspect most are Trekkies on the take. Hahaha makes for great reading thuogh\\, so crack on BAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","true":true}
