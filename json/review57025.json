Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film defies the expectations normally associated with a Star Wars film. Where Star Wars traditionally held to a simple plot and trusted well tested tropes\\, this one steps away from that. The plot is complex\\, deals with socio-political issues head on\\, and takes you right to the edge of expected tropes and nopes out at the last second. I enjoyed it immensely and would have given it 5 starts except for the fact that some of the humor seemed oddly placed. Seeing Carrie Fisher on screen did make me ugly cry.","true":true}
