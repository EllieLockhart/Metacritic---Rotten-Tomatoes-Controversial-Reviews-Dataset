Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst movie ever\\, not only did the movie suck but the script sucked\\, I don't know how the reviewers of Rotten tomatoes rated this a 92%.  Once again all reviewers for Rotten tomatoes are being paid by Disney and Marvel.  Cause this movie was horrible.  So now i guess \\\"The Force\\\" has an On\/Off Switch and when chasing other space ships you just have to keep up with them long enough for them to run out of gas.  92%?  Get your head out of your...  This was a zero but I don't think you're allow to give the movie a zero.  Horrible.  Star Wars is truly dead.","true":true}
