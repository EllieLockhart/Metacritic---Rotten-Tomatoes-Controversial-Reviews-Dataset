Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A let-down for star wars fans that feels more like a marvel film than a star wars film. Bad jokes and plot-holes plague this film and it is an insult to people that have been following this series since the original series of episodes 4\\, 5 and 6","true":true}
