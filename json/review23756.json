{"101487":152582,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke Skywalker may as well say to the Disney execs that \\\"this is not going to go the way you think!\\\" and he could very well be talking about what they have done with the Star Wars Franchise.\\nThe Force Awakens was a safe movie. Many believe it had to be a retro movie so as to restore fans after the disappointment of the prequels. They took no risks; recreate Episode IV with a larger Death Star\\, bring in some young brash characters\\, a brand new Emperor-like character and a brand new Darth Vader'ish character. From a financial perspective - you've inherited the keys to a multi-billion dollar business\\, you play it safe\\, you make money first\\, even if that insurance policy removes the risky flair and panache that made the Star Wars the success that it was. \\nThat being said\\, it did tease the viewers with several burning questions: who were Rey's parents\\, who is this Snoke guy and Luke's mysticism at the end left us looking forward to Ep. VIII. TFA did leave us wanting more and created a nice segue to a give Episode VIII a strong opportunity to not only converge all these untold stories\\, but also define where Disney was going to take the franchise.\\nAnd they've totally bombed on it.\\nTo start with\\, there are too many characters. Trying to balance them all out results in juggling too many complicated storylines concurrently. The lack of screen time causes the characters to seem jilted and manufactured into the story. Fanboys will whine: Not enough R2-D2. Not enough C-3P0 as there is a clear battle for screentime between the droids. Chewbacca seems out of place. General Ackbar is outed ingloriously in place of Admiral Holdo who also gets outed (more gloriously). Maz Kanata gets a lucky few minutes as does Lieutenant Connix but all there's just too many minor characters and in case of the first generation cast\\, it does them an injustice.\\nLooking at the bad guys: Captain Phasma could have been a lot more\\, she is reduced to being humbled in the first movie\\, to a dubious fight scene that gives her all of 2 minutes film exposure. General Hux does not have the cool\/calm demeanor that Moff Tarkin did and his power struggle against Kylo Ren is unnecessary. Snoke died without us knowing very little about him\\, it was like Darth Maul all over again. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is one of few redeeming characters in this movie and his tete a tete scenes with Rey give us the most intrigue in the movie.\\nThe good guys are even more messy. For those that grew up with the swashbuckling escapades from the first generation heroes there's nothing but disappointment. Mark Hamill is fantastic as Luke but is this the Luke we imagined 30 years on? The same Luke that abandoned his training and everything the Jedi stood for to recklessly try to save his friends? Film directors have made him despondent\\, frustrating and frankly uninspiring. The death of Carrie Fischer was on the mind of everyone in trying to \\\"guess\\\" when Leia would die\\, it ruined her character. Finn's role seems out of place\\, and the whole trip to the casino doesn't really flow well with the \\\"problem scenario\\\" they're in. Poe becomes an annoyance after being lambasted for his actions and only seems to fit when he's flying a ship. Finally to add to the screen time congestion is another hero in Rose Tico; while her character was commendable\\, there's only so much you can do trying to tell 10 stories at the same time. \\nStar Wars kept it simple; your not-so-typical feisty princess\\, a young exuberant boy being trained by a wily old jedi master\\, a rogue smuggler oozing with charm\\, his side kick Wookie and two droids that are reminiscent of the odd couple. The bad guys were simple too; Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader both had their role and space all being masterminded by the emperor. It was simple. \\nThere are several other flaws in the movie that just didn't need to happen. Leia's Mary Poppin's moment into outer space (come on\\, that's not how the force works). Luke's virtual reality moment half way across the galaxy (come on\\, that's not how the force works). How can Yoda destroy things in the real world from the metaphysical world?  If Kylo can kill the grand master with a sneaky sideways light sabre move\\, surely Yoda can do the same if he's strong enough to destroy the temple. There's no consistency with what the force can do - just more histrionics to add dramatic effect. \\nThere is a purification in Disney movies that make them distinctly noticeable. It's a very simple formula - a character is introduced\\, they're loaded with personality but they have some quirks and as problems unravel around them they hit rock bottom\\, only to find their inner true self\\, overcome obstacles\\, beat the bad guys and we all live happily ever after. It's been done hundreds of times over and has made them a lot of money. The movie sells the themes of starting over\\, poor juxtaposes its characters and does a poor transition from old generation to new. By the end\\, the movie leaves us with the entire rebellion fitting inside the Millennium Falcon (which is what 15?).\\nThere has been a lot of conjecture around how Episode VIII was going to be a different type of Star Wars. That it had to make a lot of difficult decisions in order to evolve in order to move into its next generation. We are now 2\/3's into the new series and there are several problems that Disney have created for themselves.","true":true}
