Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing. Looks like Disney is just trying to feed off us long time Star Wars fans and has no clue what we stuck to. They are just tearing everything of the story apart to make a \\\"made for TV\\\" series they can try to drain on after the 9th movie.\\n\\nThe movie destroyed sith vs jedi battles. Snoke\\, Rey\\, and Finn characters have been ruled pointless. It seems Disney was so concentrating on making a \\\"diverse\\\" film of characters and stories\\, they had no clue what Star Wars films remained so popular for. It's good vs evil\\, jedi vs sith\\, anything else is just Star Trek with droids.\\n\\nI compare this movie and director to the shame of Highlander 2. A story that was ripped apart from the previous story and the writer\\, director and movie series shamed so badly that the extending sequels literally ignored Highlander 2 even existed. #recallStarWars8\\n\\nJ.J.\\, if you wanna save this series for us\\, make number 9 like number 8 never existed. It will show George Lucas and the characters and story he created respect. #starwars8bigdisgrace\\n\\nElsewise\\, we have seen the last of the jedi and the last of the Star Wars story....","true":true}
