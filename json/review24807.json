Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Muy mal escrita. Pesima. La peor pelicula de Star Wars de toda la saga. No tiene sentido lo que sucede aqu\u00ed ni coherencia. No hay trama\\, no hay conflicto\\, no har personajes\\, no hay drama. Evitala.","true":false}
