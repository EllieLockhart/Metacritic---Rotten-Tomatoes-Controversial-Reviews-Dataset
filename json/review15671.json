Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie and so did my whole family.  Just like many critics though\\, I think the middle of the movie was a little dull.  It was one of those movies that in certain parts felt like it was oversaturated with messages and too many characters. The original trilogy had a little more focus and I think that's what people loved. You really felt like you got to know the characters.\\n\\nI honestly thought this movie felt a little bit more like the original trilogy than TFA though which is a big compliment.","true":true}
