Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes no effort to answer any of the questions posed from TFA. It's almost flippant towards fan speculation and theories\\, as if it went out of its way to make fun of them by making some TFA plot points out to be 'nothings'.  Rey's Parentage\\, Snoke's backstory\\, Ren's turn to the dark side are all lazily handled. Luke is handled worst of all\\, and has been completely derailed from his former self. The worst scene for me was Luke  and Yoda\\, which was more nostalgia pandering than anything else\\, deciding it was a good idea to burn ancient Jedi texts. And Yoda can bring lightening down as a ghost? OK. \\n\\nThere's also a lot of Marvel style humor\\, which has no place during the serious backdrop of the movie. Characters with potential were squandered; including Hux\\, Finn\\, Maz Kanata\\, and (especially) Phasma. It seems Rey has power just because\\, and can fight off highly skilled soldiers just because. It makes her feel like a Mary Sue.  Plot holes a plenty. Many things make no sense when broken down\\, and characters that felt shallow and were\\, at times\\, agitating. (Holdo\\, Rose\\, Poe). \\n\\nThis is the worst SW film\\, and one of the most poorly written sequels I've ever seen. Rian took zero regard for what was setup in the TFA and the lore of the SW universe and it shows. Overall\\, it was so pathetic it inspired me to start reviewing films.","true":true}
