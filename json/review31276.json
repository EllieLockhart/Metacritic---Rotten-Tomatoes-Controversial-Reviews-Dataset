Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many wrong things in this film\\, how was the bomber dropping bombs like there\u2019s no gravity\\, or the girl inside the bomber did not die or float away when the doors opened to release the bombs\\, or when laia Superman back on the ship\\, and luke character was just really bad\\, and who\u2019s is snoke? I guess it doesn\u2019t matter because he was killed so easily by an amateur kid. Most of the movie is of rebels fleeing\\, no epic battles just complete garbage film. ","true":true}
