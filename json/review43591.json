Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not a Star Wars movie\\, rather it was a Disney movie that was Star Wars themed. Disney somehow managed to inject the same corny humor and whitewashed tone they put into Marvel movies into this Star Wars movie that's supposed to be set in a far far away galaxy. I actually found Episode 7 rather good (at the very least it felt like Star Wars and was entertaining)\\, but Rian Johnson just destroyed any possibility of a halfway decent trilogy that JJ Abrams could've done all on his own.","true":true}
