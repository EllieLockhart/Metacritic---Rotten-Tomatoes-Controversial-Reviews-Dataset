Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the First Star Wars film that left me stunned and not even giving it a round of applause. Giving the main character to contradict his past is the stupidest thing i have ever seen. Missing plots and characters\\, 100% sexist\\, jokes that aren't even suppose to be on there\\, and no disrespect to Carrie Fisher but wtf was that scene all about? (to the people that seen it) there would have been a better way to give the character a better way to end her part but i found it extremely ridiculous.","true":true}
