Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What character development we got in TFA was backtracked with TLJ. Luke Skywalker felt so out of character\\, and did not feel like the beloved Jedi we have come to know. The major villain was a big let down and so was Phasma. Way too much forced humor with little pay off for developed story lines. The movie wasn't terrible but by no means was it good.","true":true}
