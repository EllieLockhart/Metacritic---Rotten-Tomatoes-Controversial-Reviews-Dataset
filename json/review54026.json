Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can\u2019t believe the bad reviews I\u2019m reading. It\u2019s a movie about galactic space wars. People go in expecting a movie that will win an Oscar. It\u2019s meant to keep you guessing and entertained. If it did that\\, then job done and move on. ","true":true}
