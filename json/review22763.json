Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally the worst movie I have ever seen- the title should have been \\\"Star Wars- The Last Way to Kill a Series\\\"  I am so hurt right now. I go to maybe 3 movies a year...always on Christmas Eve. I've never understood how someone would want to review a movie- but after watching this burning trsah can.  I completely understand. I should have sen Thor like I wanted to\\, but I let the hype for this movie sway me. I would love to sit down and watch this movie as painful as it would be and ask them throughout the movie wtf made them think any of what happened in this movie seemed okay or was worthy of this series. Everything is just wrong.","true":true}
