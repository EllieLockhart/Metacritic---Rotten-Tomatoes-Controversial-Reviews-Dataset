Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the start of the movie when Luke tosses the lightsaber over his shoulder to the unceremonious death of Snoke\\, this movie laughs in your face for thinking you were entitled to the answers to the mysteries set up in the force awakens. You might as well not have watched TFA.","true":true}
