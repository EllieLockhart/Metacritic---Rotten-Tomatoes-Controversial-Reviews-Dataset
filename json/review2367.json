Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At times in my life I have reminisced about the magical times when my best friends and I would play with our Star Wars figurines at recess.  We would pretend Luke or Solo or R2D2 would save the day.  Nothing could stop this alliance and the force from doing what was right.  These are some of the most fond memories I have of my early elementary years.  So obviously it hurts to say I will never get to\\, or now even want to\\, see another Skywalker or Kenobi on screen again.  Rian Johnson basically put an end to that.  And even if he would develop a change of heart\\, there is simply no way to pull this series out of the landfill if he wanted.\\n\\nFrom cheap and untimely jokes.  Not building on characters from the Force Awakens.  Luke milking and alien?  Forcing the conflict going on between Kylo Ren's ears down our throats - for goodness sake let him make a decision already!!  Changing basically everything we knew about the Star Wars Universe.  And worst of all\\, completely ruining pop culture's largest sci-fi character EVER- Luke's Skywalker.  If Rian Johnson's plan was to take down the most popular franchise of all time\\, he succeeded.  \\n\\nI am thankful for my precious memories of Star Wars\\, lightsabers and the Skywalker legacy and will hold on to them forever.  I can assure you\\, there won't be any new ones from this series.","true":true}
