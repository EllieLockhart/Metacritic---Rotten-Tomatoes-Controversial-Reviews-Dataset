Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Happy with the direction Rian Johnson took the mythology of the saga. Something needed to change for Star Wars to remain relevant for years to come. The same story couldn't be told over and over. I understand why some would feel like this movie was a slap in the face to longtime\/hardcore fans\\, but a new take on the universe is needed. The Last Jedi is the start of a new direction and I'm grateful for it.","true":true}
