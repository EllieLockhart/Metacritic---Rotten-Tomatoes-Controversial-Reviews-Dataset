Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a great movie\\, with just 2 decisions that bugged me. \\n1. The admiral Holdo-Poe conflict was silly and inconsequential\\, and could have been avoided if she wasn't written in a way to specifically cause anger and conflict.\\n\\n2. Finn's decision to sacrifice himself should have been followed through. They let down a big character changing monent for Finn. Rose's quote in this scene was laughably stupid and cringeworthy.\\n\\nBesides those two points\\, it is a well directed\\, beautifully shot movie that was enjoyable to watch and had great action scenes. I'd watch it again\\, and I can't wait for Episode 9.\\n\\nMy honest review of this movie would be 4 stars out of 5\\, but I want the 5 star review to offset the ridiculous over-analyzing no lifes hating on this movie.","true":true}
