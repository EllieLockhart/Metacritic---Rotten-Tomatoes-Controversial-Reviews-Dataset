Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(3 Stars) Almost two years ago to the day\\, Star Wars was reborn with Episode VII - The Force Awakens.  A year after that\\, Rogue One turned the franchise back in time with a prequel that subverted many expectations for what a Star Wars film SHOULD be about.  Say hello to Rian Johnson\\, director for The Last Jedi\\, and official pot stirrer moving forward.  In just two and a half hours\\, he has completely turned the entire franchise on its head.  Leave your expectations at the door.  This is not the Star Wars you grew up with.  For better and for worse\\, The Last Jedi firmly puts us on a path separate from anything you believed. It sets the franchise off on a new journey\\, which will divide its fan base moving forward.\\n\\nCritics loved this.  The Audience has been mixed.   However\\, I think most of us who grew up with Star Wars (and I say that loosely at the age of 30 considering there are many others who were alive when it came out) are more shocked than upset\\, but perhaps both.   You pick which one more than the other.\\n\\nLet's not forget the second trilogy (Episodes I\\, II & III) tried to introduce new and shiny ideas or concepts while sticking to an overall story line that was already written for it.  This third trilogy does the exact same by introducing new concepts and expanding on well-known models we've come to understand\\, but it doesn't have the burden of following a story that was already preordained.  I think the Audience NEEDED to see something as close to the originals to reboot the franchise when Episode VII came out two years ago.  It sucked everyone back in and gave them a reason to be involved with the universe again.  It looks like Johnson and the other powers that be are ready to write their own story moving forward.\\n\\nI don't know if Johnson was the right choice as director\/writer moving forward\\, but he and any of the other producers\/writers\/officials have burned the bridge tying them to anything from the past; and the movie essentially hammers it into your head you need to forget about any of the rules you believed in from the first six films.  What you thought you knew about the Force...what you think you know about Luke Skywalker...this is a movie designed to lead you into new \\n and uncharted territory with just a smidge of familiarity.  Rey and Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren are officially our new focal points\\, and I believe a lot of people who live and die by the original trilogy are upset at the fact they thought we were getting another Empire Strikes back instead of something completely different.  Johnson has completely zigged when everyone thought he would zag.  He does it nearly a dozen times.  It gives us some cool and fresh moments with our characters\\, but he also misses the mark on a handful of occasions.  \\n\\nI still liked the fact this film had all the emotion and nuances of a Star Wars film.  The environments were top-notch Star Wars.  New ships and new planets were introduced that represented new ideas or light callbacks to former films but with their own specialty.  The sounds are still rich with the wave of a light saber or firing of a laser gun.  The questions we had about Ben Solo and Rey are answered from Episode VII\\, and their story continues to be a focal point moving forward.\\n\\nHowever\\, I did not enjoy the length of the film because of some plot lines that trailed off without any resolution.  It wasn't as tight as it could have been\\, and for many of the new characters (and a few old ones)\\, it just seemed like busy work while the main thread kept chugging along.  The trouble here is Johnson used a handful of those new characters as catalysts to move the plot instead of taking time to make us care about them outside of their actions.   Benicio Del Toro's character deserved much more than he was given while Kelly Marie Tran's Rose received much more of a focus than she should have gotten.  I'm not quite sure where Finn stands in all of this moving forward.  Oscar Isaac's Poe gets fleshed out just a bit more\\, but he still remains a secondary character even in the grand scheme of things at the end of the film despite receiving more work than Ep VII.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver continue to be the best things about the new trilogy.  A lot of there story still hasn't been fully fleshed out\\, but they still make the most sense.  There is a moment when the two of them are talking about the Sith and the Jedi ending\\, and it gets me on the edge of my seat to see if they take that somewhere down the line.\\n\\nBut just like Johnson did away with many of the expectations people had\\, he also targets Leia and Luke as victims of the new regime as we move further away from what we all thought was canon.  Many people will be unhappy with their arcs by the end of the film\\, but when you take into account everything Johnson and his team changed\\, it shouldn't come as a surprise after the fact.\\n\\nThere is so much to write about and so much to talk about\\, and that's what is special about a Star Wars film.  It was the second largest opening of all time (the first was Episode VII).  People still flock to see these films on the name alone\\, but a friend of mine put it best when he said Disney is no longer making Star Wars films.  He's right...in a way.  The bones are still there to keep even the biggest of doubters interested as each new movie comes out\\, but Star Wars has now been sucked into the machine\\, so they've expanded and broadened on stories\\, themes\\, and staples in the universe.  They have officially opened up this universe to everyone when many of us thought you had to be invited into this world or a true Star Wars fan to say the least in order to understand what was happening.  This new vision is sure to upset a lot of the old-school crowd\\, but moving forward\\, this is going to open up an entire new generation to what it means to be a Jedi...if there even are anymore after this film...","true":true}
