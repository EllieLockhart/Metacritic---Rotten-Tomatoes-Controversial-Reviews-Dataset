Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much hands on this movie and you can read some kind of vendetta to the original fans\\, humiliating the original characters and uprising the producer's flag of a personal\/political protest. No hope\\, no space opera\\, is just a mix of trendy ideas. Disney bought the golden goose and the producers and directors just cooked and burned the poor bird.","true":true}
