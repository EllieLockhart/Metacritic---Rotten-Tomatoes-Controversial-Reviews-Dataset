Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total disappointment.  A large part of the plot was pointless\\, the story was flat.  Most of the dramatic scenes were cut short despite the excessive length of the film\\, preventing us from appreciating any of the moments.\\n\\nThe ending could have been done much better in a dozen different ways and still achieved the same result.\\n\\nOverall\\, it was awful.","true":true}
