Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A wonder to behold\\, but not in a good way.\\n\\nThough there wasn't much to go on in the first place\\, so much of the new lore established by episode VII is trampled on or never explained in its sequel (and never really can be at this point)\\, and furthermore\\, iconic characters of the past are often dull and to be blunt\\, just plain badly written.\\n\\nEpisode VIII is a movie with lots of moving parts\\, so much so it's actually impressive it was squeezed into a two and a half hour run time\\, but has almost no guiding \\\"force\\\" and really lacks a soul.\\n\\n---SPOILERS BELOW---\\n\\n----\\n\\n----\\n\\n----\\n\\nJust a few nitpicks. This could go on forever\\, btw.\\n\\nBB8 the coin dispenser? And AT-ST pilot? Why were these even things? Oh\\, and love him plugging electrical problems like they're holes in a leaky ship. Very amusing. (No it wasn't.)\\n\\nLuke was so out of character... I don't even know where to begin. Oh\\, actually I know where. How about that he was willing to kill his nephew because he sensed darkness in him? This is the same guy that wouldn't strike down Vader despite being one of the most evil people in the galaxy\\, but sure\\, he'd consider murdering his nephew in his sleep? You know\\, the child of his best friend and sister? Really\\, that actually crossed his mind?\\n\\nTo continue\\, Luke promises to teach three lessons to explain why a force for good shouldn't exist. These lessons teach absolutely nothing\\, and the reasoning is laughable.\\n\\nOh and Luke asks what's he supposed to do\\, stand up to the First Order and... oh my god\\, this is the guy that's responsible for the destruction of the Death Star TWICE. Seriously he's the poster boy on how awesome the Jedi could be\\, but yeah he isn't sure what he'd do now. I mean helping his sister and standing up to the apprentice he tried to sleep-murder might be a step in the right direction\\, though.\\n\\nFor bonus points\\, let's toss in Luke milking a bird-man-thing then proudly displaying his willingness to drink said milk. Yeah\\, after 30+ years of not seeing Luke Skywalker\\, this is exactly how we want to see the character.\\n\\nFinn and Rose. Yeah\\, this seemed like a natural progression of the characters. Uh.\\n\\nYoda. Everything is wrong about Yoda. He looks terrible. He's acting like he's crazy for some reason. And he shows up just because. And while we're at it\\, thankfully Anakin and Obi-Wan didn't show up too\\, I mean\\, who needs their advice?\\n\\nOne of the first Jedi temples has\\, for some reason\\, a pit linked to the dark side. That is terrible for\\, uh\\, some reason... but it's really just a giant mirror fun house. it teaches nothing\\, it does nothing harmful\\, and it really can't show you anything.\\n\\nSnoke. He's battered\\, possibly war-wounded and clearly quite old. He also has more power in the force than the Emperor\\, apparently. Thankfully we get lots of his back story and have such a great understanding of how he rose to power so we can fully appreciate his downfall.","true":true}
