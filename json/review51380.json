Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute trash. At times I contemplated walking out of the theater\\, though I instead opted to stay\\, hoping the \\nmovie might redeem itself. It did not. The end was equally as disappointing as the beginning and the middle. From pointless plotlines that take up the bulk of this sack of trash\\, to lead characters that I genuinely found myself wanting to die. If I had the choice\\, I would forget I ever saw it. This film soured me on star wars.","true":true}
