Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Anyone giving full stars is either paid off\\, a fake account\\, or doesn't understand what a good movie looks like because this was poorly edited\\, amazing actors were given nothing to do\\, and the last action-filled hour of the film doesn't forgive the first 1.5 hours that contained no chemistry between Skywalker and Rei\\, no interesting motivation for Skywalker\\, and the most stupid plot point of a First Order ship shooting weakly at a Rebel ship both flying at 30 miles an hour for\\, again\\, 1.5 hours. And the whole movie is about\\, get ready\\, evil bad guys dressed in black going after good guys trying to keep a rebellion alive. This is literally the plot of every single Star Wars movie. The one great scene is the Jedi fight scene with Kylo and Rei back-to-back. Just make a freakin Jedi action movie already. That's what everyone wants to see\\, you money-hungry\\, mouse worshipping idiots.","true":true}
