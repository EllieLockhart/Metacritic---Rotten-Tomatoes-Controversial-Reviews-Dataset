Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a very uneven film. They came up with some great plot points but really botched all the moments in between. Some of the CGI is not very good at all (whenever someone rides on top of something and when Poe slides into a ditch). None of the creatures felt like they were actually in the scene. For me\\, all the scenes with Rey\\, Kylo and Luke were really good. However\\, all the scenes with Fin\\, Poe and Leia were so bad that I audibly groaned about 3 times. I think the people giving it 1 star are doing so based off of their level of disappointment. It\u2019s nowhere near as bad as the prequels\\, but doesn\u2019t even come remotely close to The Force Awakens or Rogue One.","true":true}
