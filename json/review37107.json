Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about this movie is that every scene ends in a way you don't expect. I think Disney's intentions are to make more money by broadening everything in all possible directions. A kind of a reboot that will kill all ties with the past of Star Wars: the force is in everyone\\, there is no chosen one\\, there will be no jedi but anyone can act like a jedi if just believes in the force etc. This movie just leaves every possibility open\\, but it kills the essence of Star Wars. I even think the prequels were much better than TLJ\\, at least their story had some meaning and intention to bind to episode IV. I hate this movie it is just another Holywood disaster that pushes us away from theaters and towards TV series.","true":true}
