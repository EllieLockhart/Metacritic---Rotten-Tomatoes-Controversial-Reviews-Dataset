I was playing it with no affection I noticed.\r\rI felt the real The Last of Us kicked in\\, just during the Ellie's birthday flashback. But just that.\r\rAll the magical disappeard. All the vibe and finesse drowned. Everthing flows anemic.\r\rThe natural\\, plausable and logical reality of the first\\, replaced by a constant forced surrealistic scenario.\r\rAt some point I felt I was playing Resident Evil\\, with all the nonsense and unrealistic parts of that.\r\rI always thought The Last of Us was the game to look up because was such a game changer\\, a break through.\r\rEven the perfection of the 4 types of infected\\, with names and characteristics logically explained\\, with nothing exaggerated\\, screwed by a big ignorant monster like old type games.\r\rI thought this would have been a great occasion to see more of Ellie and Joel\\, more of what they started at the end of the first chapter. A dive deep into their lives.\r\rThey just went bad\u2026 Expand","true":true}
