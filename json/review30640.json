Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put\\, the writing in Hollywood these days are dead. They can't even make a franchise interesting\\, let alone writing something original. The personality of all these new characters are so one dimensional that everything lacks wisdom. This totally betrayed the memory of the original Star Wars series. I hope they don't produce any more Star Wars movie until they find a writer who is as witty as George R.R. Martin.","true":true}
