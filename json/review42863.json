Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was poorly written and executed terribly. Truly the worst Star Wars film\\, and yes I am saying the prequels are better. I didn't go see Solo because of this movie\\, and actually really enjoyed Solo when it came out on Netflix. As the RLM guys said\\, this should be called Star Wars: The Quest for Gas. Don't waste your time. ","true":true}
