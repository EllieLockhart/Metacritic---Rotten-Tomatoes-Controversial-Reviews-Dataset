Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The longer I think about this movie\\, the more I don't like it. Finn's storyline was terrible and seemed like something out of a Fantastic Beasts movie. They ruined Luke's character. They barely explained anything\\, especially about Snoke. Kylo Ren and some good moments of cinematography basically carried this movie. It's not quite \\\"Attack of the Clones\\\" level bad\\, but it's sort of close. Thank God Rian Johnson isn't making the next one.","true":true}
