Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A marginal good time.  The Disney white-washing of the script to create a Politically Correct hell\\, as well as brutally under-developing key characters\\, leaves this debacle what it was ---  a giant MEH!  At least Skywalker was put out to pasture.  The writers\/producers nailed his whiny character again perfectly.  But the plot is what really killed this film --- 2.5 hrs (seemed like a week in the movie) for the most powerful ships in the galaxy to run down a single rebel ship that is running out of gas...at least it wasn't another Star Destroyer film... what talentless-hack Millennial is writing this crap?  The only thing missing was JarJar Binx\\, but alas\\, we got something similar with the gerbils on Luke's island.  Not shocked to find gerbils on Luke's island\\, come to think of it.","true":true}
