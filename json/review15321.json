Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll be honest: this is the first time I've reviewed a movie on here.\\n\\nBecause it was that Terrible.\\n\\nEverything\\, from it's treatment of Legacy characters (Luke\\, Chewie\\, 3PO) to it's poor treatment of it's Own characters (Finn\\, Poe\\, Holdo) is how Not to make a movie.\\n\\nThe Training scenes were laughable\\, the Casino was Cringy\\, and of course there's the famous Leia scene.\\n\\nThe only halfway decent scenes were the space battle and lightsaber fight\\, and even Those are ruined by the scenes that follow.\\n\\nAlso\\, You'll notice most of the \\\"Positive\\\" reviews say almost Nothing about the movie (so which ones are Actually bots?)","true":true}
