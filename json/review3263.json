Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful visuals and some great performances.  Overall\\, key plot points are unnecessary and add to the overall film length without adding anything to the actual film.  The result of this film is a reset of expectations and direction for this franchise.  As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I disagree with these choices and am not anticipating further installments\\, which is incredibly disheartening.","true":true}
