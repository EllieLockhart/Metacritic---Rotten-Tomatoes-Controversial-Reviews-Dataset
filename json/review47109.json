Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a joke.  It's been several days of this trash movie stuck at 50% even though most of the reviews are 1\/2 or 1 star.  Stop manipulating the rating.  You sold out\\, Rotten Tomatoes\\, and we will never trust you again.","true":true}
