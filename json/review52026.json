{"101487":99819,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After first watching\\, I liked it\\, but I had mixed feelings\\, after second watching\\, I LOVE IT!!! You definitelly need to see it twice to catch all important stuff you will not catch for the first time\\, cause there are many stuff happening at the same time. I am disappointed by a couple of things as in any movie\\, but overall\\, movie is just amazing. Rian was not afraid to take risks\\, and that's exactly what this franchise needs right now. If it just repeats itself\\, what's the point to make more movies? Rian brought a lot of new and original stuff to the franchise\\, and I'm so glad he got another trilogy to work on\\, cause he is the right guy to do it!! \\nCharacters I loved: Luke\\, Kylo\\, Leia\\, Rey\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose and Holdo SPOILERS COMING - --    - Luke\\, still our hero\\, who almost did something terrible\\, but while he was explaining how he almost killed Ben in his sleep\\, he also said something like ''At that moment I failed myself'' and he started pulling down lightsaber\\, but Ben saw it already\\, and didn't realise that Luke won't kill him. That scene showed us that our favorite heroes have moment of weakeness\\, and that makes them even more releateble\\, and as Yoda said\\, we all learn from our failures. At the end\\, Luke sacrifised himself to give others opportunity to escape\\, he was not over powered\\, he was just first Jedi who was able to split from body\\, and come back\\, which was an amazing scene\\, at the end\\, he died\\, but peacefully and with purpose.                                                                                                       - Kylo is still most complex character ever\\, he was failed by his master\\, and he is still finding himself in the world he doesn't belong in\\, same as Rey\\, but at the end\\, they choosed different paths                                                                                                                                                  - Leia was amazing\\, while people complaing about ''flying Leia'' I mean\\, have You even see the movie?? She was floating in space\\, not flying\\, and she used the force\\, she grabed ship with the force to float\\, and she did it. It was an amazing moment\\, and it was so sad when mother says for her own son that he is hopeless. So many emotions in her storyline.                                               - Rey - hopefull character\\, who is also finding her place in this world. Her parents are important for her\\, but for us they shouldn't be that important. I mean\\, are Obi-Wan's parents important? No\\, he is great character because of what he is\\, not because he is releated sto someone. Also\\, J.J. made her too powerfull\\, but Rian kind of brought her power little bit down.                                      -  Poe was stubborn guy\\, he couldn't see bigger picture\\, but to fly and blow up stuff\\, and that's his biggest flaw as a person\\, but really nice characterisation.                                                                -  Holdo\\, at first you would thing she works with First order\\, but she is also looking bigger picture\\, at the end\\, we found out that all she did\\, Leia would do also\\, and her sacrifise was an amazing. One of the best sacrifises on big screen.                                                                                                                    - Finn and Rose - for Rose he was a hero\\, and she think it's a love at the end\\, but she only has a crush on him\\, same as anyone did with real life big stars. Their storyline wasn't that important\\, but they as characters were pretty good.                                                                                                 - DJ -  Didn't like him that much\\, but I liked what he said how other people just don't care\\, selling weapons to good and the bad guys just for money\\, which also shows situation in our real world.                                                                                                                     - Phasma was a joke. J.J. Made a joke out of her in ep7\\, and after that Garbage compactor\\, what ever they did with her in ep8\\, nobody could find her threatening after that. At least Rian gave her one small fight scene with Finn\\, which was more than fine\\, I still don't know why anyone expected from her to be big badass after episode 7 joke?                                                                                              - Snoke was really powerfull villain\\, but he was used as plot device to bring Kylo and Rey together\\, but as much as powerfull he is\\, he couldn't see clear picture\\, and see his own death. I'm only disappointed that after all those teases and everything\\, we still don't know nothing about him\\, but he should be big part of Ben\/Kylo storyline. \\nOver all\\, there are way too many positive things over negative. Love this movie so much!","true":true}
