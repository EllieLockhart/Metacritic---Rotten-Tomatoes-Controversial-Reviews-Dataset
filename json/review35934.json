Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is visually pretty\\, but that's where the beauty ends\\, and the ugly begins.\\n\\nIn a film shoehorned full of bad plot lines\\, (including the main one\\, where rebel ships are \\\"running out of fuel\\\" in space) the movie fails to engage the audience in anything other than a series of attempted plot twists which fail so spectacularly to stun anyone\\, that they explode more vividly than anything the admittedly talented CGI department could have dreamed of. \\n\\nCharacters we've waited 30 years to see on screen again are butchered down and rebuilt into monstrosities we cannot recognize\\, and new characters are rewritten entirely\\, or written with the utmost disregard for even the slightest research into their histories and motivations.\\n\\nA side plot dominates 45 minutes of the B-movie style main plot\\, during which nothing is added except a character nearly on par in worthlessness to JarJar Binks. Watching this movie puts a bad taste in your mouth- and worse yet- leaves you bored by the middle point. \\n\\nAwful direction seems to plague this movie\\, which is acted well\\, shot beautifully\\, and just\\, just\\, so very terribly bad. This doesn't feel like Star Wars. This feels like someone who didn't know what Star Wars was\\, wrote a fan fiction and thought \\\"Yeah\\, science fiction\\, i can write one of those\\\"\\n\\nRian Johnson sure seems proud of himself\\, but noone else is. This movie has ended my interest in Star Wars. I'll just find another series to donate my time and money to.","true":true}
