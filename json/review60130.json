The witty banter between character's during gameplay is consistent with part I.The puzzles feel much more subtle and tricky and less bland compared to the puzzles of part I. Naughty Dog never fails with graphics and environments and TLOU2 is no exception. Combat environments feel very fluid\\, stealth feels even more viable than the original because of how mobile you're allowed to be. Overall the gameplay feels familiar but more polished. Cons: The story is told in a non linear fashion which I enjoyed\\, however some parts are noticeably slower than others. Most of the game kept me engaged either with story beats or new gameplay features or new enemies\\, but there were some times where I felt like I wanted to see more of a different part of the plot\\, and the part I was playing through didn't do quite enough to pull me in. The game isn't long enough. In all seriousness the game felt quite long especially after having just completed the first game\\, but even still as I approached the end I kept hoping I was far away from the credits.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
