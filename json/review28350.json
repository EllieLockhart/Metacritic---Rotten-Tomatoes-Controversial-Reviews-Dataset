Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Positives: Cinematography and impressive visuals.\\n\\nNegatives: No explanation for how the First Order has recovered after having its Starkiller Base destroyed. Betrayed Luke's character. Should have let Leia die. Why has lightspeed never been used as a weapon before? The entire casino subplot could have been cut and it would have made virtually no difference to the plot. Why didn't Vice Admiral Holdo tell anyone about her plan? Rey is still a Mary Sue. Uncomfortable forced romance between Finn and Rose. Supposedly extremely powerful Snoke easily killed with no explanation of his character. Far too much attempted humour.","true":true}
