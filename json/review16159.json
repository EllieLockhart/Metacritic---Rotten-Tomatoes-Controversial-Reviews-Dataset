Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving it an extra half a star because they went through hell it's a fine movie but it had some stupid points such as the fight scene in the throne room which believe me made me like the movie more but the choreography sucked the second time I watched it\\, overall I just don't like the story it didn't seem like Star Wars and the universe it's in and God I hate Reylo fans. But if you know nothing about Legends it's a fine addition to your collection.","true":true}
