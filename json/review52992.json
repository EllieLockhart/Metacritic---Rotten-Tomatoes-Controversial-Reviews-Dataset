Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a film\\, this is a solid 3\/5 (cut 20 mins of pointless filler and you have a 4). However\\, as a Star Wars film\\, it's barely a 2\/5. Finally\\, as a continuation of the trilogy\\, it remains to be seen what this film is. It was subversive and bold\\, but that is not what audiences come to Star Wars for. This film is the one trick shot where Daffy Duck blows himself up in a spectacular stunt and says \\\"I can only do it once.\\\"\\n\\nAs one professional critic who actually loved the film said\\, \\\"It's the gazillion-dollared\\, 152-minute equivalent to setting fire to all of your childhood Star Wars toys in the backyard\\, and getting high off the fumes that follow.\\\" This is not just true of the orginal trilogy\\, The Last Jedi pretty much tosses asside the set up handed to it\\, figuratively and literally (Luke and that lightsaber)\\, by The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThe episode 9 will decide how this one ages. If the decisions here can spawn a rebirth that makes a real connection with the audience \\, while possibly repenting of the heresy we witnessed\\, Star Wars will be better than ever. If not\\, well\\, then The Force Awakens in the end of canon as far as I am concerned.","true":true}
