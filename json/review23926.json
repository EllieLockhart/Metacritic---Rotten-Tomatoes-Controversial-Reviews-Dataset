Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Making my first rating on average tomatoes simply because so many people are hating on this movie. People are hating this movie too much. I could go into it so much deeper but instead im just going to leave it as this\\, its a good star wars movie\\, and it goes back to its roots at least in how light hearted it is in between serious moments. It's in no way an unenjoyable movie.","true":true}
