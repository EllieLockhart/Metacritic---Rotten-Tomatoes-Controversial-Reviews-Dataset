What in the hell is wrong with you naughty dog... Honestly the death of Joel I had accepted a long time ago\\, and to be truthful? I expected it at the end or near end of this game. But no... 2 hours in... without even giving us a chance to use his character in game! Especially after you advertised this game with Joel and Ellie featuring in the trailers heavy and literally lying to us with regards to the \u201cdidn\u2019t think I would make you do this in your own\u201d scene... that\u2019s a separate issue I have entirely!!!Graphics were amazing as per usual\\, music and general workings of the game were 10\/10...But the story had literally killed this franchise for me. Such a shame you had 7 years and kept us waiting for that... what a pile of crap\u2026 Expand","true":true}
