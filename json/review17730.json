Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It definitely subverted my expectations. Good job on that I suppose? I think Disney should let this franchise go to rest. We need new and fun movies anyway\\, not dusted off\\, dug-up corpses of what used to be great classics.","true":true}
