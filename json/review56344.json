Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. A disaster. A tragedy of cinematic historical proportion. I stood in line for the first showing of Star Wars - Episode IV . I am a major fan\\, but not a fanatic. My guess is that this franchise is more important to more people than any other. I was optimistic about the move to Disney. I liked Episode VII; in my view\\, it maintained the tradition and gave me New Hope. Now\\, that is gone. This train wreck failed in the most important way: the story. I won't be in line for the next one\\, but will be interested to hear whether Disney approved a total sell out and made the franchise a vehicle for children and pre-teens\\, or whether they give it back to JJ\\, and tried to put it back on track as much as possible as if Episode Viii never happened. PS I know the Empire Strikes Back. I loved the Empire Strikes Back. This disaster cannot seriously be compared to that film.","true":true}
