Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very Forced.\\n\\nThe humor didn't fit into the film\\, it was clearly shoehorned in to sell toys. I'm not saying I didn't laugh but the humor was gag based instead of character based. humor happened around the main characters instead of involving them directly.\\n\\nFinn and Rose are irrelevant to the film. *SPOILERS* The only thing that happened as a direct result of their actions is the death of resistance fighters. \\n\\nRain Johnson managed to drop the ball with every plot thread. He dropped threads from the Force Awakens as well as his own film. There are several plot points he intentionally sets up to later then drop as if it didn't matter in the first place.\\n\\nI just don't feel that Rian Johnson understands what makes Star Wars special. *SPOILERS* Rey's parents being worthless nobodies sure does make a statement but it's lazy and boring story telling. Having an all powerful force compensate on behalf of your protagonist just shows an inability to write and develop an interesting character arc.","true":true}
