Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is an abomination to the series and a swift kick in the groin to diehard fans.   It's as if Rian Johnson listed out on a whiteboard everything the fan base would want answers about or to see: 1) What is Snoke's backstory? 2) Who are Rey's parents? 3) Luke being a hero and just completely subverted expectations purposefully.  The answer to Rey's parentage is horrible.  Alcoholic parents who sell her off to get more booze? Snoke is killed halfway through without even a fight or battle? Luke doesn't even fight and then he dies?  \\n\\nI get that on occasion you want to have humor in the movie to keep it fun\\, but the humor here was just awful\\, and at times cringey.  \\n\\nWORST. STAR WARS. EVER.","true":true}
