Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Maybe not as good as TFA but this movie is put in place to set up the next in the franchise. Sure\\, there are some plot holes and poor moments but those haters out there in my opinion (and seem to consider themselves experts) in mind do not follow why certain caracters are done away with. Kylo is now in place to be the next Supreme leader\\, so the demise of Snoke had to happen. Luke was shown as having lost faith in The Force\\, and therefore his less than enthusiastic attitude\\, until he re-enters the fray near the end as a real force and what can be acheived with it. Those of you who see this as Lukes demise - I do not. I think and hope\\, he is only now being reborn as a major part of the rebirth of the rebellion and the ultimate victory (and end of this trilogy) over the dark side\\, and will still play a major role in that defeat! Those that really hate this movie don't seem to follow (what I hope) is the next and unseen direction this movie has put in place for a great final end of era of the next movie.","true":true}
