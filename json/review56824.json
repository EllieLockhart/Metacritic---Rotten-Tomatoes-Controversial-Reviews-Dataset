Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Pros:nice special effects (so +1 star)\\nCons: irrelevant story\\, irrelevant and boring characters (some who attract the audiences attention just disappear\\, some are cheaply pushed into the plot) \\, embarrassingly unfunny slap stick comedy moments\\, full of logic flaws\\, forced creatures who are obviously only introduced because you can sell some plush figures\\, \\n\\npersonally\\, i think a huge amount of stakeholders (feminists\\, vegetarians\\, merchandising department\\, anti capitalists) tried to force the writers to include their stuff\\, and resulted in a movie plot\\, that consists of fragments\\, that seem to be completely out of place\\, embedded in the star wars universe.\\nobviously\\, the makers were only interested in generating maximum profit by packing all this stuff into the movie\\, to look appealing for an audience as big as possible\\, instead of trying to create memorable a star wars masterpiece\\n\\nall in all\\, huge marketing\\, fantastic special effects\\, but a very dull movie.\\n\\nwhat a waste of potential","true":true}
