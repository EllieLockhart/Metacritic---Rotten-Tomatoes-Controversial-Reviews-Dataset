Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Funny\\, epic\\, and sage.  The Last Jedi is one of the most visually stunning\\, surprising and emotional movie-going experiences I've had in a very long time.  It reinvigorates everything you loved about the original films while taking bold and fresh steps forward\\, alternating intrepidly between fulfilling and challenging our expectations.  With a wonderfully diverse cast of actors all of whom are at the top of their game\\, its spot-on and timely messaging\\, and overwhelming cinematography\\, this is a film made at once for our present and future moment - one that everyone should see and be absolutely floored by.","true":true}
