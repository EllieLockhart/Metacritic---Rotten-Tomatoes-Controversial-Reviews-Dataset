Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Still surprised audience score doesn't drop\\, seems to be locked in place. It's a terrible movie\\, avoid at all cost. It should be banned from the canon\\, it does not deserve to have \\\"Star Wars\\\" in the title. CGI may be fine\\, but the plot is the most ridiculous ever. It is NOT possible to go to lightspeed in normal space and plough into another ship. Else lightspeed would be impossible at all anyway. Any form of debris would be lethal. Lightspeed is only possible when going into a 4th dimension\\, warped space etc.","true":true}
