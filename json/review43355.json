Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a huge disappointment and basically made the Force Awakens completely irrelevant.  There was no real Luke-Rey training scenes\\,  Snoke was killed without learning who he is\\, Luke dies from using the force too much and the majority of the movie is more about a weak Rebellion story\\, made just to have video game scenes. \\n\\nMost dissapointed I have ever been watching a movie. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for putting this movie out and calling it Episode 8. This movie has completely killed the trilogy and seems to be unfixable at this point.","true":true}
