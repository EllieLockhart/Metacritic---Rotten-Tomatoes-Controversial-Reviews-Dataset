Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Contrived\\, nonsensical\\, subverts expectations just for the sake of it with very little pay off. Changes the iconic character Luke Skywalker into someone unrecognisable. Great visuals\\, though. Too bad the story is shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!","true":true}
