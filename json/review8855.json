Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For so long\\, elevated and held captive by Star Wars\\, I'm still reeling from an series which has unexpectedly turned on me\\, as if a dear friend had always been pretending to be someone else. A vast pond of shallow depths\\, The Last Jedi spends its precious time throwing darts at corny humor during its most critical moments for potential growth. I left feeling stunningly uninspired and helplessly betrayed\\, and wondering if who I've always thought I was\\, is who I've always been\\, and if it's still who I am now.","true":true}
