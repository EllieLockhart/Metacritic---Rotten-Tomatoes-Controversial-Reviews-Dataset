Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot has more holes than swiss cheese. Undeveloped and unnecessary characters. Just a mess of a film. Kathleen Kennedy should be fired for giving Rian Johnson so much control over the film. ","true":true}
