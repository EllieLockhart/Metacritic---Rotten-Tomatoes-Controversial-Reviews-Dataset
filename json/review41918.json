Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is wonderful. I seriously do not understand how people rave about Rouge\\, and diss this one. This had everything that made the first one so good. Humor\\, action\\, story. I loved it. This is my favorite Star Wars movie out of the franchise right now. We saw it when it opened and the audience was having a blast. Whooping and clapping. It was fun non stop. LOVE IT.","true":true}
