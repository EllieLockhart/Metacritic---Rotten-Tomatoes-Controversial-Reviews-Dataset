Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie and look past it's flaws\\, but I couldn't. This is the first Star Wars film I've seen that doesn't feel like Star Wars. And no\\, I'm not saying it should've been like Empire Strikes Back. I'm saying this could've been a different take on Star Wars without making such drastic changes from the lore and story that's already been built up. I was very disappointed. This movie literally killed my expectations for Episode 9. Hopefully Lucasfilm will see their mistakes and fix it. Hopefully they see how much this movie upset Star Wars fans. But then again\\, they've gotten their money. All they see right now is dollar signs.","true":true}
