Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars. I hoped The Force Awakens was the ropey lead in to what would be the amazing 2nd sequel episode that would finally let us see Luke Skywalker become what he was meant to be. Instead I saw my greatest\\, favourite character\/hero of all time get utterly shat over (and that's far from all that was wrong with it). Having seen the original trilogy well in excess of 100 times each\\, Last Jedi will be the only \\\"SW\\\" film I only ever watch once\\, and I can't believe I'm saying this\\, but no way I'm paying (or even watching for free) the next installment in Disney's diatribe :(","true":true}
