Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I found this movie overall really enjoyable. It is a character development movie\\, that's the ourpose it serves\\, maybe that's why I enjoyed it. I'm all for watching hours of character build up\\, but I do realize it's flaws. The way they presented some character growth and the way they chose to show maturity in a certain character lead to unnecessary storyline that ended being useless\\, except for adding maybe one thing the main plot. Snoke was an Underwhelming villain which had a too simple defeat\\, Phasma was a character with lost potential\\, Luke had his out-of-character moments. Ben Solo\/Kylo Ren is a fry villain\\, and that was emphasized in this film; I find his character much more interesting with this character trait. There is a\\, current\\, balance with Rey and Ben being equally matched in their connection with the force. I found this film to be fun and enjoyable overall. It is a movie that I will rewatch\\, but it still left the audience with previous and new questions\\, all which will hopefully resolve themselves in Episode IX. Another plus: Poe is Leia's pseudo-son_Another con: There will be negative wtf moments.","true":true}
