Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was proof positive  that the goal of Disney pertaining to this franchise was to strip mine it and use its burned out husk to spew the rotten\\, stinking\\, extremist  political philosophy  shared by K. Kennedy  and R. Johnson  into the faces of Star Wars fans. All attempts at creating good characters\\,  plot\\, and dialogue were abandoned in preference to this end. Avoid this contagion if you value your soul.","true":true}
