Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was better than the Prequels and yet worse at the same time. How Rian Johnson handled Luke Skywalker. The story Rian Johnson has told is acceptable if this were just another sci-fi movie\\, but it isn't. It's Star Wars. This story need someone to bring an A+++ story to the table and then tell it really well. That's not what we got. We got a long drawn out attempt at an epic story. Somehow Disney forgot that this isn't a comedy but should contain humor. They've lost what it means to be heroic and self sacrificing. It doesn't build on what it's inherited. It's simply pushing it aside attempting to redefine what it means to be heroic and epic. Poor to no character development. Too many characters that you just don't care about or even know why they have screen time and not any of the other characters encountered. Sheesh! Dropping bombs in space? We've overlooked the imperfections of the original trilogy because the characters and story were solid and gripping. The actors and actresses performances in this were fantastic\\, even if I didn't agree with the character portrayal\\, but as a Star Wars film it gets one star. One star for how fantastic the visual effects were and being able to see the Star Wars world one again.","true":true}
