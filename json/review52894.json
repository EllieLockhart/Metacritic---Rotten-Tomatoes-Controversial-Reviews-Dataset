Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An abundance of plot wholes and continuity errors between not only The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi\\, but also just existing within the film to begin with contribute to this score. \\n-- Moderate Spoilers below for this film and Previous Star Wars films------\\nThe Sequel Trilogy CONTINUES to lack Purpose with this installment. The purpose of the prequel trilogy was to establish and present the occured events leading unto the original Trilogy and follow the journey of the first generation of the Skywalkers (Anakin) and Kenobi. The purpose of the Original Trilogy is the resolution of this conflict and the story of the second Generation of the Skywalkers. With the reveal of Rey\\, this further adds to the redundancy of the Sequel Trilogy of movies. They add no value\\, except diluting the effects and impacts of the previous two trilogies whilst paired\\, and for no purpose other than a message \\\"that anyone can be a hero too.\\\" It completely rejects the Story of the Skywalkers being that of the story of Star Wars\\, the story of each family's Generations' trials\\, challenges\\, and destinies. \\n\\nThis movie also ruins and cripples the legacy of Original Trilogy established characters\\, while also further ruining character established in this film's previous installment\\, The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThis film tries so hard to be different that it doesn't understand that without certain elements that it threw away\\, there is honestly no reason to care about Episodes 7-9\\, lacking any and all purpose to their attempted story telling. \\n\\nBut most of the visuals were quality. So congratulations on earning one half a star.","true":true}
