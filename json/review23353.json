Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it so much I can't wait to see it again. Then can't wait to purchase it on Digital. It was a great Star Wars movie. Despite what many other people felt. To me it felt like a great Star Wars movie. More so than the prequels. To me it didn't feel long either. Longest Star Wars movie ever! It was awesome.","true":true}
