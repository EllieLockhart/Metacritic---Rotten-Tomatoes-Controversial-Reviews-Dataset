Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any \\\"fan\\\" complaining about how stuff is missing from the books has not been paying attention because when Disney got control they released a statement that they were scrapping all cannon not in the official movies.\\n\\nWhile not a fan of this decision the fact is that it was made and it's done\\, and no amount of bitching about it is going to change that fact.\\n\\nOverall it is a \\\"Good\\\" Star Wars movie and well worth seeing on the big screen.","true":true}
