Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The summary? Meh. It is an utterly beautiful film with incredible production values\\, and sound and visual moments that will truly make you lost for words. They use music and sound (and most importantly silence) to set the scene well. For the most part the characters are good\\, although they really needed to narrow down the number of simultaneous plot lines in order to make us properly buy in to the characters.\\nBut. And it is a big but! The story is honestly terrible. I don't mean from the Star Wars fanboy 'oh Luke wouldn't have done this or that'\\, but in a more general sense. The timelines make no sense whatsoever\\, and the number of plotlines prevent us properly investing in any of them. \\nAll in all\\, it is a passable sci-fi film\\, but a disappointing Star Wars one.","true":true}
