Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson (Looper) takes over from JJ Abrams in the director's chair to deliver the 2nd installment in this new Star Wars trilogy.\\n\\nCarrying on where The Force Awakens left off\\, we see the Resistance led my General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher in her final role before passing away) pursued by the heavily manned First Order whilst new character from the previous film\\, Rey (Daisy Ridley) tracks down Jedi master in hiding\\, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and discovers more about why the Force and what drove Luke to seek solace on the planet Ahch-To.\\n\\nAdam Driver returns as Kylo Ren\\, apprentice to Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and it's his relationship with Rey and Luke which provides the film with it's most interesting themes and concepts\\, as the lines between light and dark become blurred.\\n\\nEarly in the film\\, we are introduced to new character Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran) who is involved in a subplot with Finn (John Boyega) as they track down a codebreaker to aid the Rebellion.  Some feel that this subplot is unnecessary and slows the film down\\, however\\, I felt that it served to introduced themes unseen in Star Wars before.\\n\\nCarrie Fisher\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Adam Driver all deliver excellent performances and Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac (returning as Poe Dameron) continue to impress.\\n\\nThere are some unexpected returning characters which I won't spoil\\, but there is a moment that did make me cry and want to punch the air at the same time.  As punching the air is not a done thing in the cinema I settled for just crying instead.\\n\\nThis film has divided fans\\, some feeling that it doesn't meet their high expectations and it is by no means perfect but it is the most nuanced Star Wars film to date and tries to take the saga in a new direction.","true":true}
