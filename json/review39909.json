Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever. I don't even want to call it a Star Wars movie. Complete garbage. I didn't care for these new characters in TFA but in TLJ it has gotten so much worse it is not even funny. I will never pay money to see another Disney Star Wars movie ever!!!","true":true}
