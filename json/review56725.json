Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is disappointing in so many ways.\\nIts worst crime is the assassination of Luke's character\\, merely for the sake of 'developing' characters of Kylo and Rey.\\nAlso\\, just like in The Force Awakens\\, Rey is a 'Mary Sue' here\\, she never really struggles\\, easily overcomes all the obstacles without any training whatsoever.\\nThe list can go on: no backstory or explanation for Snoke\\, Finn's become a side character\\, porgs\\, space Leia...\\nThis really makes me sad as a Star Wars fan. From the 3 new films\\, only Rogue One was good and satisfying. I am certainly not looking forward to Episode IX.","true":true}
