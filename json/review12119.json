Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a father with two daughters running around pretending to be Rey after seeing the movie twice. That's Star Wars to me. There are very  strong inspiring female characters beyond just Rey in this movie that gives the franchise a great future.\\n\\nReading some of the bad reviews it seems to me anyone who wanted the movie to turn out exactly like everyone predicted on the Internet is disappointed. Get over it! \\\"This is not going to go the way you think!\\\" Luke told you himself ;)","true":true}
