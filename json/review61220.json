Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Having read a lot of reviews for this game; I think some people need to remember that it is\\, after all\\, only a video game. Admittedly it\u2019s the sequel to a masterfully made original\\, but still not of earth shattering importance. It\u2019s not a \u201c0\u201d nor is it a \u201c10\u201d. I believe it is a good enjoyable game but not as excellent as the original. This is a common phenomenon. With the possible exception of The Godfather Part 2\\, how often is the sequel not as good as the original masterpiece?\r\rI have been wracking my brain to try and work out what exactly is wrong with this sequel. I think the main issue is the disconnect between the actual gameplay and the story concepts. The game play glorifies murder. For example\\, there are no non lethal  takedown\\, no ability to avoid conflict with all the uninfected enemies and some extremely brutal death animations. This is not a criticism as many video games do the same thing. I for one really enjoyed the virtual blood bath that makes up the majority of the game! However\\, many of the cut scenes and story concepts try and portray the opposite by Illustrating the negative side of violence and revenge. During such cut scenes\\, I found myself thinking \u201cyeah\\, yeah - when can I get back to the slaughtering?\u201d The actions of Abby and Ellie during some of the cut scenes just did not ring true. They seemed dishonest as if the characters are pretending to be sickened by the violence but can\u2019t wait to get back to the murdering. I think this creates too much of a disconnect and does not make the characters believable or relatable.\r\rIn addition\\, efforts made  to expound the story concepts and explain all the character arcs made the game over long. I felt it should have ended sooner\\, perhaps when Abby let\u2019s Ellie go after the fight in the theatre.\r\rHaving said all that\\, it\u2019s still an enjoyable\\, action packed and excellently animated experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
