Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Slow your roll there\\, fan boys.  So\\, Luke didn't come down on the Jade Shadow and select you as his personal Palawan.  You and the Young Jedi Knights didn't get to fight Abeloth in the final battle.  Boo hoo.  Disney didn't read your fan fiction or listen to your tweets.  You didn't get the Star Wars YOU wanted.\\n\\nIt's not your story\\, so get over it.  As a big fan of the old EU\\, I was disappointed when it all went to legends\\, but TLJ is a bold move on finishing the character arcs of the original 3.  Rest assured we will see more of some of them as was foreshadowed in the Tree scene.  But your hate will not make your powerful because its born of jealous rage of not being able to write your own story.","true":true}
