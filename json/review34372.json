Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The beginning was good\\, the new force powers were interesting. I didn't entirely like the sub plot with Finn and Rose and was constantly just waiting for the story to go back to Rey and Kylo. I feel like they tried to push humor too much and they ruined.characters. Luke's character was garbage and Mark Hamil feels the same way.","true":true}
