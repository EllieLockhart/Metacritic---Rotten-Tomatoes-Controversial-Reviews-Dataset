Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never expected this movie to be so terrible. I knew it wouldn't be great based on how bland and plagerized the force awakens was. When I found out that rotten tomatoes gave it a 92 percent\\, I had to sign up just to tell the world that rotten tomatoes are a bunch of sellout frauds. This is an outright scandal. Shame on all of you rotten tomatoes\\, your a disgrace.","true":true}
