Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely loved it! Rian Johnson has blown away the rigid structure of the previous movies and opened up the SW universe to a multitude of awesome possibilities. Are there difficulties with it? Yes\\, but no more than all of the previous movies. This movie keeps you guessing and\\, as Luke states\\, it doesn't go the way you think it will. For the SW universe\\, that's a great thing. As a member of the Class of 1977 (been there since the beginning)\\, I say \\\"Bring on more SW!!\\\" #hatersgonnahate #GoSeeThisMovie","true":true}
