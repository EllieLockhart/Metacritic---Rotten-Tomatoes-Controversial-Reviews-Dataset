Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the best Star Wars films to date.  Having loved all of the Star Wars films thus far (yes\\, I even liked the Prequels)\\, this one stunned me by how incredibly well done it was!","true":true}
