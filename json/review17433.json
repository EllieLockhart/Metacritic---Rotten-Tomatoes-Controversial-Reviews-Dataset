Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the original Star wars in theaters way back in 1977 and I enjoyed this film.  i could have done without the casino planet arc..  but I enjoyed the rest quite well. my childhood memories are fully intact and my hat is off to Rian.","true":true}
