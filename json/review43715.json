Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most disappointing Star Wars film to date. Totally unsatisfied with where they took the franchise and how they mocked Luke and the fans who love Star Wars. Pretty much everything great about Star Wars they threw out the window\\, replaced by terrible cringey humor and twilight-esque love scenes. This will be the last money I ever give to see a Star Wars film. Such a shame. RIP Star Wars 1977-2017. Even 2017 ruined Star Wars... :(","true":true}
