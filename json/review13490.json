Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If THE FORCE AWAKENS felt to some views like too much retreading of familiar ground\\, the second entry in this latest trilogy\\, THE LAST JEDI\\, decides to go boldly in a different direction.  I will admit that not all the elements of the plot work well (the movie seems a bit too long at two and a half hours\\, and there is at least one moment early in the film that borders on goofiness)\\, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained by every second of it.  On the contrary.  Even with a slightly shaky middle third\\, I found THE LAST JEDI to be magnetic and tense\\, very much edge-of-your-seat territory\\, especially the third and fourth acts.\\n\\nFor all of those wishing George Lucas would take the reins back from Disney\\, keep in mind\\, the man had great ideas\\, but he didn't always execute them well.  For one thing\\, he was never an actors' director\\, resulting in a lot of stiff performances from otherwise seasoned veterans.  Whether you agree with the choices of plot directions director Rian Johnson has done with this movie or not\\, it can't be denied that these newer movies contain some really solid acting.  Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley sizzle in their roles as Kylo Ren and Rey\\, respectively -- especially a tense confrontation scene toward the finale\\, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaacs provide us with new heroes to root for.  But the film ultimately belongs to Mark Hamill\\, who turns in  what could very well be his best performance ever in the STAR WARS franchise.  His Luke is portrayed in a different light than we have come to expect\\, but Hamill's believable turn makes us buy every second of it.  A climactic showdown at the end in particular\\, shows the man is underrated as an actor.\\n\\nAt one point in the movie\\, Luke utters \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\"  This line also sets the tone for the movie in many ways -- THE LAST JEDI isn't afraid to take chances or be bold in its plot directions\\, and as mentioned\\, not everyone will agree\\, but overall I found the movie to be a very satisfying and emotionally gripping STAR WARS tale.  I arguably found it better than THE FORCE AWAKENS (which I still liked\\, honestly)\\, and easily the prequels (REVENGE OF THE SITH excepted\\, perhaps).\\n\\nNo matter which side of the fence you fall on\\, you're no doubt going to probably see this movie regardless.  C'mon\\, it's STAR WARS.  You know you will.","true":true}
