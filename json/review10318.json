Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great Movie. People complains are just complain about stupid stuff and crying about \\\"RUINED CHILDHOOD\\\" because the movie was not a copy as The Force Awakens was or because It was not a fan service. Rian Johnson made an excellent job. By the way\\, Rotten Tomatoes should keep an eye in trolls and Star Trek fans because there many of them giving bad reviews without even see the movie.","true":true}
