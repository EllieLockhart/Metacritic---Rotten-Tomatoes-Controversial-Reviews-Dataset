Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think The Last Jedi is good Star Wars movie. Better than Force Awakens.Loot space battles in the movie I think this is great.\\nSpoilers:\\n\\nI understand the peoples who disappointed about Snoke.\\nSnoke dead shocked me to but Kylo Ren is the emperor now.\\nDarth Vader plan same as Kylo Ren but Vader killed the emperor to late and he is dead beacuse of it. Snoke line in the movie very short we know about him very a little\\,but I prefer Kylo Ren as the emperor.And who knows maybe the next movie appers new sith lord maybe Snoke master or Darth Sidious.\\nLuke dead scene is very sad to me but beautiful\\,very emotional scene.I almost cried.When he look the sky and two sun just like the new hope.Movie has beautiful imagery.Mark Hammil acting fantastic in the movie.Luke very badass. :).And the final fight is epic.Good lightaber battles.Yoda appears very nostalgic\\, good scene.Kylo Ren finally acting like a sith lord\\,I know he is'nt. Epic movie.Rey is very good in this movie\\, she is a good jedi.\\nI think the true star wars fans like the movie.\\nCant wait the Episode 9.","true":true}
