Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"This is not going to   go the way you think\\\". \\n\\nI consider myself a reasonably enfranchised Star Wars fan. I was raised on the Original Trilogy a few years before Phantom Menace hit\\, read tons of the old\\, now discontinued legends EU (including all Thrawn books)\\, and have watched all of Clone Wars and most of Rebels. Many folks feel like this movie ruins what Star Wars stands for\\, but to me with all that context it perfects and completes it. \\n\\nI can't say much without giving away key plot points\\, so some quick hits:\\n- Great acting\\, with Mark Hamill in particular giving the performance of a lifetime. Every scene with Luke is full of such a complex range of emotion - Luke is hurting\\, he's angry\\, he's cynical\\, he's tired\\, he's scared\\, he's tormented and full of despair and trauma\\, and through all of that he can still find the ability to be wise and funny and warm. \\n- Visually stunning\\, with a sequence during the extended rollercoaster finale that is one of the most haunting\\, beautiful\\, and horrific (in a \\\"war is horrific) way) things I've seen in any sci-film anywhere ever. You'll know it when you see it. \\n- Every character's arc is a surprise. This is a movie willing to shock\\, to dismay\\, to cause discomfort. Not a single character's arc goes how I would have guessed it to. I was wrong with ALL my fan theories. And yet\\, even the anticlimaxes and subversions make total sense and weave together one of the most poetic and thematically tight entries Star Wars has ever put out. \\n\\nThe flaws\\, to me\\, are minor. I will say that the movie's biggest flaw is Finn's storyline. I love Finn\\, don't get me wrong\\, but compared to the magnetic philosophical sparring between Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke and the jittery\\, intense war story Poe and Admiral Holdo find themselves in\\, Finn's story feels like a drag every time we pull to it - especially when we hit \\\"broken bridge\\\" after \\\"broken bridge\\\" on Canto Bite that drags out that particular storyline for what feels like extremely little pay-off. The movie feels a bit overlong as a result. Even so\\, this is not just a great Star Wars\\, it is a great film.","true":true}
