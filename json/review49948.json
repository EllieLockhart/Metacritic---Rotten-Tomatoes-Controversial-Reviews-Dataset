Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know\\, the movie was probably the best star wars movie on individual terms. My problem is that it really ruined the Star Wars Legacy. I fundamentally disagree with everything Rian Johnson believed Luke was after Return of The Jedi. It was just a shame. Awful movie for the die hard fans\\, great movie for the new fans or casual fans. Being a die hard fan myself\\, I simply can't give this movie a good rating. So sad :(","true":true}
