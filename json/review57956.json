Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What went wrong with this movie? This film was the biggest disappointment I could have imagined. Not only is this not a good star wars movie this is an awful sequel to The Force Awakens. It seems like the people behind The Last Jedi didn't even watch TFA. This movie feels more like a parody of the movie we should have got rather than the movie we did get. I've lost all anticipation of episode IX now\\, I just don't see how anyone can make a competent sequel to this horrible mess of a movie. I'm inclined to think that this movie should be forgotten and remade. ","true":true}
