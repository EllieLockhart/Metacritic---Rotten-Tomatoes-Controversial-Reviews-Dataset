Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was visually very beautiful\\, exciting and entertaining. It does\\, however\\, destroy Luke Skywalker as a character\\, de-mystifies The Force and lacks even basic storytelling finesse. Rey is an uninteresting character because she works for nothing. There is no struggle or growth. The First Order is comically buffoonish. It's a complete waste of some of the best visuals I have ever seen on film. Tragic.","true":true}
