Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the neck beard Star Wars elitists who pre determine how movies should go\\, this was an entertaining movie. The complainers will y'all about Lukes personality as if people are the same after 30 years and complete isolation for years.","true":true}
