Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good: Everything with Kylo & Rey was great\\, and it was an entertaining film.\\nBad: The main plot is that the empire can't catch up to a little cruiser (or send tie fighters out to kill them)\\, so they have to chase them at the exact same speed for 12 hours until the rebels run out of fuel. All the while\\, the rebels have time to go to another system\\, get thrown in jail\\, set a single animal free on a small island to be captured again\\, and come back. Then when Finn is about to heroically sacrifice himself\\, Rose rams into him (how did she go faster than him?) thus likely dooming everyone in the resistance so she could tell him she had a crush on him. Luke died without a great enough 'last hurrah'\\, and Luke milking a walrus was terrible.","true":true}
