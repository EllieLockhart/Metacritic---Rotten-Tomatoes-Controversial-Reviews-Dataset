{"101487":139208,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really loved the film\\, even the fact that it was unlike the predicted storyline. Grumpy Luke? Why not\\, he vocalizes all the reasons jedi way might not be the right way and anyhow that the end of jedi is not the end of the force. Flying Leia? Again\\, why not?? The jedi can make things fly\\, it is only a small step from elevating themselves. The large role of women? Jees\\, is it really so bad to have female heroes? Some people are incredible shauvinists. Anyhow\\, the trolling should finally stop! It is ridiculous to see how many people voted 1\/2 point - I hated the prequels and even Episode I\\, with its many many problems\\, would deserve 2.5 stars from me because it still had some merits. This downvoting seems an intentional attack. You people might hate Disney but DO NOT TAKE IT OUT ON THE LAST JEDI!! Even if you did not like it\\, it is a good film and deserves credit! \\nLast words: I loved it - it might be different\\, but that is actually good. New direction\\, new breeze. 5***** and I do recommend it!!!","true":true}
