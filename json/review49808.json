Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, i made an account for this review... but because this star wars movie was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!111 I even liked the force awakens\\, its was pretty cool. but this... the story war crazy luke was not luke\\, overall a stupid attempt to marvel guardians of the galaxy","true":true}
