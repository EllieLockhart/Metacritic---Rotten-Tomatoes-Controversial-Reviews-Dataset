Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was beautifully shot\\, but ultimately had no respect for anything that came before it. Virtually every decision from both beloved old characters and the charismatic new heroes was wrong. If you look at this movie on its own merits\\, it may warrant a higher rating\\, but because this is merely an episode of a larger saga\\, it cannot be viewed that way. I understand that the underlying themes of the movie are about change\\, letting go of the past\\, and the lessons from failure. However these themes were not worth the destruction of 40 years of established story. This movie makes all of the actions\\, triumphs\\, and sacrifices of the previous generation moot. The biggest sting from this disappointment of a movie is not just that it ruins canon\\, but of what it could have been.","true":true}
