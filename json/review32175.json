Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Start by saying I really liked The Force Awakens\\, but The Last Jedi is so much better.  Strong\\, emotional performances all around. Incredible action scenes. One of the things that I really liked about it\\, that others may not\\, is that it is the first Star Wars film to pick up right after the end of the previous film.  Will go be seeing it again\\, and again\\, and again . . .","true":true}
