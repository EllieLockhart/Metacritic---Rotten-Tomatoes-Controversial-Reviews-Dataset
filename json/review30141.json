Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad to say this but this was the biggest let down EVER. In other words\\, it\u0092s time for the Jedi and Star Wars to end. What you expected to happen doesn\u0092t happen. The writers portrayed Luke as an arrogant jerk\\, focused too much on secondary characters. By far the worst of the saga and sad to say this but I won\u0092t be seeing Star Wars ep. 9. Disney ruined my favourite movie franchise and everyone will remember this moment.","true":true}
