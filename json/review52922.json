Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredibly deep human story. Every character grows and changes while we encounter one surprising twist after another. I cried several times (never cried in a movie before ). I really connected deeply with the characters and left with a new view of the ups and downs in my own life.","true":true}
