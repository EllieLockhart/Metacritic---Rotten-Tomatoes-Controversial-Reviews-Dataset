Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A few beautifully composed scenes; but other than that small saving grace\\, The Last Jedi was a very disapointing follow up. The Force Awakens gave episode 8 so many potential story lines\\, but this film pretty much said \\\"@!*& that\\\" and killed every interesting plot point to make way for Disney's merch fodder.\\nPlease don't mess up the finale! It's our only hope.","true":true}
