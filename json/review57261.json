Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has a clear agenda behind it\\, and it's not a good one. The movie portrays white men as being evil\\, and goes out of its way to make the \\\"good guys\\\" a cast of almost exclusively women and one black guy. \\n\\nThe movie went out of its way to dump on white men. It made Luke look like a disinterested\\, crusty\\, and jaded old man\\, and made Po look like a traitor by committing mutiny. \\n\\nThe \\\"dark side\\\" contained no members of any ethnic or gender group other than white men. \\n\\nThe Star Wars movie franchise has gone out of its way to put women into strong roles since the beginning. Example: Princess Leia\\, the leader of the rebels and handy with a blaster. Example: Queen Amidala\\, the leader of her planet of Naboo and also handy with a blaster. In fact\\, no man has ever ruled or controlled anything in the Star Wars universe\\, except for the evil emperor.  What more do feminists want? This movie reeks of feminist pandering.\\n\\nI saw it once in the theatre to say that I've seen it\\, but it won't be added to my Star Wars collection and I won't ever watch it again.","true":true}
