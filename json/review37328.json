Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot of this movie rendered every storyline in episodes 4-6 (and Rogue One) totally pointless. The characters we fell in love with accomplished nothing in those movies\\, according to Thr Last Jedi. The Star Wars universe is now worse off that it was at the beginning of A New Hope.\\n\\nAlso\\, why were Rose\\, Poe\\, and Finn even in this movie? Their subplot went nowhere.\\n\\nI loved The Force Awakens\\, but this movie was very poorly written and not well thought out. Overall\\, it's a terrible direction for the franchise.","true":true}
