Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is not star wars... stupid made up force powers\\, a bunch of mary sues\\, and a boring plot.  it gets half a star because the throne room lightsaber fight was cool. hopefully episode 9 will be better because I enjoyed a force awakens and I like Rey","true":true}
