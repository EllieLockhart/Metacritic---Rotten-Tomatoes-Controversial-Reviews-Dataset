Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a childhood Star Wars fan and I've usually found ways to enjoy most of the movies up to this point. I was surprised that I could find none for this one. I still can't believe this movie is what it is. Terrible. Unfortunately it leaves little room to turn back for future installments in the franchise. In fact the movie is destructive to what made Star Wars great and what potential could possibly follow in its wake.","true":true}
