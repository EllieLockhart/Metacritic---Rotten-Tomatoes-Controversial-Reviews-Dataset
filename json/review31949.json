{"101487":169350,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER REVIEW\\nI can't believe I'm about to write a negative review of a film that I have been so hopeful for and ultimately for a franchise that I have loved so much. Just to put things into perspective\\, I am not a \\\"hater\\\" or an \\\"Original Trilogy purist\\\". I had no real expectations for what would happen to the characters in this film and was very open to seeing a new direction unfold. I have watched\\, read and played every bit of Star Wars I could get my hands on since I was a child. I love this universe\\, the good and bad. Unfortunately\\, I must admit that I've never felt so disappointed in a Star Wars movie in my life\\, and yes that includes the prequels. Fundamentally\\, this is a bad movie and the critics should be ashamed of themselves for towing the Disney line with their rave reviews. Let's get started.\\n\\nIf Episode 7 was criticized for anything\\, it was paying too much homage to the original film. It was a \\\"safe\\\" film but mostly enjoyable nonetheless. It was Star Wars and felt like Star Wars that much was certain. It also created a lot of new mystery that leaves you feeling eager to learn more about the future of Star Wars and the many new characters that were introduced. But you can forget about all of that happening in Episode 8. It feels as though nothing is concretely revealed and when something does have more light shed on it\\, it feels hurried and superficial. Episode 8\\, in what feels like a wild attempt to differentiate itself\\, steers completely off course almost to the point of being unrecognizable to the franchise. The comedy was too frequent and felt like cheap fan service from the opening scene until the very end. There were some funny moments but they were ultimately undermined by a barrage of shallow attempts at humor that remove the viewer from the universe and quickly reminded you that you're watching a Disney film\\, in case you forgot. It almost feels like Rian Johnson watched Guardians of the Galaxy and a bunch of other Marvel movies and decided he better follow suit in the self-mockery that those films are so well known for. This is fine situationally\\, but when you poke too much fun at The Force and the Jedi\\, it's hard to take them seriously when you need to rely on them to drive the story. Star Wars humor has always been about the tension between characters or whimsical slapstick for the kids. It never poked fun at its near-sacred foundations of the Force and the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith. These are serious topics for the characters\\, the fans and the saga as a whole. Lucas always treated them as such and so did Abrams.  \\n\\nPlot holes and terribly lazy writing litter the landscape of this film. Let's start with Luke and go from there. Luke's character felt badly written and turned out to be a disappointing take on what was once a resilient and ever hopeful young Jedi. Luke ends up a whiny nobody that quit on everyone and everything because he failed Kylo and his other young Jedi in training. Which actually somewhat works as an explanation for his current temperament when we find him in the film. That is until we discover exactly how he failed everyone. Shockingly\\, it is revealed that the catalyst for everything started with a horrifying moment of indecision from Luke himself. In a flashback we see Luke with his lightsaber in hand\\, hovering menacingly over a young Kylo Ren as he sleeps teetering on the verge of MURDERING HIS APPRENTICE WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE HIS NEPHEW\\, THE SON OF HAN AND LEIA SOLO! Really? He explains that he did this because he saw a \\\"dark future\\\" for Kylo that apparently threatened everything. Kylo\\, of course\\, wakes up to push Luke away and leaves in a justifiable rage\\, killing people and sacking the Jedi temple. This all from the same Luke that would rather die than turn to the dark side by striking his father down at the Emperor's request. This was a brutal turn for the character that was so radically out of place it left the viewer with no chance of being invested in the remaining story the film had laid out for Luke. This was not brave or surprising. It rang as fundamentally untrue to Luke's character and felt like shock and awe simply for the sake of it.\\n\\nLuke's other antics on the island didn't help either. It all starts with the anticlimactic and whimsical lightsaber \\\"toss over the shoulder\\\" once Rey finally hands him the saga encompassing relic. This was completely irreverent and jarring. In retrospect\\, this scene was a good symbol for Rian Johnson's treatment of Episode 8 and Star Wars as a whole. Just \\\"toss it aside\\\" was the theme of the film. To add to that\\, we never hear more backstory about the saber\\, why it calls out to Rey or the \\\"long story\\\" about how Maz finds it. All of the buildup around the saber from Episode 7 is swept aside and left completely unaddressed. Rey ends up swinging it around in a scene as she attempts to train herself since Luke is unwilling\\, but that's about it. Luke\\, in his indifference to train Rey\\, is at one point shown drinking green breast milk out of a bottle that he filled directly from the engorged nipple of some alien creature and having it drip down all over his face and beard. Are you serious? The frog \\\"nuns\\\" constantly on clean-up duty were funny once\\, that was about it. Luke mentions that the froglike creatures have taken care of this sacred Jedi location for millennia but of course\\, we never get to flesh out any of that backstory. Instead\\, the creatures are repeatedly made fun of as Rey and Luke constantly drop bricks on their heads and make messes for them to begrudgingly clean up. The overarching feeling is that Rey and Luke do not pair well together and should have spent much more time on the island training and developing their characters. During the Original Trilogy\\, Luke's brief stint on Dagobah learning the ways of the Force with Yoda was repeatedly referenced by the film as a dangerously short and insufficient training period. Luke was barely considered a Jedi by his mentors and the film made sure to illustrate that there were consequences for being ill-prepared when it came to the ways of the Force. Rian Johnson seems to think that was no big deal\\, however\\, as Rey spends just a couple days arguing with Luke to only receive one brief training session before she's off on the Falcon. The training session consisted of all of 5 minutes meditating on the force. Which would be fine if we had any explanation or backstory whatsoever revealing Rey's origins and why she is suddenly so great with the Force and a Lightsaber\\, but no\\, we get none of that. This potentially crucial moment was also sabotaged by Rian Johnson's decision to inject another comical stab at the Force by having Rey stupidly reach her hand out in front of her when Luke instructs her to \\\"reach out\\\" to feel the force. Luke's moment with Yoda\\, which should have been an exciting reunion for fans\\, was also cheapened by the same tactic from Rian Johnson as Yoda jokingly criticizes the sacred and ancient Jedi texts for being \\\"not exactly page-turners\\\". The point Yoda was making is that Luke needed to let go. That could have been accomplished without the foolish decision to yet again poke fun at Star Wars lore.\\n\\n\\nLuke's great \\\"force projection\\\" at the end was clever and an awesome display of a new power\\, but quickly ruined by the out of place shoulder \\\"dust off\\\" moment that yanks the viewer right out of one of the most critical moments of the film. Oh\\, and by the way\\, he never helps the remaining rebels find a way out of the cave he just snuck in to. No\\, he goes off to cause a distraction and leaves them with a riddle to figure out for themselves. What if Poe doesn't put it all together and quickly get them out the back? Luke's distraction would then be for nothing. Luke's disappearance at the end was also an unsatisfying way to finish the character off. I think Rian Johnson thought it would be a bold move to send him out that way. It wasn't. Luke becoming one with the Force isn't the issue here\\, it's the timing. It felt lazy and reeked of desperation to move the story forward with the new characters. We get it\\, Rian! This is NEW Star Wars and you and Disney want the NEW characters to take the lead. That's fine\\, except those new characters weren't developed at all in this film. Now we have main characters gone and a weak foundation to move forward with the new ones. Episode 8\\, as the middle film in the trilogy\\, ends up sorely lacking in what middle films are supposed to be full of: Character Development. The new characters are already introduced in the first film\\, we needed to keep developing them (and becoming invested in them) in the second. But since Luke had one voiceless scene in Episode 7\\, this was his introduction to the new trilogy and it was too short. This trilogy needed him in the third film to carry the story\\, even if it was as a background character\\, and now he's gone with underdeveloped and meaningless characters left to drag this all into Episode 9 somehow. This leads right into Snoke and Kylo...\\n\\nThe tension between Kylo and Snoke was rushed and lacked substance. Did Kylo \\\"complete his training\\\" as Snoke indicated he needed to do at the end of Episode 7? Who and where are the Knights of Ren? We may never know. Snoke and Kylo don't train\\, strategize\\, or even bond in the sinister and twisted way that would be fitting for the main villain and his apprentice. And just as the handling of Luke's character was abrupt and shallow\\, so was Snoke's. Snoke's death by Kylo came way too soon\\, was very unrealistic\\, and left a huge vacuum in the film that needed to be filled by the evil antagonist to help drive conflict. Not to mention\\, it completely cuts the viewer off from any character development with Snoke. He's a hologram in Episode 7 and a dead man after a few scenes in Episode 8. That's it. He's gone. No explanation of his powers\\, history\\, motivations\\, nothing. How did he organize the remnants of the Empire into the First Order? Is he a Sith Lord? If not\\, that's ok\\, but how did he learn about the Force? What other powers does he have? How did he become so maimed and disfigured? Who knows\\, certainly not the audience\\, because Rian Johnson wants to let the past die\\, which apparently includes any connection to Abrams' Episode 7. Instead of finding a way to be edgy and let the evil stir as they answered these questions and more they simply ax Snoke and let the conflicted Kylo halfheartedly fill the void. That whole turn of events and handling of Snoke was terribly\\, terribly disappointing and severely weakened the film. \\n\\nBut what about Finn and Rey? And what was the thinking behind the subplot with Finn and Rose? Disappointingly\\, any connection between Rey and Finn from the first film is quickly forgotten about and their reunion at the end of the film brought forth little emotion. Finn's escapade to the gambling town with Rose was a cheap excuse to find a way for him to end up on the First Order ship to face off in an anti-climactic \\\"FN2187 vs Phasma\\\" showdown. But hey\\, he got \\\"Chrome Dome\\\"! But guess what? No one cared because no one cared about Phasma. No one cared about her because there was never any reason for us to. Another wasted opportunity to utilize a tremendous actress in Gwendoline Christie. Not to mention the gambling town scenes were filled with eye-rolling statements about the evils of rich people. Didn't you know that the only way to accumulate that much wealth is to be a filthy arms dealer? Most of Finn and Rose's side story felt meaningless and contributed little to the film. I could care less about her trinket and the sister she lost. The suicide mission she died on was a pointless waste and was even called such by Leia in the film. The chemistry between Finn and Rose was ultimately nonexistent and paled in comparison to the great chemistry that Finn and Rey had in Episode 7. They took up way too much screen time and felt like an annoyance that had to be endured before returning to the action.\\n\\nLeia's \\\"flying through space\\\" moment was patently absurd and almost made me laugh out loud but I was too stunned to respond. Instead I sat there in quiet disbelief. It not only looked ridiculous but was completely unnecessary to move the story forward. It was only rivaled in absurdity by Luke's \\\"alien breast milk\\\" moment. We always knew Leia had some latent Force ability but it was never put on full display. In Episode 8\\, Leia suddenly becomes a \\\"force\\\" to be reckoned with as she miraculously survives the cold\\, oxygen-less vacuum of space which was just preceded by her escaping the normally lethal effects of a missile directly hitting the cabin of a ship that she is sitting squarely in the middle of. The rest of the film has her relegated to \\\"police Poe Dameron\\\" duty as she acts like the pestering mother of a troubled teen boy. I think Carrie Fisher actually did a decent job acting for this role but the ridiculous \\\"Marry Poppins in space\\\" moment along with the remaining direction of her character was just too much to overcome. \\n\\nThe \\\"running on fumes space chase\\\" was a bad direction for this story. Why didn't they just turn the ship around and blow up the First Order fleet with their light speed to start off with? On top of that\\, Poe's entire character is basically reduced to one giant lesson in why he shouldn't be such a stupid aggressive man and that he needs to listen to the strong and unique women around him. Except for Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) doesn't give him anything to listen to other than an order to keep quiet and do as he's told. Really? That's the order you give to the most talented pilot and front-line leader the Resistance has? Most of the trouble the fleeing resistance ran into could have been avoided if the Vice-Admiral had simply talked with Poe about their plans. A lot of lives could have been saved. I'm all for female empowerment and love Rey as the lead for this new trilogy\\, but this all just seemed too \\\"on the nose\\\". Watching the great fighter pilot Poe Dameron actually felt like watching a bad dog who is constantly getting swatted with a newspaper. The movie was full of preachy moments that sought to capitalize on current trends and failed miserably to inspire whatsoever. Instead\\, they worked together with the cheap fanservice humor to rip the viewer right out of the universe and remind them that this is Disney and there are statements they need to make.\\n\\nWas there anything good about this film? Sure. Adam Driver did his part. He's a great actor who overcame a lot of bad writing. His ability to convey the conflict\\, rage and betrayal he feels is astounding and only hampered by story decisions from Rian Johnson. Rey was spot on and is very likeable in her role. You just want to root for her and know more about her. She proves yet again that she is certainly a talented enough actress to handle being in the lead role. The tension between Rey and Kylo as they interacted was a bright spot that actually engrosses you in the film for a moment\\, even if it was brief. Frustratingly\\, even those scenes were not able to escape the misplaced and self-deprecating humor that Rian Johnson sought to sprinkle everywhere. The dialogue in the shirtless scene between Rey and Kylo as they telepathically communicated was embarrassing. It added nothing to the film and took away from one of the best and most emotionally gripping aspects of the movie. The action scene in the throne room with Kylo and Rey was pretty cool. Unfortunately we are still left wondering why and how Rey is so gifted in lightsaber combat. She slaughtered half a dozen Red Guardsmen and had to predictably (and annoyingly) save Kylo from another who had trapped him in a headlock. She did all of this despite having only fought with a lightsaber all of two times in her entire life. The Star Wars universe has a well-established lore of lightsaber combat being incredibly difficult to master even for those who are powerful in the force. Lucas explains that the fight scenes with Luke and Vader in the Original Trilogy were full of amateurish sweeping blows\\, indicative of Luke's lack of experience and Vader's aged and infirmed status. That made sense. In the prequels we see what a challenge it is to master the lightsaber and the millennia of traditions\\, discipline and training that are behind being able to master that weapon. In Episode 8\\, it is just something that Rey is apparently able to effortlessly master and that Kylo is apparently not so great at despite the fact that he has been training with a lightsaber for quite some time. And we as an audience are left being forced to accept that without much in the way of explanation. There were some other bright spots. Benicio Del Toro was a lot of fun to watch and played the part of the opportunistic thief\/hacker perfectly but he did little for the story as he was mainly a feature of the pointless subplot with Finn and Rose. You could tell Mark Hamill really tried hard to nail the role and I think he actually did a great job of acting but he ultimately couldn't overcome the terrible writing and abrupt fate they gave him. The rest of the characters were mostly forgettable. General Hux? He was pathetic and Domhnall Gleeson's tremendous ability to act was overshadowed greatly by having his character be the brunt of every joke. I guess you could say the action scenes were pretty well shot and had great special effects. But that is standard for blockbuster films. This film gets no extra points for being visually stunning. That was an expectation. \\n\\nI'll sum it all up like this. Sitting here right now\\, I would rather watch any of the prequels again\\, any of them\\, before I sat through this film for a second viewing. The prequels\\, despite some painful slapstick humor and boring dialogue\\, at least felt like Star Wars. This film was barely recognizable as a Star Wars installment\\, took zero risks\\, and will be the first Star Wars film released in my lifetime that I will not see more than once in theaters. And no\\, making a jumbled\\, disjointed\\, unrecognizable mess that stupidly kills off important characters is not \\\"taking risks\\\". It's bad filmmaking. I am perfectly content waiting until Blu-ray release for additional viewings. None of this makes me happy to say\\, I wish badly that it wasn't true\\, but alas\\, it is. At least for me\\, and for other fans as well as I see the negative reviews pour in. I'm not sure what the mainstream critics see in this film that led them to give such high praise. It's so perplexing that I dare say it almost feels conspiratorial. I never thought I'd say this but I really wish Lucas was still in control. The man created Jar Jar Binks and forced us to sit through his painful dialogue and potty humor and I'm still saying that after watching Episode 8. I've never felt so indifferent to Star Wars in my life after watching The Last Jedi. I think a big part of it is because I'm not confident at all in Disney's ability to do this thing right going forward. Additionally\\, even with JJ Abram's best effort\\, I currently see no way that he can salvage the mess that Rian Johnson created. It's just too damaging. It's almost as if Rian Johnson disagreed with Abram's direction for Episode 7 and sought to make a point by slashing away everything set in motion in The Force Awakens. I wish Episode 8 could be redone entirely. I now have no interest in Episode 9 whatsoever. I cannot believe I am even having that thought but I must admit it is true. This felt like a Disney cash grab\\, a \\\"Marvel-esque\\\" rip off cloaked in Star Wars garb. Disney thought all they needed was space battles\\, lightsabers\\, and furry creatures and we would eat it all up. The Transformers and Fast and Furious crowds will probably like this movie. Anyone who appreciates decent filmmaking or has any love for the Star Wars saga is at risk of being terrifyingly disappointed.","true":true}
