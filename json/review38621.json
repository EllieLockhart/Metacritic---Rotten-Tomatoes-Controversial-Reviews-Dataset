Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars Movie!! I was so excited for this and it was so disappointing. There was too much forced jokes and they didn\u2019t answer any questions from the previous movie. Also the boring Finn and rose subplot which seemed to go on longer than the story with Rey and Luke.
