Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The production quality is good\\, and there are certainly unexpected twists. If that is enough for you\\, then you may like this film. However\\, it sweeps aside all of Abrams \\\"mystery box\\\" stuff from the previous film\\, and it contains multiple scenes which defy credulity. Worst of all\\, it fails to understand\\, and damages\\, the character of Luke Skywalker - the man who believed there was still good in Darth Vader worth fighting for.","true":true}
