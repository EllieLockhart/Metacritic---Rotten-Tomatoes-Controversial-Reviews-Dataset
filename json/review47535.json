Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What should be rich in symbolism like space ship princess Leah\\, the leprechaun ice foxes\\, the little stable boy\\, or how the emo guy kills the most powerful dark lord what tries to pass as brilliant sneakery etc. fail to outlive their obviously exciting introductions. \\n\\nFalls back on old situations and plot premises\\, tugging at the strings of nostalgia are just mildly entertaining. \\n\\nBut it's beautifully shot\\, acting was good and the attempt to create real world heros was cool.","true":true}
