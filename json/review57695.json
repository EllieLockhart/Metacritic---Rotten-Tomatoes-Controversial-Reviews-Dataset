Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ugh....such build up from the previous SW...and then this epic 2.5 hour let down. If you liked Force Awakens\\, you will Hate this movie. It\u2019s like the new director\/writer intentionally tried to dismiss everything in the last movie....and the worst part was the massive let down with Luke Skywalker. No teaching of Rey....no fight left in him....he just gave up....so not in line with his Jedi would respond....especially Luke. Add to that no explanation of Snoke\\, just kill him off\\, no teaching of Kyle.....no explanation of Rey\u2019s heritage....parents were just nobodies and dead....no explanation of how Anakin\u2019s lightsaber was retrieved....Luke didn\u2019t care either\\, and then an over the top attempt to be humorous throughout every scene in the movie.... the only way to make things right is if JJ doubles down and has Rey wake up next to the dark pit on the island...and explains the whole last movie as a bad dream and something that could happen if not corrected....by itself\\, the movie wasn\u2019t bad\\, it simply did a 180 on everything that we were being led to and then jumped into a whole different movie arc.....so disappointed....","true":true}
