Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrahams AND Rian Johnson have RUINED the Star Wars saga!\\nThe Force Awakens was bad.\\nBut The Last Jedi was Twice as bad! \\nI don't even care about any future episodes now....\\nThe humor was in poor taste.  And seemed forced and took away from the film. \\nThe story was not worth while.\\nThe special effects were good. But it is 2017\\, they should be!\\nThat's about the only good thing I can say about this CRAP of a film! \\nAll in all\\, it Sucked!??\\nI'm done with this new leadership!\\nStar Wars ended with The Return of the Jedi!\\nAnd now only lives on in the books....\\nThe Admiral Thrawn books that were written a while back would have been a Much Better Choice than this garbage we have been force fed!","true":true}
