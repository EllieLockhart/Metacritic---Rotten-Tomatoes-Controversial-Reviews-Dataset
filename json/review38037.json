Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The step we need\\, but maybe not the steps many fans wanted. This is an epic movie with unexpected and sometimes even unnessecary moments and storylines. Somehow original somehow a kick in the old ways we know of the saga. I would even say it does not feel like Star Wars anymore.\\nIs that a bad thing? Hell no. For everyone who thought Force Awakens to be a clone of A New Hope\\, this is the new road you hoped for.","true":true}
