Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the criticism of The Force Awakens\\, I believe JJ Abrams introduced some new ideas and interesting characters within the Star Wars universe that left a great space to build on.  While the actors did a good job with the scripts they were given for The Last Jedi and some of the visuals rival anything in any other Star Wars film\\, the plot is does not continue a cohesive story in relation to Episodes 1-6 and even discards the interesting questions\/cliffhangers from Episode 7.  \\n\\nThis review is not about lack of fan service or the lack of realization of a certain theory\\, but just a messy and often boring story that lies beneath the guise of action sequences that make this feel like a large-scale\\, epic movie.  The humor is often misplaced making it feel more like a Guardians of the Galaxy movie\\, rather than Star Wars.  I gave the main protagonist a pass for being so perfect in episode 7 knowing that there were 2 more movies to build\\, challenge\\, and create an interesting character.  I have no issues with her parents not being anyone notable\\, but the lack of adversity that character has to go through has created an uninteresting character that no one feels for or cares about.  Part of the reason that everyone cheered Luke Skywalker on\\, was because we liked his values but he was constantly beat or helped by other characters.  New Hope - Beat by Tusken Raider\\, saved by Obi-Wan \/ attacked by Dr. Evazan\\, saved by Obi-Wan \/ almost killed by Darth Vader during the Death Star attack\\, saved by Han Solo.  Empire - Grueling training with Yoda \/ hand cut off by Darth Vader\\, saved by Leia.  Return - (Probably part of the plan but)saved by R2 at the Sarlacc pit \/ attacked by the Emperor\\, saved by Anakin Skywalker.  The point is that he overcomes tons of adversity which causes us to care and cheer for him; something the new trilogy is lacking.  I love the colorblind casting choices in the movies\\, but the lack of purpose and reason behind each character's journey and choices has raised the question of why they are needed.  \\n\\nWhile there are many more goofy choices that were made in the film\\, I do not want to turn this into a rant.  I believe it was a mistake to write 3 separate stories with alternating directors\\, rather than 1 story divided into 3 films\\, because I think JJ Abrams now has the difficult task of concluding a story that is coherent and meaningful with the direction episode 8 went.  Will not see another Rian Johnson Star Wars film in theatres.","true":true}
