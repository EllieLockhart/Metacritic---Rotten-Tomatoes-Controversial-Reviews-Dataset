Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn't perfect.  There are a lot of storylines.  Too many.  Finn\\, the casino\\, the slowest space chase of all time.  That said\\, I loved Luke and Rey's scenes together.  Kylo and Rey's connection is intense and great.  The arch of every character contributed to the themes of the movie well\\, hope in the face of apparent hopelessness\\, preoccupation with the past\\, dealing with failure and regret.  There were just too many threads\\, too many balls to juggle.  I loved the movie we got\\, though.  So many epic scenes\\, amazing visuals\\, Daisy Ridley is absolutely delightful.  People love to hate and nitpick\\, but this movie was wonderful.","true":true}
