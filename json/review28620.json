Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Progressives took over Star Wars. What progressive points did they make? Should never eat meat\\, all animals are way too cute. Horse Racing is evil and horse owners only get them to race by torture. Casinos are evil and the only people that go there are evil. Rich people are evil\\, and probably made their money doing evil things\\, in this case\\, the all made their money selling weapons to make war. Women are the true heroes\\, followed closely by black men and other minorities. White men are pretty much all evil\/bad. Religion is bad and the Jedi's need to let go of their petty books and history. So they burn all the books and history of the Jedi.\\n\\nSomehow\\, they managed to fit in a story about Star Wars. That part was pretty good.","true":true}
