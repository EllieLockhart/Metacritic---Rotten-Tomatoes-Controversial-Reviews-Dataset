Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was a disgrace to the Star Wars title. There was no redeeming moments. there was kidsy jokes through out the entire movie. The Plot was terrible\\, it lacked any interesting qualities. The acting was terrible. The new characters were very unlikeable. Without spoiling the Trainwreck of a movie\\, I'll just say don't get your hopes up\\, Carrie Fisher's last movie deserves to be better than this. I wouldn't be surprised if she died because she saw what this movie would become.","true":true}
