Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The original and prequel trilogy had their flaws\\, but were each original in both concepts and technology. Experimenting and exploring the strangeness of new worlds was of importance for George Lucas and something he wanted a fresh look at for each trilogy.\\nThe sequels meanwhile bring nothing new to the table. They're shallow action movies set in a rehash of the original setting with nonsensical and character breaking arcs and plots.","true":true}
