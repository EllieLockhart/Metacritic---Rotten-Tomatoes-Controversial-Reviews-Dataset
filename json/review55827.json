Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Post modernist\\, social justice propaganda garbage. Hey\\, do you like star wars? Not anymore\\, The feminist war machine has ruined it just like Marvel and everything else they touch. Do you like strong heroic characters and powerful intimidating bad guys? Sorry\\, we don't have any of those either. We do\\, however have some weak broken men who are either incapable of any type of confidence and leadership or are so sad and defeated they just want to hide in their tree house and pout. We do have some strong women! oh\\, no\\, wait\\, there just as sad and pathetic as they try and fail miserably to be just like men\\, so sad. Where's young princess Leia?\\, Now that's how you do a bad ass female character. Feminine enough to rock a metal bikini while choking the god loving S#%T out of one of the most powerful crime lords in the galaxy. Have you seen the size of Jabba's neck? she's no one to mess with. \\n\\n  Finally\\, and this is the best part\\, after your done knee jerking and cringing at all the embarrassing pro(re)gressive indoctrination that flies in the face of everything that is attractive\\, desirable\\, and respected by normal humans\\, you get to listen to the communist virtue signaling media chastise you for having your own opinion\\, and claiming it's the greatest star wars movie ever and you are a shameful\\,l racist\\, bigoted pig if you disagree. This should go the way of the 1978 Star Wars Holiday special\\, removed and never shown again. Protect your children\\, say NO to the last Jedi.","true":true}
