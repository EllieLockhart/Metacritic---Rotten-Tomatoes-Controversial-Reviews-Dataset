Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 hour of film that could be completely skipped with literally no effect. Surprisingly bad CGI at times. Bad script regarding the resolution of the set-ups from the previous movie. Amazing performances from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. Kylo Ren steals every scene he is in.","true":true}
