Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grew up with Star Wars as a kid and watched those original movies almost every day. Ive probably seen the first three 100 times or more. When I was in college I waited in line for eight hours to see Phantom Menace only to be very disappointed with what we all know was a very bad movie. The feeling I had after seeing The Last Jedi was even worse.. This movie twists everything you love about Star Wars and destroys it. After being off to such a good start with Force Awakens and Rogue One it is a real shame Disney had to make a movie that does such harm to the franchise.","true":true}
