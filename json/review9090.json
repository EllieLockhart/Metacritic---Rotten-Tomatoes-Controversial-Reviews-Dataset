Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of plot holes.\\nThe hole casino plotline can be scrapped.\\nMisuse of characters.\\nDestroying the lore.\\nShould have ended 3 times but kept going.\\nA bad movie\\, filled with ready to buy merchandise.\\nWhy Yoda.....
