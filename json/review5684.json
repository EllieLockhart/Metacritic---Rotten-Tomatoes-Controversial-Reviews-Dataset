Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the critics see the same movie - 0 - and I mean 0 questions are answered and you have ruined the Skywalker legacy.  You gave this guy a trilogy?  Let us randomly drop in new characters and show new force powers for characters yet again with no explanation.  I am done with losing sleep to see new Star Wars movies.  Ruined everything - I am out!","true":true}
