Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time posting. I had to add my voice to this mess because the experience was so disgusting and I want to contribute to knocking the score down as much as possible. I was there from the very beginning in 77.  I do not count the Disney films whatsoever. For me the saga is 1-6.  George never should have sold!  So I'm fine with limiting my experience to those first 6 films.  That's the true Canon in my eyes.  What everybody has stated about the issues with this one is correct. The overbearing political\\, feminist\\, SJW context is there if you can read between the lines.  I hated every moment. The film was an insult to the intelligence of the world. I don't mind female protagonists and ethnic characters as long as they serve the story properly and give equal representation to everybody in an appropriate manner. This was not done here and was so blatant that it was offensive. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! This isn't Star Wars which is supposed to be fun. The franchise was over the moment George sold it. They tossed his outlines in the garbage and now we get this awful crap! I'm fine with loving on George's 1-6. I'm done with these fan film incarnations. Not interested in anything else! So refreshing and proud to see so many voicing precisely what I experienced. 3\/4s of my theater on opening night applauded at the end.  I sat there stunned at that!  I weep for the future.","true":true}
