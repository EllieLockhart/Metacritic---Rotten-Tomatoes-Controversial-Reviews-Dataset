Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why some fans are upset with the movie\\, but I enjoyed it quite a lot.  Thre could have been a little more character development\\, and I hope there is a twist with Snoke in the next film... But I doubt it.  \\n\\nThat all being said\\, I walked out of the movie\\, very happy with the story and the experience.","true":true}
