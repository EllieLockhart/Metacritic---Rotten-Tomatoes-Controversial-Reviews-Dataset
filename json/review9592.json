Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good moments\\, lost in a not so good nor funny film. Some moments that are supposed to make you laugh \\, for me were just very stupid\\, and that is a big fail. And for the next one let's remember that quantity IS NOT quality. One to go to end the trilogy.... and I don't know if to be happy or sad about it.","true":true}
