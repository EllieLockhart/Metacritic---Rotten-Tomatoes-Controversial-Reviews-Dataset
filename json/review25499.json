Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers because if i told anyone what happened they would refund their tickets. Upon first viewing this film is Utter Blasphemy. Great characters and performances destroyed through jumbled plot lines that lead nowhere. Moments that should be epic are made pitiful. Rian Johnson should be ashamed. When the movie ended I felt as if everything I loved about Star Wars was gone. Disney should stop the production of the 3rd film I'm order to save the company from embarrassment.","true":true}
