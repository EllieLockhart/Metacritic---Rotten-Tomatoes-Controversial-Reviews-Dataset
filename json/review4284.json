Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By no means is this a bad movie\\, and certainly entertains\\, however this movie could have picked up where scenes start on the planet Crait and still be able to convey the same plot point; the first 2\/3rds of the movie feel rather pointless with the only significant moment being Snoke's demise and the introduction of Rose. And I dont take issue with anything of Luke's storyline. Its all the others that seem wasteful. With that said...the rest of the movie taking place on Crait was visually and creatively awesome giving the movie the memorable essence to be the classic it should be.","true":true}
