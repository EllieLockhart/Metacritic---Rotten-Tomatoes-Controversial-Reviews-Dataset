Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not completely without flaws\\, Johnson's view of the Star Wars universe opens up a whole new world of possibilities. He's not afraid to take risks that will disappoint viewers for the sake of strengthening the whole franchise. Johnson doesn't rely on unrealistic heroes and traditional Star Wars tropes. He destroys your expectations and creates a new and complex tale about the complexities of humanity\\, emotion and empathy. This is the new Star Wars\\, reminding us of what it was like to be unaware of what to expect in these characters. We in turn are free to be surprised\\, upset\\, laugh\\, cry... it is one of the most beautifully made films in the franchise and gives us much to look forward to.","true":true}
