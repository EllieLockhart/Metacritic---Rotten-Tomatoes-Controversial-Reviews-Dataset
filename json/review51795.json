Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A dumpster fire of confusion\\, and apparent attempt to destroy everything George Lucas and Skywalker related.  Exceedingly disappointed with Rian's attempt to \\\"turn things on their head\\\" as far as fan expectations\\, and film history and story-line.  Rian was soft-balled an opportunity to make something truly amazing\\, yet took that opportunity to make a joke of the franchise.  In a vacuum\\, the movie is not completely \\\"terrible\\\"\\, but this is not a one-off type movie or franchise.  Not sure where all of the \\\"this movie will be darker\\\" descriptions came from\\, as this was more disjointed and disrespectful than \\\"dark\\\". Episode 9 director really has his work cut out to make any sense of this travesty. This is the first Star Wars movie that I will not personally own a copy of.","true":true}
