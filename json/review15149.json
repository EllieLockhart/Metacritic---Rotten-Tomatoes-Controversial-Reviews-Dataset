Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it\\, didn't have much hope and it started boring and predictable but ended in a more interesting way\\, was also great to see the real luke skywalker and princess leia together for one last time (not cgi which they will probably enact a billion times in the future). You cannot expect much from these movies they are above all entertainment for kids. Would also like to mention that Adam Driver makes for a great villain\\, sad but also ruthless\\, there's something truly dark about him that also makes him brilliant.?","true":true}
