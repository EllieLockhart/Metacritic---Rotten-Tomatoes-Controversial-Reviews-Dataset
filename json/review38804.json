Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They did a couple of cool things with the polished turd they were given.  Space Leia was embarrassing.  Luke giving up on Kylo when he never gave up on Darth Vader? Absurd. Trying to make Kylo look sexy? Would have been a better Star Wars movie without Luke & Leia","true":true}
