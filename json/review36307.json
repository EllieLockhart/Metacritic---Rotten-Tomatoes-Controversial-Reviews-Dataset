Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Luke Skywalker rewrite was a total disgrace. He went from someone insisting the most evil and dangerous person in the Galaxy should be redeemed\\, to someone that almost murdered a child that had a chance of being evil\\nBe logical. When you write for a saga\\, write it in a way that makes sense compared to the rest of the story\\, and if you truly want something different that rewrites it that drastically\\, promote new franchises.","true":true}
