Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, seems to be a movie with no grey areas. Either you love it\\, hate it\\, or haven't seen it. Personally\\, I Love It. It has its laughs\\, and fair share moments of surprise\\, as well as the tear jerkers. Some questions will be answered\\, and some more asked. Some answers\\, need no explanation\\, as their stories are irrelevant to the story line. those who are hating on the movie\\, need to go back and give it another watch\\, not because they need to waste more money\\, but so they can try and catch the elements of the story they missed the first time. TLJ allowed me to relive the magic of A New Hope\\, something that TFA\\, just failed to do.","true":true}
