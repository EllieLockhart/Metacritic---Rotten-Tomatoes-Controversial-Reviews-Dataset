Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion it was the worst star wars movie I have seen so far. \\nIt begins as a bad copie of Space balls\\, the force itself just becomes something mundane and overused thing instead of a mystical power wich it is supposed to be and the entire concept of the story is not fitting to the star wars franchise.\\nAt best this is a mediocre stand alone film compared to todays films and franchises.","true":true}
