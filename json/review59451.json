I even went back to playing the first game again to make my feelings more genuine for the TLOU2 and I ended up being more upset towards this new game. People loved LTOU because of the father\/daughter bond that Joel and Ellie had. There were better character development and story that was seamless while in TLOU2 it relies on shock and \\\"surprise\\\". The overall message of the story was entirely predictable and by the end of it\\, I just felt upset that all of this pain and suffering was because the writer's message was something so obvious. Revenge is bad and it can consume you if you do not do something about it. They killed Joel in such a terrible way just as a catalyst to get this predictable revenge story going. What a complete and utter waste.\r\rThis game also does a lot of manipulation to make you feel for Abby and make Ellie look bad but it doesn't work. There is a scene where you kill Abby's dog as Ellie as if you are supposed to care when just before you were killing DOZENS of dogs prior. You are supposed to feel bad for killing someone when you just brutally slaughtered tons of other people right before. The game contradicts its self constantly and it ruins the immersion. You can see the puppeteer instead of the puppet constantly. I really disliked a lot of the side characters as well like Mel for example. Why is a pregnant woman going to the front? How irresponsible do you have to be? Also\\, they even changed a lot of the story like how Joel killed the Doctor. They not only changed his skin color but made the operating room look clean. In TLOU1 the doctor has dark skin and the operating room is moldy and gross.  Made me realize how shoehorned this story was. Joel and Tommy are also a lot less smart for the sake of moving the plot for Abby by being way too trusting and telling everything about themselves. These guys didn't get this far from being this stupid.\r\rLet's talk about the good. The game has without a doubt amazing graphics and animations. The music and sound design are tremendous and it does a great job of creating a terrifying atmosphere when going up against the clickers. I loved exploring the map and having conversations about what happened to the unfortunate. Combat was nice as well and I got a kick out of smashing people's head in with Abby. Probably the only thing I enjoyed while playing as her.\r\rOverall it was a decent game but I can play other games if I want better Graphics or gameplay. I wanted to play TLOU2 for the story and NaughtyDog did not deliver. IMO it was a wasted opportunity to do something better and it could have been handled so much better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
