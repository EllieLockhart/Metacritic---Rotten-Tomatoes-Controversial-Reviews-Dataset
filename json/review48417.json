Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With many daring and unexpected turns\\, this is a Star Wars to remember. many upset that their fan theories are ruined... but that is what made the movie so great. The story was not fan service or predictable. a few tonal problems throughout the first half\\, but that did little to mar the total entertainment of the film. Will see this again in theaters.","true":true}
