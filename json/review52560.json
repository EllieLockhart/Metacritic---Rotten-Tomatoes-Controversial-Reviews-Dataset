Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lackluster story (pretty much just one big chase scene)\\, with a multitude of plot holes\\, unnecessary sub-plots\\, bad characterisation (particularly luke)\\, and terrible writing. Easily the worst star wars movie since episode 2","true":true}
