Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yuck\\, so this is Star Wars for Millennials? In this Star Wars universe you can be born with ability and don't need to train like previous generations. In this Star Wars universe\\, the bad guys are weak minded and ultimately have their parents to blame for their lot in life. Yawn.","true":true}
