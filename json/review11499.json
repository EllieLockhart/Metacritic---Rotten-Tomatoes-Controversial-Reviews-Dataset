Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible movie that pretty much destroys the franchise. Save your money and don't waste it on this crap. Hollywood no longer makes films they make junk create hype and sell junk wrapped in the goodwill of movies of the past.","true":true}
