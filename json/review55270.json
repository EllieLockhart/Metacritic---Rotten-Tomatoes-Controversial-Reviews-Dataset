Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi obfuscates half it's run time with a literally pointless subplot that contributes nothing to the story. The remaining characters from the original trilogy do not get their due\\, Luke's involvement in the story is disappointing to say the least and an insult to poor Mark Hamill. Meanwhile the precious original characters from The Force Awakens remain undeveloped and the film struggles to give them something to do\\, with Poe shining only at the beginning\\, Finn stuck with a pointless subplot that adds nothing to the story and Rey as untrained and unexplored as she was in TFA. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, as you watch this movie\\, you'll find yourself entertained. But once it is over\\, you sit back and realize how utterly meaningless everything you just saw was. Beautifully shot\\, it just has no clear goal\\, except maybe focusing on giving long time facts exactly what they do NOT want.","true":true}
