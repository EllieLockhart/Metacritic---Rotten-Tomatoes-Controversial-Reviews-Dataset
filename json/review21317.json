Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to go see the original Star Wars when I was 8 in a movie theater in Tulsa.  From that time on\\, I was hooked.  I'm not sure why audiences are giving this movie such a poor review.  It far surpassed The Force Awakens and makes room for the new Star Wars generation to take over.  I thought it was a very touching tribute to Carrie Fisher\\, as many of those scenes mean something quite different than before she passed away.  It had great special effects\\, fantastic new characters\\, and an ending that promised more excitement to come.  Much like \\\"Rogue One\\\" it took some time to develop\\, but when it took off\\, it took off.  I feel like they could have shaved 45 minutes off of this film and it would have been better\\, but it was just more Star Wars to enjoy.  I recommend the movie\\, it's definitely worth the $20.","true":true}
