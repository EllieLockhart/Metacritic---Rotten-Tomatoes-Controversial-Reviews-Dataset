Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best way to describe this movie is\\, it's like mediocre sex. It's boring\\, pointless and leaves you unsatisfied. After it's done you are left thinking back to it \\,trying to remember any good parts\\, which are few. It feels more like a filler episode then an actual movie. I still consider myself a star wars fan even though this movie was terrible. I just hope that they listen to their fans for the next movie. And please critics stop kissing ass\\, you aren't helping anyone.","true":true}
