Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take it as a Marvel Action flick and you'll be fine. The action sequences are fast\\, the special effects are grand\\, and the body count is high. \\nCome in expecting a Star Wars movie that makes sense\\, and you'll be disappointed. The plot is very thin\\, the character development is weak\\, and the lasting impression is nigh.","true":true}
