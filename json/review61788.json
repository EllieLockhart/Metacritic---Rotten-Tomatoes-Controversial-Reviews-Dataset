I can't care less about graphics...just finished the last of us part 2 after replaying the first one to refresh my memory on the amazing story anticipating a continuation to the cliff hanger at the end and generally to see more of the amazing duo Ellie and Joel...well I didn't get that...not even a comparable story in quality...Story\\,For me\\, a game is a fun gameplay and a solid story...

A teenage intern? I really have nothing more to say without spoiling...there is a ton of other games with silly stories and who reads this must have seen a movie or played a game with bad writing that goes nowhere but this time the story was perfect and the sequel ruins everything (take Game of Thrones season 8 as an example)...To put it in one sentence: compared to the first one it gets a zero from me nothing more sadly.Gameplay\\, The bad: 6The gameplay is the same with some refinements...it still is clunky and last-gen just looks cooler so a 6 I guess...Graphics\\, The good: n\/aThe graphics are very good...I really don't care though..oh character design is somehow worse than the first one...The last of us gets a 3 from me...oof it's physically painful to say this out loud\u2026 Expand","true":true}
