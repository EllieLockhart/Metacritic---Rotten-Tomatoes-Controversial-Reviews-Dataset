Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, dare I say the critics are clueless and disconnected from the fan base! This move really deserves a half a star but the RT scoring algorithm won't count a half star. In so many ways an honest assessment of this move can be summed up  as\\, \\\"What a piece of Junk\\\"!  Unfortunately I cant get this 2+ hours of my life back that I spent watching this steaming turd\\, hoping it would get better and have some kind of payoff!!","true":true}
