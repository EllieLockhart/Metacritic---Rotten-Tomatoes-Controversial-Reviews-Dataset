Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was good in general\\, but I wanted to see Luke spend a lot more time training Rey.  This would have helped explain why she was so skilled with her lightsaber combat and force ability in general.  The last third was quite good though and I liked the training sequences we did get between Luke and Rey.","true":true}
