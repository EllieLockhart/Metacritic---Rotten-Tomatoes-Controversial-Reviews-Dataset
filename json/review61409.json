Only to have redemption taken away from us right at the end because ellie realizes at THAT! point that the revenge cycle needs to be broken here. Are you kidding me? Abby got her revenge and then some only to have her be shown mercy by ellie. Ellie loses joel\\, almost looses dina to slaughter\\, tommy gets shot in the face\\, jesse gets shot in the head and dies and then ellie leaves dina and their child\\, loses 2 fingers and all this is directly done by Abby so why in the flying F** should ellie show mercy? Honestly made so mad and disappointed at the end while the credits rolled. I couldn't believe I did all that just for some meaningless self realization of \\\"revenge not being fulfilling\\\".\u2026 Expand","true":true}
