Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Look\\, when I first saw the film I came out with issues. It's actually in hindsight that I'm starting appreciate it. There are some aspects I think are still useless (Holdo's role in the film would have a stronger impact if filled by an established character\\, for instance). But the acting is on point across the board (holy crap does Driver bring it this time)\\, it's visually stunning\\, and it really tries to be it's own thing. I might disgree with Rian's vision\\, but if this is the vision we're going to be getting I still enjoy it.","true":true}
