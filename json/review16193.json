Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm having a difficult time understanding the extent of the negative reaction to The Last Jedi. Yes this movie isn't perfect but on whole The Last Jedi is fun\\, daring\\, smart\\, and moving.","true":true}
