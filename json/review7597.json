Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything good about Star Wars was just destroyed by this film. I saw the original in 1977. I have been a huge fan all my life. Every installment has been something I have eagerly anticipated. This movie is just trash and destroys everything good about this franchise. It is so bad\\, I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019d even be able to make a movie about after this one. Other than the fact that by the end of this movie there\u2019s like a total of 16 rebels left\\, I just don\u2019t see how they\u2019d continue to progress the story. This movie felt like they intentionally killed Star Wars. Easily the worst Star Wars movie ever. So not happy right now. ","true":true}
