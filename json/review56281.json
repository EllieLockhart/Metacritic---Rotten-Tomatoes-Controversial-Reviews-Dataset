Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a disappointment. The introduction of a litany of new characters came at the expense of advancing the storylines of the sagas existing cast that moviegoers fell in love with in the The Force Awakens. Further\\, the development of the new cast felt half-witted. In the end\\, the movie failed to present any compelling case for why moviegoers should feel any emotional connection with any of the film's characters despite a 2.5 hour run time. It was clear that Hollywood's stances on today's gender and racial politics played a major part in the film's plot lines. While a lot of politically agnostic moviegoers tend to look past minor incidences of politically motivated screenplay\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi took drastic steps to implement political motivations into the film. The most glaring example of these motivations is the interaction between Poe and Lauren Dern's character Amilyn Holdo. The narrative surrounding that interaction felt quite patronizing. There were several cliche moments in the film that even the prequel movies would have shied away from. The first installment of Disney's Star Wars reboot created high hopes for the second film. Unfortunately\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi failed to live up to the expectations. I hope that in the third film has stronger character development and avoids delving into politically motivated screenplay.","true":true}
