Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Disney\\,\\n\\nAll the mainstream media hand-wringing about the disappointment with this movie being an alt-right troll won't be able to disguise the merchandising numbers.  \\n\\nI hated what Rian Johnson and the writing staff did to Luke Skywalker.  This movie is critical theory deconstructionism at its worst.  Want to trash cultural norms... start by trashing the heroes.  And that is precisely what you've done with Luke Skywalker.  \\n\\nWell\\, I've got four young boys at home.  Four young boys to whom I want to teach values such as hard work and the superiority of good versus evil.  Values which are obviously not reflected in modern Disney media.  Plenty of presents under our tree this year.  But guess what you WON'T find... SW Merch and TLJ tickets.","true":true}
