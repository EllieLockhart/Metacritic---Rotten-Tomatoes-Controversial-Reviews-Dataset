{"101487":106005,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-10-08","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie that is unafraid to look beyond fan expectations to deliver a story that is not only a logical progression of what came before\\, but also capable of delivering cathartic surprises instead of bending to fan-service and or merely delivering what was expected. \\n\\nMost fans take issue with the treatment of Luke Skywalker's character in this film\\, insisting he acted completely out of character\\, however when we look back on his actions in Return of the Jedi\\, and consider how easily his father was swayed into abandoning his good intentions\\, we see that Luke's infractions against his Jedi code and his former heroism are pretty tame by comparison. The film even spells it out\\, his impulse to kill his nephew was there and gone. Somehow this is conflated by some of the angrier members of the fanbase as a legitimate attempt on Ben's life. This is of course ironic as this is Ben Solo's reading of the event. Blindsided and betrayed by Luke standing above him\\, blade drawn\\, Ben understandably assumes the worst. This is what makes the Rashomon-esque sequence of recollections from Kylo and Luke so brilliant. It's a tragedy of misunderstandings. Some fans will never be able to suspect it\\, but considering Luke having nearly lost his life to the ultimate evil\\, one should be willing to humor him for considering an impulse that may well have prevented test evil from returning. Of course we know his actions had the opposite effect. Again\\, therein lies the tragedy. \\n\\nThe other characters are treated with a kind of realism that I think might feel a bit jarring for someone walking into a Star Wars film but I think they work by and large. Poe's journey towards accepting caution over action and accepting responsibility can feel a bit wonky\\, with Holdo being an obstacle to his deception where perhaps just good communication should have taken place. \\n\\nFinn continues from the start on the same quest from the Force Awakens: protect Rey. It's easy to confuse his loyalty to Rey as reverence for the Resistance\\, but all his heroism in the previous film was really just in service of Rey and that continues here. It's not difficult to see why either. He spent his entire life in service of a radical military group\\, unrecognized by the broader galaxy only to flee and become roped into joining another militant group\\, separate from the republic. Finn's journey in TFA was therefore about the discovery of self and making the self the priority as he is humanized by his new friend Poe and is given a name and by extension self worth. So Canto Bight is a bit of a detour but is a teaching moment that grounds Finn away from selfish action and into fighting for a bigger cause. \\n\\nKylo is the real star here. Driver's performance is both nuanced and explosive and speaks to the caustic nature of the character. His bond with Rey is nuanced and toes the line brilliantly between genuine vulnerability and description. He's a character so caustic and conflicted that one could believe he genuinely wants both. Yes\\, he kills his master Snoke and yes\\, Snoke had no back story\\, but it was a necessary move for Kylo and was a cathartic twist to know who we assumed was the master manipulator was the one being manipulated. A satsifying subversion of the master\/apprentice trope and very much in line with the darkside apprentice ascension model in killing his master ala Palpatine and Plagueis. Much like the enduring mystery of Rey's insane innate force ability\\, this will only be a critical error in the larger picture if the choice is not justified and contextualized in The Rise of Skywalker. Given the constraints of the film's runtime\\, we didn't really need any explanation of Snoke's backstory just yet. Being the second chapter in a trilogy\\, it's acceptable that some things remain a mystery. \\n\\nMy only reservations with the film is the detour that was Canto Bight. I think those same lessons could have been introduced in a way that didn't feel so separated from the rest of the picture\\, even though their mission there was of relevance overall. Additionally the humor felt a bit out of place at times and a bit too marvel-esque\\, with some moments losing their dramatic weight after an out of place joke. The humor in Star Wars has never felt quite as punch-line oriented as it does here and it shows. \\n\\nOverall a pretty good film with some essential star wars moments\\, even if there was no proper lightsaber duel. But there's enough new force powers and fascinating character dynamics to make up for it and satisfy this lifelong Star Wars fan. \\n\\n4\/5 \\n\\n\\n\\n","true":true}
