The graphics are as expected from naught dog . In matched . But the gameplay loop and story writing are something that feels like 7 years of solid waiting for this game have fallen short and left this game feeling like a side quest to a story that we will never see . The dynamic of what made the first game brilliant is gone . Killing off characters like it\u2019s game of thrones . Putting a revenge story and making you play as a character not wanted by the fans . And no I don\u2019t care about the whole agenda politics. Strong female leads like aloy from horizon zero dawn are unmatched and widely loved by fans . Setting the bar as you would say. But the writing given in last of us part 2 is just so lazy. And we don\u2019t get to experience what made the first game so successful. The developer just used that success to create this absurd narrative like he is creating the wheel. This game is everything we never asked for . How sad that it\u2019s come to this . I think it\u2019s already safe to Say  this gam Needs to be remade .Playtime: 27hrs Graphics: 10\/10 (Best on ps4 pro)Gameplay: 3\/10 ( the same as the last game but longer)Characters: 1\/10 (who asked for this ) ? Story 1\/10 ( play LOU1 next to LOU2 ) it\u2019s not even the same series. Overall : disappointment and a ending That\u2019s on par with season 8 game of thrones .. 3\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
