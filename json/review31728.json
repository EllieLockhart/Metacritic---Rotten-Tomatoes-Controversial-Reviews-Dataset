Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So so so many droped plot points\\, wasted characters and things that make little to no sence\\, not just in the context of the star wars universe but in the context of the last movie. Really makes me sad to see the death spiral. I went in with excitement having liked the Force Awakens but this movies avts more like a poorly executed fan fic than a star wars movie.","true":true}
