Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a huge fan of the Star Wars Movies jet I felt so pretty bad after watching Ep.VII but many problems that this movie gave to us where fixed thanks to The Last Jedi\\, still not perfect but definitely a very good movie that fits pretty well on this generation and its not the classic \\\"a lot of fights and explotions with good guys and bad guys\\\" movie","true":true}
