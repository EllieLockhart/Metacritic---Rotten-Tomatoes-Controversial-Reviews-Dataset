Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some minor plot inconveniences and a little too childish for my liking. Wonderful sound design and stunning visual effects. Rian Johnson's directing is absolutely astonishing and most of the movie looks like it could be pictures of art in a museum. My only major gripe is I would prefer a trilogy that was more planned out because\\, like the prequels\\, this seems like a completely different movie than its predecessor. I feel Star Wars needs its own Kevin Fiegie to plan out its films better and make the overarching story work in the long run.","true":true}
