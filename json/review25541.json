Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Spoilers: While some might not like this fresh new direction for Star Wars\\, this is the one that finally sets us on a path for the future instead of living in the past. \\\"Let the past die\\\" was clearly the battlecry of this film and we are all the better for it. Ignore the haters\\, in time they will come to see the truth. It is a shocking film\\, very different from what I expected\\, but in all the right ways.","true":true}
