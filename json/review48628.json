Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst disappointment of the year i loved the original movies because they had heart and real stakes but these new Disney movies have none of that. Story is awful the main character is the definition of a mary sue and they destroyed Luke Skywalker. Also it seems anyone with criticism to this movie is being called out by Rian Johnson as being trolls or sexist which is very immature and just makes your audience hostile it makes no sense and Disney should do a better job and focusing on pleasing the fans not pandering to just a liberal audience.","true":true}
