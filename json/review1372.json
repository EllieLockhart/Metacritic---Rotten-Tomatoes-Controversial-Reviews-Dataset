Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a 10 year old I\\, along with my 8 year old brother\\, had our childhoods changed by Star Wars. Star Wars was an adult film\\, and we loved it. This was no Apple Dumpling Gang. This new movie is a deconstructionist\\, ant white male manifesto dressed in the universe that WE created as we sat in the theatre over 20 times. How dare these people hijack this movie for their own social justice crap. Once again\\, something built by males is taken over and ruined by females and male feminist manjinas. Mark Hamill was right about the movie and he tried to warn us. That was NOT Luke Skywalker. It was a caricature of a powerless grumpy old white man who is bested by a girl with no training. What. The. Fuck. On behalf of a 10 year old boy and his little brother\\, sitting in a theatre in 1977 ( without a single girl in sight)\\, fuck you.","true":true}
