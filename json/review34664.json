Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The complaints are overblown.  Aside from a weak new character (Rose)\\, and a little too much filler in the rebel half of the plot\\, The Last Jedi is an excellent Star Wars movie.  Kylo Ren has become one of the franchise's best characters\\, Mark Hamill is amazing in his return\\, and Rey and Finn develop in believeable ways.","true":true}
