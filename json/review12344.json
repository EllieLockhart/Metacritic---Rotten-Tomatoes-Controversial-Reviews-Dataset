Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am taken aback about what issues people had with this movie. It is an overall excellent film I thought. It was fun and engaging and felt like a live version of a episode of the Star Wars Rebels cartoon in a way. I think people were looking for a twist like Empire Strikes Back had in it. In a way\\, it did but it was bold in that it made it feel like less of a soap opera and more like a real universe. Haters gonna hate I guess\\, but I think people should see this one.","true":true}
