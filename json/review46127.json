Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals are amazing\\, story is incredibly poor. Every plot point set up in The Force Awakens is squandered\\, and there is no reason left to see Episode 9. Questions were hand-waved away. Ill-placed humour ruins the delivery and seriousness of scenes. The plot is such a shambles a 10 year old questions it. There are no stakes. Attempts to subvert expectations are throughout the movie\\, and mostly just miss and feel anti-climactic. With one short explanation from a certain purple haired character\\, most of the bad things in the film would be avoided. At least it's a pretty light show\\, even if it's ruined the trilogy\\, managing to feel like it is going too slow with meandering around during what should be a tense chase\\, yet rushes things trying to be a redo of both episode five and six all in one. Oh\\, and Leia is Mary Poppins. No. No I'm not joking.","true":true}
