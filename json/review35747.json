Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is definitely better than any of the prequels and is a solid good movie but it doesn't surpass the force awakens or any of the originals. The movie will give a fan everything they want in a Star Wars film but in my opinion falls short of having that awe impact that the originals and force awaken gave me.","true":true}
