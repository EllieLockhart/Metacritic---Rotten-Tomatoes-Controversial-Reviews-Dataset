Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what everyone's problem is. I loved it (38\\, lifelong Star Wars fan. I have tattoos...)\\, my wife loved it (passive fan)\\, my kids loved it (11 and 13). Like any movie\\, it's not perfect\\, but it's new and different. If you're not one of those fans that just wants more of the same\\, you'll enjoy it too.","true":true}
