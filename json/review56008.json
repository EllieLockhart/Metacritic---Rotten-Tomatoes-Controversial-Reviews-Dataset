Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Seriously\\, if the movie is not going to remain faithful to the series why calling it Star Wars in the first place? Just change the name and say \\\"It is inspired by Star Wars\\\" or something. This movie has 1% of the essence of Star Wars. It doesn't deserve any stars. I was so excited when I found out about this movie and it was such a disappointment. (btw I saw the movie a long time ago but I am making a review until today because... why not?)","true":true}
