Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a bad movie\\, not a mediocre one\\, but a really\\, really bad film. It's so bad that I have a suspicion that Disney is paying people for positive reviews. The dialogue is hackneyed\\, filled with ham-fisted platitudes\\, and overly drawn-out. The biggest problem is that the poorly written dialogue is absolutely necessary for the film because none of the story is told visually. Every reveal (other than one minor one near the end) comes as a result of someone literally just saying exactly what was revealed (and most times someone else says the same thing a few minutes later). There are multiple painfully amateurish\\, first year film student-type visuals that are meant to be breathtaking and profound that just come off childish. The most charitable interpretation of what happened with this script is that Rian Johnson let a 12-year-old relative write it for him. There is no way a professional adult wrote this film seriously.","true":true}
