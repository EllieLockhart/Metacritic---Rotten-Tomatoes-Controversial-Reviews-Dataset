Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a mess that movie was! It's all over the place. Weak and lazy writing\\, major plot holes\\, useless character arc and an obvious political bias that simply doesn't belong in entertainment. Sometimes\\, it even falls into propaganda.\\n\\nSpecial effects and music are great though. But that doesn't save the rest of the production.","true":true}
