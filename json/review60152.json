From great powers comes great responsabilities then Neil Druckmann and all NaughtyDog decide to push forward the meaning of videogame as an interactive medium with themes and connections between other medium like comics movies and music that has been just barely touched in indie games and never in AAA games in this deep way. The only negative thing that i'm a little sad about is that the public wasn't ready for such a brave change and because of this we can't all share the impressions and the love that such a great storyline and character development deserves because the vast majority of people that are playing videogames are just a bunch of ignorant babies and fanboys\/groupies for characters but i guess that if you sold 4 millions copies in 3 days is fair that some people will be offended and will spread just hate. Thanks for changing my perspective about videogames once again!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
