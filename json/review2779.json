Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful messy and silly - not even just a bad star wars film\\, just one of the worst films I've ever seen - there's not 1 good thing I can say about this film other than I wish I hadn't watched it","true":true}
