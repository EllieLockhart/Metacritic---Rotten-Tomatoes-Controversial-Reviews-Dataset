Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the new\\, more humorous approach to Star Wars. All of the plot points and character motivations made a lot of sense to me. And now that the rebellion has the new lightspeed ram tactic\\, I'm looking forward to watching them dominate the empire in the next movie. I give it five bags of popcorn and one bottle of pink hair dye.","true":true}
