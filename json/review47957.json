Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it has some tonal problems and an unnecessary subplot\\, this movie has more than enough jaw-droppingly inpactful moments\\, both visually and emotionally\\, to make up for any editing issues.  This film seems to understand the concept of the Force better than any Star Wars movie since the original trilogy\\, and explores it in a new and exciting way. The character development for all the major players is at the same time natural\\, surprising\\, and thematically charged in a balancing act that is very hard to pull off but is for the most part executed flawlessly here.","true":true}
