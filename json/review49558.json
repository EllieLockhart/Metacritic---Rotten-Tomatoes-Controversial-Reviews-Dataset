Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow! I was so disappointed in this movie that I'm actually going to write a review. This was a slap to the face to the fans.  If the movie was the first of its trilogy I would understand a few things but making so many random things in a middle of a trilogy was just a bad move. At this point I don't even care for episode 9 (I'll probably watch anyway) but I don't care about Rey anymore. Anyway\\, this movie really left a bad taste in my mouth.","true":true}
