Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The biggest disappointment and let down. The movie was so disconnected and didnt flow at all. It was confusing and made little sense. I feel like they put forth little to no effort in making this movie. They ruined lukes character\\, poe and general hux were the complete opposite of how they were in TFA. Snoke was possibly the biggest let down of the whole movie. So many plot holes and unanswered questions. The special effects were crap in parts of the movie. Yoda was garbage. A long awaited movie and a huge let down. The critics may have loved it (not sure why)\\, but its clear that the fans are hating it. Just look at the audience score. Attack of the clones was a better movie. Thanks disney...you actually managed to ruin star wars. Please bring back J. J. Abrams.","true":true}
