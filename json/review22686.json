Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like most\\, I watched this film with hope (which is the point of the series) and my expectations slowly began to clip away.  Parts that were meant to be funny came off as awkward or sad.  Parts that were meant to be dramatic and moving made the entire audience laugh hysterically.  Decades of lore were tossed aside and characters were permanently defamed for the sake of...  I don't even know how to finish that sentence other than \\\"marketing ploys and political agenda\\\"  This was not a failure\\, it was a deliberate middle finger to the star wars audience.  I would say that \\\"I'll never see another Star Wars movie\\, but the fans have made some impressive and moving films in the past and I'd rather the effects in a film suffer than the lore\\, characters or logic itself like this movie has.  This film is easily the worst in franchise history; And yes\\, I have seen the Ewok movies.  Just like Resident Evil\\, this is a franchise that will survive only in small indy or animated films among the fans.  This film isn't meant for fans; Its meant for children to enjoy the flashy effects\\, buy the merchandise\\, and soak up the idea of complete moral ambiguity that this soulless film has shown to promote.\\n\\nAside from Mary Poppins\\, the effects looked great.  I'm sorry to say that the musical score fell victim to the infernal noise of the dialogue and ADD-like location or tone transitions.  This film might be fun to watch in 2x speed to some Benny Hill music\\, but imagining it as part of the SW cannon is ridiculous.  I could go into vivid detail about all the problems with this film\\, but it looks like others have done a great job of that already.  I am not a robot or a part of any political party;  If you love Star Wars or the history of it's characters\\, please don't ever watch this film.  The evil empire (Disney) knows how to hurt you!","true":true}
