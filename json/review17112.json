Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie immensely.  Yes\\, it did not feel like every other Star Wars movie\\, but that's a good thing.  We can't expect all the new movies to be a rehash of past movies.  For this saga to continue\\, it needs to evolve and do the unexpected.  That is exactly what The Last Jedi did and did it well.  It was not a perfect movie\\, but it was one heck of a ride and had some of the best moments in the saga.  Great Job Rian Johnson and the cast and crew.","true":true}
