Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It'll take me a few more watches to really appreciate it fully but this by far exceeded my expectations. It was an emotional roller coaster balancing the humourous jabs and roiling turmoil that befell our favorite characters. This film really competes with Empire\\, I thought I'd never get to say that. As a side note\\, it really hit me hard seeing our princess again with her powerful and commanding presence on the bridge of her cruiser.","true":true}
