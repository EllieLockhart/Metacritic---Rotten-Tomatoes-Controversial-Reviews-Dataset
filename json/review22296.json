Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi has many great scenes\\, but still mediocre. Humor fell flat many times. Many scenes were drawn out. Last Jedi was as boring as the prequels were. Just because a movie is long & has a dozen twists doesn't mean it's good. Shouldn't have to walk out of a movie theater wondering if I liked a movie.","true":true}
