Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful continuation of the Star Wars saga.\\n\\nWhere Episode VII introduces us to the new trio who will be front and center throughout the new trilogy\\, it is Episode VIII that shows us who they really are. Each character is tested throughout the full length of the film\\, not only against their enemies in the First Order but\\, more essentially\\, against their own flaws and misgivings. We experience these trying moments alongside our newest and oldest heroes and the fascination we learned in Episode VII gives way to real love. As someone dear to me said\\, it is a movie about meeting our flaws and failures with courage.\\n\\nAlmost as critically\\, Episode VIII upends the questions Episode VII left us with and it does so by providing us with the answers we need\\, if not the answers some may want. This movie is nothing but answers earned after hard exploration and so the only question it leaves us with is \\\"What happens next?\\\" Which is\\, in a time where predictable twists whose sole purpose is to pander to an audience raised on having their most shallow theories held up as equal to actual creative work\\, exactly the question a story of this calibre should be leaving us with. It tells us everything and leaves us knowing nothing\\, with the promise of more to come.\\n\\nEpisode VII was a good Star Wars movie\\, truly a good one\\, but Episode VIII is the first truly great Star Wars film in a long time.","true":true}
