Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not formulaic in the least\\, and that's pretty much what everyone else is bitching about. It seems being surprised and having the rug pulled from under you\\, being kept in suspense and then seeing how nothing went the way your jaded\\, trope-riddled moviegoer brain thought it would is a bad thing. I certainly loved it\\, was thoroughly entertained\\, thrilled\\, and pleasantly surprised about seeing a different face of my favorite franchise. Refreshing\\, tense\\, and somewhat meta truth be told. Awesome movie\\, I really can't wait to see it a third time sometime next week! Star Wars is love\\, people. Star Wars is life!","true":true}
