Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing movie exploring the complexities of good versus evil heavily laden in the theme that black and white is neither balanced nor an accurate depiction of the universe or humans themselves. It nicely points the series towards a more \\\"grey\\\" area and hints at how balance will finally be brought to the force by eliminating absolutism.","true":true}
