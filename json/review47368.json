Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What can I say... I feel the force fantastic way to see some major changes in this my childhoods favourite movie... Can't wait to see it again and again... I'm definitely going to get it on blue rae as soon as I can","true":true}
