Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dislike the movie in every way it is not Star Wars it's a cool sci-fi flick but it's not Star Wars it contradicts everything about the Star Wars Universe + Rian Johnson went in a whole different direction it let down key plot points that could have been used in a better way very big disappointment in this movie","true":true}
