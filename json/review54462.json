Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it... I might be one of the few\\, but I really appreciated the radical directions. Showing us some new things was exciting and I feel like it really worked. I'm glad this isn't just a retelling of the original story. I really liked a lot about this movie! Then again\\, I didn't get into much speculation. Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this so much. I didn't have preconceived notions nor expectations about what should happen. Easily 5\/5 stars for me.","true":true}
