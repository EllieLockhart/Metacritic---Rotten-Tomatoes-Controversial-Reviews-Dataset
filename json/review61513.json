We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I'll not give it blatantly 0 or 1\\, but believe me - critics are overrated this game. The Last of Us and Left Behind expansion was a shooter game with decent zombie outbreak theme. There is tons of games out there with that\\, but what this game did better than those was story telling. It wasn't a masterpiece\\, unlike most of the people says - the tie between Joel and Ellie developed slowlyI'll not give it blatantly 0 or 1\\, but believe me - critics are overrated this game. The Last of Us and Left Behind expansion was a shooter game with decent zombie outbreak theme. There is tons of games out there with that\\, but what this game did better than those was story telling. It wasn't a masterpiece\\, unlike most of the people says - the tie between Joel and Ellie developed slowly and once it should be strengthened\\, it happened instantly. Nothing can be perfect\\, I know but a masterpiece shouldn't have problems like that - especially when it's main focus is story telling. Aside that\\, game was just a shooter\\, with optional stealth if you want. Believe me\\, there is tons of games does that part even better. There was puzzles\\, and they were boring because set on moving a platform a lot.\r\rI really tried to avoid spoilers even with the first game\\, so here's what's about the Part II. Storytelling is awful. Only good thing I say about story is how it's presented and some of the characters are lovable. Aside from that\\, there is tons of plot-holes\\, unnatural behaviours\\, lazy writing and inconsistency. Once you completely finish the game\\, I think developers want you have a bitter taste but hell\\, you get a stale taste and say why those people done this? and most likely why critics gave this 10\/10? I'll not give any spoilers\\, but imagine whole story development and character's life choices doesn't even matter in the end. Unlike Part II\\, the whole story development was key point in the finale of the first game.\r\rGameplay is almost identical\\, with smooth improvements and better AI. Sound design? Awesome. Musics\\, decent enough. Graphics? I expect more tbh\\, especially from a Sony Exclusive game.\r\rLet's talk about politics\\, game isn't fully loaded with LGBTQ+ but sometimes the privileges given on \\\"that one\\\" character will bore you. Unlike most of the other people\\, I played Left Behind and I know Ellie is lesbian. I'm a crossdresser as well\\, so consider it came from a \\\"non-binary\\\". The problem isn't representing it\\, the problem is making one character overrated\\, who represents that culture.\r\rWell\\, seems like the score I give is only and ONLY for game engineering and like I've said it's not something truly unique. If the main focus is story of the game\\, it should impact scoring more than other games. 4\/5 is for simple\\, enjoyable gameplay and good voice design. Musics and graphics are not that much of good so they doesn't impact rating for good or bad. Story and character development - literally zero\/5.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
