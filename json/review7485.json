Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even with the title \u00ef\u00bf 1\/2~Star Wars\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM) it wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t what I expected. Reverse on lore\\, too many politically correct view points force onto viewer\\, why does Rey not require training? Two movies in and no explanation\\, too fluffy\\, what happened to the dark undertone of the franchise? Real shame.","true":true}
