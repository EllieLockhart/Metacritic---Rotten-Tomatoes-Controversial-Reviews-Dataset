Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such waste potential. Rian Johnson has trashed Abram's vision for this trilogy and has left episode IX in shambles that could possibly ruin the franchises future. \\nFilled with an unecessary side story\\, plot holes\\, wrong Luke Skywalker\\, discarding of important character backstory\\, and no questions answered and just more piled on.\\n\\nHopefully Abrams can save this trilogy in episode IX from its doom.","true":true}
