Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well made POS.  As Mark Hamill has said that was not Luke Skywalker.  While I was already skeptical about a return of the empire which completely renders the original trilogy pointless\\, this film was the last straw.  It was made by someone who clearly has never been more than a middling casual fan and his lack of affection for the universe's ethos and characters was evident.  the fact he was even entertaining having Lando play the traitorous DJ part shows he has no business making an SW film.  He took the decent setup from JJ and threw it out the window.  the sequilogy is now a Seattle Amtrak bounding towards a 30mph bend","true":true}
