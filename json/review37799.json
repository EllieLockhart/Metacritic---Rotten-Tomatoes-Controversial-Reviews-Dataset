Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were just too many questions and plot holes that just sunk the movie for me. These include:\\nHow did Maz Kanata get the lightsaber?\\nWhy doesn't Rey need to train to be powerful?\\nHow did Finn and Rose escape after crashing in front of the new AT-AT's?\\nWhy would LUKE spare Vader yet try to murder his nephew AND become a recluse?\\nWhy would Luke need to hide so deep if he could project himself all over the Galaxy?\\nWhy would Luke bother leaving a map?\\nHow did Leia fly like Superman?\\nWhy wouldn't people lightspeed kamikaze earlier in the saga or more often in general?\\nWho was Snoke and why was he so powerful?\\nWhere were the Knights of Ren?","true":true}
