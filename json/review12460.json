Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe what Rian Johnson did to Star Wars. He has destroyed it. We waiting decades to finally see Luke Skywalker on screen again and he turned him into a hobo without the hope and enthusiasm he once had. What  happened to the chosen one prophecy? How come everyone and anyone has force powers now? Why did the lightsaber call out to Rey in episode 7\\, then it get tossed over a cliff? Why all the parallels to Luke only to be told Rey's parents were nobody's? I could go on and on and on. Btw\\, the cantobight bit was a complete waste of time - since when does animal cruelty get talked about in Star Wars? Han Solo cut open a Tantan to keep Luke warm in Empire! Chewie ate a porg within the same movie!!","true":true}
