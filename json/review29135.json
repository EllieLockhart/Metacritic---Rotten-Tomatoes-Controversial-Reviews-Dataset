Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really wanted to like it\\, and watched it a second time. Fundamentally a horrible movie. Take the star wars name out of it\\, and all the emotion on both sides. It was an awful movie with wasted character dev\\, poor story\\, and completely unnecessary plot holes. Lazily written\\, and for all of the resources and legacy at their disposal\\, Disney should be ashamed.","true":true}
