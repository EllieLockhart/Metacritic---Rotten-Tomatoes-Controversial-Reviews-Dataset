Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must admit I was disappointed in the story line-particularly as relates to Luke's character. Considering killing his apprentice and nephew while he sleeps. Really? That's not Luke\\, that's a disregard for the Star Wars canon by Rian Johnson. The juvenile humor was forced and cheapened the experience. There were so many missed opportunities to develop relationships and backstory's from TFA\\,. Instead we were given unnecessary diversions from the main story and characters. The whole casino trip was a waste of time\\, and the simplistic dispatching of Snoke was silly. Who was Snoke anyway? He couldn't sense betrayal or a lightsaber. Silly. And if all it takes to destroy a First Order Flying Fortress is ramming a cruiser into it\\, just use a bot and be done with it. So much opportunity\\, squandered.","true":true}
