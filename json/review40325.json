Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  I am a Star Wars fan.  My Dad took me to see the original in 1977.  In every Star Wars film I have felt a sense of excitement.  In this one\\, I felt bored and insulted.  It was so sexist and racist.  All the men in the film were shown to be stupid and subordinate to all the women - and I mean ALL.  They had their faces slapped\\, stun gunned and were laughed at.  All the bad characters were white and male (except for Phasma who is hidden by a mask).  All the good charters were female and from various racial backgrounds.  Where's the diversity?  It really carried the narrative that white men are all evil or stupid or incapable of doing anything without the help of a woman.  This is just pure sexism\/racism and is not something we should be teaching young children.  Feminists complained about sexist movies from the 50s yet here they are making the very same mistake.  Star Wars you can keep your sexism and racism.  You've lost me until you get some egalitarian writers who can construct a coherent narrative.","true":true}
