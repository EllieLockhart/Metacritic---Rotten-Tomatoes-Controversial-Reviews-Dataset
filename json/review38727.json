Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The writing was horrible. There are multiple glaring plot holes. There are entire plot lines that should be cut. They ruin one of the series greatest characters by completely ignoring his established traits. His arc looks like a redemption arc\\, but falls totally flat with a horrible twist ending that ruins any satisfaction you would get from it.","true":true}
