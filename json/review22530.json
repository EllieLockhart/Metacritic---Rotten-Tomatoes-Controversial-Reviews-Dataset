Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lets dispel some myths\\, shall we? First\\, we are not \\\" haters\\\" or \\\" trolls\\\"\\, just because we don't like your movie. Secondly\\, there is an argument that Star Wars fans complained that Episode 7 was too similar to Episode 4\\, but that we complained again when 8 was too different. We WANTED different\\, but a movie still needs to be good. Third\\, \\\"Well just look at the box office! Its enormous! That many people can't be wrong!\\\" That's absurd. Star wars could make a 15 minute movie about hamsters receiving shock treatment and the logo alone would sell the movie. So please\\, defenders of a rotten film\\, please stop. You are embarrassing yourselves. \\nNow\\, on to the movie. With the exception of Mark Hamill\\, and D. Ridley\\, the actors in this movie felt like an old episode of Suite Life of Zach and Cody. Or any other mid 90s afternoon schlock. The acting is that bad. From the opening with Hux\\, who is more like a 30s mustache twirling cartoon villain that evokes no dread at all\\, through the PETA release of the animals and all the following political statements\\, well\\, we have had enough. The audience opening weekend was 58% male\\, 62% over 25\\, yet Kathleen Kennedy has said she doesn't give a damn about us. So\\, heres your score and richly deserved. \\nNow on to Luke. You left us without a word from him in 7\\, and resolved it like this in 8? I cannot express how poorly the original icon of this series was dealt. I will try not to get into spoilers. \\nHopefully\\, there are some rational people out there reading these at Disney\\, whom will never let Kathleen Kennedy near another Star Wars project for the rest of her life. \\nAnd to you\\, reading this\\, just because I don't like this movie\\, at all\\, and feel betrayed and shit on\\, it doesn't make me less educated\\, or tolerant. I am not a racist or xenophobe. I am no troll\\, I don't hate. Disney has decided to crap on an entire generation of Star Wars fans to sell Porgs and Disneyland tickets. \\nBTW\\, I DID see this movie.","true":true}
