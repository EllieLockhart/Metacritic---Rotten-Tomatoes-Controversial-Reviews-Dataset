Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what has disney done to this series.  Everyone we wanted to see finish out the story is gone.  We have new characters no one cares about.  Is anyone scared by the new darth vader replacement?  What is the point of bringing like back if all he does is sit on an island.  Just about as bad as it gets.","true":true}
