{"101487":156370,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No Major Spoilers\\, just quick discussion of plot points\\nThis movie seems to be really splitting the fan base\\, and the audience score should be a clear cut sign of that. I walked out of the theater absolutely hating this movie. Not only does it fail miserably as a movie in itself\\, but it is un arguably the worst of the Star Wars franchise. \\n\\nI have always been the kind of person that goes into movies understanding that there is a possibility of plot holes\\, and I generally allow them to slide by as long as they are not absolutely ridiculous. The plot holes in Last Jedi are not only lore breaking\\, but will make you face palm as you constantly say to yourself \\\"Dear god why don't they just do X\\, and their problem is now solved.\\\" I understand that for the most part if you look at any movie ever made you can pick it apart\\, but there has to be some kind of line that cant be crossed. \\nThis movie revolves around two different plots\\, the first being that the First Order fleet is chasing the Resistance fleet\\, cant catch up to them because apparently all of a sudden Imperial ships are slow (Even though in the original trilogy we have Star Destroyers keeping up with the Falcon) so they decide to wait tell the Resistance runs out of gas. That is not a joke. That is the plot. Instead of attacking the one ship with what I can only imagine is 100s of Imperial Fighters\\, calling in for another ship to warp out of hyperspace near the Resistance ship\\, Admiral Way To Young to Be a Officer decides they will simply chase them until they run out of gas\\, while continuing to fire their weapons at said ship\\, even though the ship is apparently out of range to do any damage to the rebel ships shields\\, even though Kylo Ren and two Tie Fighters in the previous scene somehow blew up the rebel ships bridge with the shields still on it\\, but now for whatever reason the Empire cant launch all its fighters because the rebel ships turrets would wipe them all out\\, this makes zero sense. \\nThe second wonderful plot line we have going on is Rey and Luke doing nothing on an island for three days.  When I saw Force Awakens I was confused as to how Rey was able to do everything she did throughout the movie\\, but I also wasn't jumping on the whole \\\"Mary Sue\\\" bandwagon. Well if you felt that way about her in FA\\, it only gets worse in this one. Not only did Disney apparently forget how the Force works\\, the fact we have 6 movies explaining and showing us how it works\\, or the multiple other cannon sources going over stuff like this\\, none of that apparently matters anymore. Rey is absolutely perfect\\, because #Reasons. \\nWithout spoiling too much\\, just go on youtube and type in Mark Hamill hates last Jedi. Watch the multitude of lovely interviews of Mark talking about how he 100% disagreed with everything they did with the character of Luke Skywalker. The Luke in this movie\\, is not the Luke from the original trilogy. Im so sorry Mark that this is what they made you do. #NotMyLuke\\n\\nThe humor in this movie is off\\, Star Wars is not Marvel Disney. The action in this movie leads to nothing\/is too short. The plot is terrible and serves only as a purpose to move the characters from point A to B\\, your characters should be the ones moving the plot\\, there is a difference. You will walk out of the theater realizing that nothing got accomplished outside of the list of original trilogy cast slowly being killed off.","true":true}
