Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! An exhilarating send off to our dear Princess\/General Leia!!! Today's technical advancements have finally caught up to give these newer Star Wars movies just what George Lucas tried to do when envisioning them in a galaxy so long long ago!","true":true}
