Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is basically Visual over substance . And really awful in term of pothole  quantity . There is no continuity with the rest of the saga not even with the precedent movie .No matter how good the actors are the characters are just hollow . Even luke was mistreated . Basically the whole appeal of the movie is that there is some thing there and there that are unexpected but unexpected doesn't mean good .\\nI wish I could unseen this but I can't .","true":true}
