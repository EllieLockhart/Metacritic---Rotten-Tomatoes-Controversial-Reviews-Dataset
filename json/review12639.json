Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand why disney chose to go in the direction they did - the \\\"everyone is a hero\\\" message is nice and popular. But Star Wars is a fairytale\\, and fairytales have heroes. Luke Skywalker is an archetype\\, and this film completely betrays that archetype; it is absolutely against Luke's nature to become what he did. The throw-away villain of Snoke is massively disappointing. Phasma should have died in the trash compactor. It would have been nice for a scify film to have had just a bit more respect for\\, ya know\\, science (*cough* Leia *cough*). John Williams\\, as always was remarkable. The fight scenes were beautiful\\, and the cinematography\\, overall\\, was excellent (although there he use of red\\, black\\, and white to carry the theme is a little been-there-done-that). I will see the next one\\, but a lot of the magic is gone now. And isn't Disney supposed to be big on magic?","true":true}
