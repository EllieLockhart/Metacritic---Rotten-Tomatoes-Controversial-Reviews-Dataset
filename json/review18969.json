Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's been a while since a movie made me this viscerally happy. The movie has the true heart of Star Wars - not like Force Awakens\\, which was a carbon-copy of a SW movie\\, or Rogue One\\, which was a dishwater drab war movie\\, with blatant\\, inappropriate call-backs in place of that SW magic. The movie respectfully ties up a lot of the stories from the original trilogy\\, and even deconstructs some SW cliches (finally) in preparation of new trilogies to come. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are brilliant and the new cast puts in a great performance. The visuals are stunning\\, battle sequences are impactful (there is even the best lightsaber fight scene ever put to film in this one\\, they did the samurai roots of the Jedi proud). Even the ending is a wonderful little moment of meta-narrative perfection\\, with a new generation symbolically taking up the mantle from the old. \\n\\nWhile I loved it\\, I can recognize that the movie isn't perfect - there is a twenty minute-or so stretch of the movie in the middle that\\, while visually splendid and original\\, is both gratuitous and does little but disrupt the flow of the movie. I get why they did it\\, and I appreciate some sentiments of the scene (it grounds the war narrative a bit)\\, but it was a pace killer. All jokes elicit at least a chuckle (and some are side-splitting funny)\\, but their inclusion sometimes feels to have been a Disney mandate to keep it light. Porgs\\, anyone? Finally\\, Adam Driver's character has a satisfying character arc\\, but it falls short of making him a tent-pole villain that will make us excited for the third movie. None of these parts come close to overpowering the whole for me\\, but looking at the audience score\\, they did for a lot of people. Disney beware\\, but also keep going in brave\\, new directions.\\n\\nI am going to see the movie again\\, definitely. As I said\\, it made me honestly happy to have seen it and I hope it did the same for you. May the force be with you\\, always.","true":true}
