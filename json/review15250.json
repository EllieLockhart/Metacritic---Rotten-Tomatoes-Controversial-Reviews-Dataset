Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked this movie more than \\\"The Force Awakens.\\\"  As middle chapters go\\, I'd rank it on a par with \\\"Empire Strikes Back.\\\"\\n\\nI'm not sure why the SW Nerds are so unhappy with this movie.  Its Star Wars\\, not rocket science!","true":true}
