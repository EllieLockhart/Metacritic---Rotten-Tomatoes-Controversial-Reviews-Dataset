Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely atrocious. Zero character development of old characters and new characters add nothing except token diversity which is why critics are obligated to praise it. By the end of the movie we are in the exact same place with nearly everyone. There is a dead-end side plot that is utterly pointless and adds an exhausting 30 minutes. Humor lands part of the time but even when it does it is the wrong tone for this or any Star Wars movie. Unnecessary plot twists for a plot I couldn't care less about. I liked a lot of the creatures\\, but it's never been so obvious how many were included just to sell stuffed animals. SPOILERS: This is the only film in the franchise without an actual lightsaber duel. Story requires ForceSkype to move forward. Characters of Poe\\, Finn\\, Snoke\\, Leia\\, and even Luke mostly wasted. Unanswered questions from TFA are addressed anticlimactically here. I could go on; I would rather watch Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
