Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Shit\\, it actually annoys me the lowest I can give it is half a star.. \\nthis film is filled with huge plot holes and has an entire portion of the.

Seriously what were they thinking? Rey is no one\\, snoke just dies with no back story. Luke is just hiding squatting in a hut? Not training or seeking out enlightenment.
