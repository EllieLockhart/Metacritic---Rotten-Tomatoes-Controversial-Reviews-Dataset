Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The central action of the movie is devoid of tension and stakes\\, allowing none of the intended \\\"powerful\\\" moments to feel earned. Rian Johnson seems to have forgotten to explain WHY the characters make choices\\, and only focuses on WHAT they need to do to progress the story.","true":true}
