Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney & producers pat yourself on the back!!!  Great job you just made a bad Star Wars movie.  Kudos on a great combination long and boring.  It does have some cool visual\\, and a few clever-sounding lines\\, but that is about it.\\n\\nTried to watch a second time\\, just stopped after just a short time.   Just a really bad movie\\, with a bad story.","true":true}
