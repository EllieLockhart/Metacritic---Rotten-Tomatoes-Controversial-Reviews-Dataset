Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the director of the dark knight told heath ledger .I do not value your opinion and and i need no input or suggestions from you.How would that have turned out 'terrible' thats how. I think we all know thats what happened they devalued mark hamill. You broke the mans heart for a complete mess of a movie . Boo to you Disney boo to you .","true":true}
