Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi\\, remember that this film is part 2 of 3\\, you get some stuff answered not much it raises new questions.\\n\\nExcept for the \\\"Darth plagues\\\" story in Revenge of the sith and the original trilogy (where everything had to be built) NO ONE FILM adds as MUCH to the LORE to star wars than \\\"The last Jedi\\\" does.\\n\\nIncredible work\\, it has elements\\, nods and a few echoes to both other trilogies but it is NOT slapped in your face like it was with \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\n\\nFinally everyone and just remember the Writer and director are the same person Rian Johnson and he loves to screw with your mind!\\n\\nDON'T\\, believe EVERYTHING you see or EVERYTHING  you hear in the film some is misdirection!","true":true}
