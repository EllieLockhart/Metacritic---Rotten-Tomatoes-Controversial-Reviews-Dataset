Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted opportunity ??\\n\\nTFA set up so many storylines\\, plots and confrontations and the Brian J. was just like Nah I don't really care about them\\, I'll make my own movie.\\n\\n*Who was Snoke? Never found out\\n*Luke S. Jedi training Ray.... not really\\n*Snoke did nothing!!! just died like a bum\\n*Ray just learn to fight like a Jedi in half a day... really? so why did Jedi ever need apprentices? \\n*What happened to the knights of Ren?..... crickets\\n*Captain Phasma was soooo underused... I think she just appeared for 2 mins\\n\\nThese are just some of the reasons I didn't like this movie\\, too bad I really wanted to like it. \\n\\nLet's do better next time","true":true}
