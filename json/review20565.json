Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never been so disappointed with a Star Wars film. Cringeworthy attempts at humor\\, disjointed plot\\, terribly underdeveloped characters. The only thing consistent about this film was it's fumbled attempts. It was 2 and a half hours of smashing your foot on every coffee table imaginable.","true":true}
