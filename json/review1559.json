Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan\\, I have never been so disappointed. Though the actors tried their best to give something to their fans\\, especially from Mark Hamill\\, It suffers from bad writing and directing from Rian Johnson. Who appears to ignore what the fans want. Disney\\, if you want to continue making these movies\\, I'm all for it\\, but you better rethink your approach. You owe it to the fans\\, Hamill\\, Lucas and Fisher\\, god bless her soul.","true":true}
