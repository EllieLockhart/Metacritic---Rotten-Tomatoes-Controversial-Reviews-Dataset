Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was nice but was exactly like v episode only difference kylo Ren wipe the old era","true":true}
