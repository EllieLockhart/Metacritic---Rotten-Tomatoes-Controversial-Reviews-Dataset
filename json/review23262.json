Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"LOVED IT!!! I wish I could write my whole review with emojis! It is the VEST Star Wars movie EVER! Super Phresh! Rian Johnson is a genius and this movie will win SO many Oscars! It is a Star Wars movie for the Millennials! Amazing storytelling and Rian developed all the new characters and plot lines while honoring the history of the original trilogy. I luv the new characters\\, especially Rose and the little animals were SO adorable!!! I have seen it 3 times already and plan on seeing it at least 6 more times! I can't wait for the next movie. I think Jar Jar will return and ze\\,\\,Rose\\, and Mary Sue will be busting some 21st century girl power and destroy the evil crakr-nazee patriarchy!!","true":true}
