Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solidly fun movie. Different movie in its scale. No Star Wars movie has ever taken place so quickly after the previous film nor has one taken place on such a short amount of time. It\u2019s not a perfect Star Wars film\\, but it\u2019s a solid Star Wars film. Events in the film make me sadder about Carrie Fisher\u2019s passing. I hope they simply recast the role so that we can see Princess Leia\u2019s story. I will say I\u2019m not a big fan of the comedy infused into the franchise lately\\, but that seems to be what is happening in most of sci-fi\/fantasy genre. ","true":true}
