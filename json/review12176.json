Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am another one of those people who created an account just to express my extreme disappointment in this film.\\nAs a long time fan of the star wars movies i had been looking forward to seeing this movie in the cinema only to be let down with a pathetic cash grab by Disney.\\nSo many plot holes\\, pointless subplots and so much SJW nonsense.\\nThis movie does no connect coherently with the previous star wars movies or its characters.\\nFor example Luke Skywalker is turned into a coward and a weirdo\\, NOT Luke Skywalker.\\nThere is now nothing left to be excited about in the Star Wars franchise as all the new characters are boring or infantile.\\nDisney has killed Star Wars and shat on its grave","true":true}
