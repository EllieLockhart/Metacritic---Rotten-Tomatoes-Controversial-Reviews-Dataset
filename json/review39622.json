Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This has some moments\\, but my god\\, what's up with the screenwriting how can you make a movie work where the theme is about failure.  Seriously\\, virtually everything everyone does is based on failing.  Entire tracts of the screenplay are littered with plot and character arcs that accomplish nothing.","true":true}
