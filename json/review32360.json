Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is by far my favorite franchise and I wanted to like this movie. However\\, it seemed more like a loose Marvel Movie than a Star Wars movie. The actors did a great job with what they were given to read\\, but the movie failed to provide character development for some of the most important protagonists. My expectations are of course much higher for a Star Wars film\\, but I was disappointed because it felt sloppy and rushed.","true":true}
