Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually it was beautiful. Tonally\\, and thematically it was terrible. The plot doesn't make sense and the characters motivations were just awful. Rian Johnson is a terrible starwars director and the management that let this travesty over the finishing line clearly dont care about starwars as a whole. Ruinef the future of a great story. Well done disney\\, well done. ","true":true}
