Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RJ took a massive dump on previous plot lines set up in TFA\\, what Luke Skywalker means to franchise\\, and to Star Wars fans everywhere with this garbage. I've never left a theater angry\\, until this movie.","true":true}
