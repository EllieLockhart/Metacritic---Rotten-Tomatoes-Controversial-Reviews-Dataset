Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just terrible. I can only base that on the 3\/4 that I could sit through. Only the third time I have left a theater\\, the other two being Battleship and Meet The Spartans. Also both garbage. So inconsistent\\, full of plot holes\\, didn't go anywhere or do anything\\, terrible jokes\\, characters acting out of character. Just junk and I don't care to watch the end as it's finale was reported to be a toy commercial. How the mighty have fallen.","true":true}
