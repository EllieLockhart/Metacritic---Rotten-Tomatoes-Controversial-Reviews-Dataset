Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Irrelevant characters\\, questionable plot decisions\\, more plot holes than pot holes in Michigan roads\\, and an entire pantheon of dei ex machina. I desperately wanted to love this movie but Disney quenched my dreams.","true":true}
