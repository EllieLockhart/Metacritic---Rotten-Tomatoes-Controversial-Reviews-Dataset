Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is this even Star Wars? Why have you ruined my childhood Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Rian Johnson ? How in the world can Luke be hopeless when he was The Hope in Star Wars...Why would Luke try to murder his pupil Kylo Ren in his sleep behind his back with a light saber because he saw some darkness in him but had hope for Dark Vader and Vader being one of the most iconic villain bad ass darkest Sith Lord? Forced humor\\, plot lines and character development a mess...I could go all day but the handling of Luke Skywalker after waisting 30 years to see this character on screen was just insulting. Finn and Rose story up there at Jar Jar level and completely pointless. I gave half a star cause visuals were great...the story was written by somebody who doesn\u2019t know Star Wars. ","true":true}
