Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and I'm sorry. It seems as if the filmmakers were so focused on cool visuals and clever-sounding lines that everything else suffered. There are plot points that don't make sense\\, dramatic scenes which are undercut by out-of-place humor\\, and inconsistent characters. After the prequels\\, I felt like The Force Awakens was a step in the right direction\\, but this movie is a big stumble backwards.","true":true}
