Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually signed up for a RT account just to shit on this movie. \\n\\nBeing a life long Star Wars fan I couldn't believe my senses. This is hands-down the worst Star Wars movie ever made and it really just craps on and erases all of the other movie premises and characters. \\n\\nRian Johnson is an immeasurable asshole who should be ashamed of himself. There was nothing new or daring about this mess of a \\\"script\\\" or movie. It was just a lazy shit-on-everything that WAS Star Wars festival. He must hate the other movies and George Lucas.","true":true}
