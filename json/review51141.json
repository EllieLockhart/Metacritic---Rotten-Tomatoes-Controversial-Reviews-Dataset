Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely horrible. Maybe among the worst movies I have ever seen. Makes the prequels actually seem good. It's like whoever made the movie never watched the previous movies all the way through\\, just went off getting the general idea. Not even in comparison to the other Star Wars movies. It's just bad. Hollywood has ruined my childhood. Transformers\\, GI Joe\\, you name it. Ruined.","true":true}
