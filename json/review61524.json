The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First off I would like to say\\, this game is technically very impressive.  Not only are the graphics and sound top notch\\, the production values are off the charts.  Which was to be expected from a first party studio.

Not only are the graphics and sound top notch\\, the production values are off the charts.  Which was to be expected from a first party studio.  Not only that\\, even the new character animations and rigging are also excellent.  Characters move very naturally and transitions are almost seamless through most animations.  As for the controls themselves\\, this game hasn't changed much since the first LOU.  However\\, the writing and storytelling are quite frankly just terrible.  You can't build characters over the course of an entire game\\, and then just for the purpose of clunky storytelling\\, have them act in a manner that is completely contrary to their personality as we know it.  It's so bad\\, that the game is just hard to play\\, and at times you just have to turn it off.  And without getting into spoiler territory I will juist say\\, the ending is atrocious. Anyway I don't see any need to drag this review out any further than necessary.  Because this game is so technically impressive\\,  I would give it probably an 9.5 out of 10\\, based solely on the graphics and sound.  However\\, the controls and mechanics begin to become a drag pretty quickly.  Being a story based game\\, where the storytelling and narrative are such an important aspect of the game\\,  that is what really brings the score on this down for me.  I would literally give the story a 2 out of 10.  If you really enjoy the basic mechanics of this game\\, and you are not invested at all in the world building or characters int this game\\, then you might get more enjoyment out of this.  Or if you've never played the first game\\,  these problems may not seem as obvious.  I feel ok giving this game a 5 out of 10\\, again\\, because the game is so technically impressive in some areas.  Despite the narrative flaws I find in this game.  I've tried to go into this and be as objective as I can.  For everybody review bombing this\\, quite frankly I think the game is more than a 0 to 2.  That's is a bit disrespectful\\, and disingenuous.  Perhaps it is also a bit disrespectful the way they chose to treat their established characters in this story.  As I stated before\\, if you are not at all invested in this story or characters\\, this game might be a 6 to an 8 for some people\\, based purely on it's technical achievements. Just wanted to add my 2 cents.  Maybe this review will be helpful to somebody.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
