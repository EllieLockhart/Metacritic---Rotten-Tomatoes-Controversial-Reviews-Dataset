Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was 6 years old when A New Hope came out\\, I grew up on Star Wars toys and homemade Halloween Costumes. Short Answer: I loved The Last Jedi. It isn't perfect. I found a few parts a little cringe-worthy. But\\, those are kinda part of the experience. It is beautiful. And so much fun. Go See It!","true":true}
