Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter trash. The plot is a mess. Rey is a snooze. Finn is a filler character. Laura Dern... purple hair does not make you interesting. Luke learned to act\\, but his scenes with Rey lack direction\\, drone on\\, and are just boring. And Leia learned to fly! Lmao... space ice queen flying through space\\, what a joke. Force fly... I can\u2019t. The only highlights are Adam Driver and Benicio Del Toro. Otherwise\\, what a sad film. They keep trying to create \u201cmoments\u201d whether humorous\\, dramatic\\, etc but they lean in so hard and we don\u2019t care about these poorly written flat characters. How\\, with all the money poured into this thing\\, is it impossible to make it good?? Final rule: Snope\/Snape\/ET should not be CGI. No character with a speaking role should be CGI! It boggles the mind how CGI is getting worse with the passage of time. Oh and the Bond villain ginger lmao. And Poe who? I fucking can\u2019t. Mess!","true":true}
