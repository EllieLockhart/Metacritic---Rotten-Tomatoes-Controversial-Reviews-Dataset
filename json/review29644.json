Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson single handeldy ruined everything about Star Wars\\, the Jedi\\, the lord and the events before TLJ all because he wanted to kill the past. Mary Sue is apparently the most powerful force user that has ever existed in the galaxy. Don't even get me started on the treatment of Luke\\, how everything in that movie went against what we knew about Luke. This move has tainted everything lore wise that has come before. I just can't anynore. Star Wars died in 2017. The only good Disney Star Wars is Rouge One.","true":true}
