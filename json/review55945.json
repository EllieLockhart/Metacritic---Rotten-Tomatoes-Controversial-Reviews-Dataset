Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson ruined the whole Star Wars Universe with only one film: The Last Jedi is a farce\\, a parody and extremely badly written. Tones of plot holes and cringeworthy humor. This film leaves not only a very bad taste in your mouth\\, it also makes it impossible to care about future Star Wars movies and what is even worse: the old Star Wars movies are highly damaged by this film. Rian Johnson should never make a movie again - he should sell Burgers or run a Cleaning Company\\, but should  stay away from directing any movie anytime! ","true":true}
