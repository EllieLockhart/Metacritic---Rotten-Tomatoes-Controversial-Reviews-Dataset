Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I truly think that the backlash this movie is receiving will probably be forgotten after the next one is released.  I love the movie; it was very entertaining and it definitely sets itself apart from all of the other SW movies\\, but I for one do not want more of the same.  All of the gripes (and there were only a few) I had have settled-down since seeing it for the first time\\, but the main two things I was frustrated with (What happened to Leia\\, and what happened to Luke) I now believe were put in motion for the third film.  My hope is that once that movie is released\\, this one will be vindicated.  Although Empire is [probably] the most well received movie in the series\\, it was not universally liked upon it's release.  People often forget that.","true":true}
