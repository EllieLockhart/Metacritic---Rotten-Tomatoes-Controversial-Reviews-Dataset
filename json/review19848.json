Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was awesome\\, stylish with the right mix of funny and sad moments and that certain Star Wars magic. I love the diversity. It's not catering to some \\\"PC agenda\\\"\\, its just a more accurate reflection of a galaxy that also contains women (including those of different ages) and people of different skin colours and ethnicity. Having representation of these groups in such kick ass roles is powerful. For the people out there that are fuelling the backlash because its overly \\\" PC\\\"- I would imagine that you have never missed seeing someone like you on screen doing inspirational stuff. You don't realise how awesome it is because you've never felt the lack.","true":true}
