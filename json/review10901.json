Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated this film. TFA set up many plotlines That this movie just throws to the side like trash\\, i didn't enjoy it. As well as it Disregards already established Lore.","true":true}
