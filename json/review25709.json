Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as the Force Awakens\\, but decent none the less\\, although I do feel the story telling was very rushed and never gave you a chance to identify with characters\\, and the usage of Matt Hamill was an absolute waste\\, a shame this will be the last movie Carrie Fisher is remembered for as the film could have been so so much better.","true":true}
