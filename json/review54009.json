Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I came out of this movie...depressed. I keep hoping for something original and creative that embodies the same character complexity of the original movies\\, and this film was the furthest from that I've seen. With the exception of Adam Driver's performance (the character is convincingly petulant\\, yet oddly charismatic) every character is bland and one-dimensional. The plot is a true suspension of disbelief at every turn\\, and the whole direction of this next trilogy is uninspired. \\n\\nMaybe I'm asking a lot from a movie series that has become\\, essentially\\, just a go-to\\, boxed-in action flick\\, or an audience that is more swayed by bubblegum simplicity wrapped in special effects and dumbed-down humor\\, but why can't someone make a NEW Star Wars movie?\\n\\n The Star Wars universe offers so many possibilities to tell a good story that's not just a rehashed version of the originals. At this point\\, despite being a die-hard Star Wars fan growing up\\, I've lost hope that the story will ever be good again. I couldn't wait for this movie to end\\, and I don't think I'll be watching any more.","true":true}
