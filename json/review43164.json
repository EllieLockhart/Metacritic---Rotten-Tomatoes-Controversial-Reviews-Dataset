Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This rewiew contains spoilers.The last Jedi was a solid movie with some good scenes but it had its flaws. I didn't really care about canto bright side mission and i think Finn's sacrafice could have been opened the door to new possibilities but no\\, Rose had to save him from ensuring to resistance win. I think that Luke was coward making his force clone or whatever and Leia's force flying thing was wierd to. But i did like the effects and locations and some elements of the story. 3\/5","true":true}
