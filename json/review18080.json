Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Jedi! Great action\\, phenomenal cinematography\\, and a nice expansion on what we understand about the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson did a great job with this one. There are some story elements that are weak or unnecessary but this comes with any Star Wars movie. I encourage anyone who is interested to see it for themselves and reach their own conclusion. Fun Fact: Empire Strikes Back was initially received with mixed reviews but now it\u2019s considered the best film in the entire Star Wars saga. ","true":true}
