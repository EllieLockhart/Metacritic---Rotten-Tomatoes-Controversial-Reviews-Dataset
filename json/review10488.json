Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"great special effects\\, horrible story.  Honestly\\, consider this as a teenage boy watching the 4\\,5\\,6 I wanted to be Luke.... Who would a teen age boy want to be from The Last Jedi?  The EMO dark guy? The Rage dude? the Guy the spent the whole movie trying to undermine the leaders?  The guy that is a coward and is trying to escape?.... That's it for male figures.  Throw 50% of the population (the same ones that are majority SF fans) and have at least one man hero.","true":true}
