Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Im gonna give it a 0\/10 you know why? Because im mad with the official reviewers that give it a 10.... If u wanna lie to us right in the face so bad like we are 10 year old kids then right back at you....ofcourse its not a 0 but lfmao a 10? Killing Joel in 90min ? And then you leave me with a a spoiled **** called Ellie ?That is \\\"pissed off\\\" with Joel for saving her life the last 4-5 years?? Most of the characters empty with no interest for the viewer if they gonna live or die.... You wanna get a 10\/10 give me an Option to pick what will happen in the end. And for all those who say the scrit was so deep that gives us messages about society and all? What is this joke? What messages? about what? That violence is bad? So you give me a splatter for 25 hours so that in the last 5 minutes i will understand that violence is not the solution? Did all that we played and rated the first game 10\/10 became Warlords? Anyway im pissed 7 years for this u should of respected the fan base more than a fast story full of modern cliches about violence \/ sex orientation and identity etc\\,... you risked you failed simple as that... 4\/10 for the graphics and sound\u2026 Expand","true":true}
