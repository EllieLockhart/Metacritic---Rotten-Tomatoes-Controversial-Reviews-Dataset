Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What bothers me the most is not the amount of plot holes\\, not the sloppy storytelling\\, not even the lame Superman-like scene. It's not the fact that entire characters are only made to appeal certain demographics or to sell action figures. It's not even the forced\\, constant\\, over the top comedy that keeps us from taking anything seriously. It's not that the amazing actors in the cast (Gleeson and Serkis above all) are either used poorly or not used at all. It's not the cheap critique to society in the middle of the movie\\, or Benicio del Toro's uselessness. It's not that one of the most iconic characters in movie history is basically ruined by this script.\\nWhat really kills me is seeing something special and unique becoming something prefabricated\\, serial\\, something we've seen so many fucking times before. This movie somehow succeeds in putting together the worst mistakes that Marvel and DC movies keep doing. And people fucking love this shit. Star Wars dies like this\\, \\\"in thunderous applause\\\".
