Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you put all the Star Wars issues aside\\, you're left with something that isn't even a good movie. This review isn't because its a \\\"bad Star Wars\\\" movie\\, its just a terrible movie that happens to be a Star Wars. I am a huge Star Wars fan: I go to SW Celebration\\,  I cosplay Star Wars\\,  I've defended Jar-Jar which is saying a lot. This movie took everything that TFA set up and literally throws it over the shoulder because it doesn't care or want it.","true":true}
