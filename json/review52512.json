Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A horrible ride that feels less like starwars and more like a progressive agenda it spits in the face of the classics and george lucas will never enjoy star wars like i used to.","true":true}
