Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've loved Star Wars for almost 40 years and that includes Phantom Menace (Jar Jar excluded). I was more excited for The Last Jedi than any other because of the many different ways it could go with the multitude of cool characters they had\\, including the star of the show\\, Luke. I watched it alone opening day b\/c my wife wouldn't let me dismiss our oldest son from school.  When it was over no one in the theater spoke. It was like a funeral. That night my son asked when I would take him to see it (our tradition for Rogue 1\\, and Force Awakens) and I told him we wouldn't be going. Now it's out on video and I still can't bring myself to watch it with him. I'm not sure if it's because I don't want him to be as disappointed as I still am or if I'm just afraid of how bad it will make me feel again. I know it's just a movie but it's very special to me and I've felt such a connection to it my whole life. I feel so sad about The Last Jedi\\, like something was taken from me that I'll never get back. I'm just still so stunned that movie was allowed to happen to the franchise without someone at Disney saying \\\"we can't release this movie as is\\\".  I personally rank The Last Jedi as the worst movie I have ever seen due to the gap between my expectations and the reality as well as the damage it did to 8 previous movies and future movies to come.","true":true}
