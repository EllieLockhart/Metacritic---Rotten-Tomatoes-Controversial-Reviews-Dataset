Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm starting to get sad there were any additional Star Wars films ever made. With the exception of Rogue One. The rest are plagued by average writing and this film is emblematic of another lazy effort in a multi billion dollar franchise. ","true":true}
