Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am an avid SW fan and have been looking forward to this next installment of SW and found myself supremely disappointed. I unferstand wanting to move on from the \\\"Skywalker\\\" arc of the story but continually dwstroying the true essence to what SW is to give us new isnt a good way to do it. The story is rushed\\, the charractor plots are rushed and the older SW charractors are sent out the door in a way that is not true to what SW is. This movie was also over disneyified (to much needless comedy force into the script). As much of a fan as I am\\, I am now not looking fwd to the future of what SW is becoming. Here is to hoping that this soon becomes better then episodes 1-3.","true":true}
