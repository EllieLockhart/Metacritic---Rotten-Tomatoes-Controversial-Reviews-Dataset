Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Garbage-tier film. Rian Johnson ruins beloved characters to \\\"subvert expectations\\\" while adding nothing but a ham fisted\\, preachy\\, disjointed trainwreck. an unfettered disaster that has ruined the star wars universe.\\n\\nAnd this latest smear campaign\\, painting disgruntled fans as \\\"racist\\\" \\\"Sexist\\\" \\\"bigoted\\\"\\, etc is a shameful\\, desperate attempt to fool the public at large into thinking only old\\, white men are hating on these films. Well Disney\/lucasfilm\\, people of all walks of life see through your lies\\, they see through your latest shill campaign to pump up this mess of a film\\, and they will no longer stand for it. you are hemoraging customers left and right. you have lost myself and my family forever. we will never pay for another product you deficate out and try to jam down the throats of people who just wanted quality\\, where you give them nothing but condescending tripe. \\n\\nit is only going to get worse for you. this has only begun.","true":true}
