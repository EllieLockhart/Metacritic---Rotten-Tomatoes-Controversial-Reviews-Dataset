Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Honestly\\, where to begin. The Last of Us was a breathtaking game. Storytelling was done masterfully. I still tear up whenever I see Sarah's scene.\rThat game managed to get you so attached to characters to the point of it being the downfall of the sequel.\r\rTLOU2 greatly improves the gameplay mechanics of the first game\\, albeit the mechanics aren't that great to begin with.\rIt's still very polished and highly enjoyable at first.\rIt gets stale very very quickly\\, unfortunately\\, but that's not too much of an issue\\, because TLOU was never about gameplay.\r\rEnvironments and music are out of this world. Hats off to all the people involved. They did an astounding job and every set piece was a beauty to behold.\r\rUnfortunately\\, all of what I mentioned is overshadowed greatly. These were all overshadowed by abysmal writing and storytelling.\rI did not mind Joel dying. That was expected.\rThe how is questionable but what are you gonna do..\r\rThis story feels incoherent. Dismantled. Trying so hard to break the shackles of a cliche revenge story\\, it ends up shooting itself in the foot.\rI did not care for Abby or her friends. I really didn't. Naughty Dog got us attached to Joel and Ellie\\, knowing well that they're flawed. Knowing well they're not the best of people. We loved them anyway. Trying to show us how bad they are doesn't work. It's a post-apocalyptic world where every man is for himself.\rWe cared about their relationship\\, not Abby's and her new friends. Playing her angered me beyond belief and letting her walk free without being given any choice made me feel like I wasted so much time. The game is hollow.\rThe characters are hollow and their choices don't make sense.\rIt's like the characters were made to fit the narrative they wanted and not the other way around.\rI expected a big portion of the game to talk about \\\"the cure\\\" which is what made the first game what it is\\, but there was nothing.\rOnly a very brief mention in a damn flashback that brushes off the whole thing as minor story point.\rI personally believe that finding a cure should've been the main focus of the game\\, with the revenge story being a subplot of many.\rUnfortunately\\, we can't change what has been done. Naughty Dog failed to deliver a good story. They tried a bit too hard and stumbled on their own ego.\r\rFinally\\,\rGraphics 10\/10\rGameplay 6\/10\rStory 0\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
