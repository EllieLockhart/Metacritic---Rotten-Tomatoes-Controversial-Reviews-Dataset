Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much better than Ep VII\\, which I still say was just a reworking of IV.\\nNeeded more of the Ray\/Ren\/Luke storyline and less Finn and Poe.\\nWhile the movie is a little bloated and still familiar (yes\\, you will continue to see scenes and beats that we've seen before)\\, it does successfully steer the audience to exciting\\, new territory.\\nStandout performances by Hamill (the best portrayal of Luke in the series)\\, Driver and Ridley.\\nExcited for VIII.","true":true}
