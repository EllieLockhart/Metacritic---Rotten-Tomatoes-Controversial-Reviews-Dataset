Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remove the Finn\/Rose pointless subplot from the movie and maybe this is worth a damn. So much potential here absolutely wasted for God knows why. If you're going to build up a movie with plot lines from The Force Awakens\\, please ACTUALLY use them and don't completely scrap them in the sequel. For a movie that picks up right where TFA left off\\, it feels like a completely different journey to absolutely nowhere.","true":true}
