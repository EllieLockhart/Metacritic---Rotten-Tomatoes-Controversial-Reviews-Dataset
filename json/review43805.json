Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was very disappointing for a Star Wars film in which the audience looked for answers to the questions from The Force Awakens. Many of these questions have either stupid answers (Rey's parents) or are not answered at all (who is Snoke?). Rey is the ultimate Mary Sue in that she knows how to do everything better than anyone\\, and there is a horribly boring and stupid side quest with Finn and a new character named Rose. Rose may be the worst character in a Star Wars movie since Jar Jar Binks came along. Poe Dameron is still flawless and you never get a sense that he could be killed throughout the entire movie. The visuals and score of this movie are great\\, but the story-writing\\, uninteresting new characters\\, and gaps in the plot ruin what could have been an amazing movie.","true":true}
