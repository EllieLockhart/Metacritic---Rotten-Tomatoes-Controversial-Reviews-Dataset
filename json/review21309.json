Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in with very low expectations. And was still dissapointed. Terrible plot\\, even worse casting\\, and pretty bad acting. The one redeeming factor\\, and the only reason I gave it 1 star instead of 1\/2 of a star is because of the action scenes. Every scene change I hoped it would end\\, but it just kept going. Also\\, I'm not quite sure they understand the physics of space... Honestly\\, I'm not a huge Star Wars buff\\, but I can tell the difference between a good and a bad movie. This was one of the worst\\, most dissapointing movies I've ever seen.","true":true}
