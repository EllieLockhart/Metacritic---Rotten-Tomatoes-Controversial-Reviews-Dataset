Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me it felt like the story was written by multiple writers who didn't speak to one another. There is a significant plot hole later in the movie.  This snafu was previously explained but should not occur at this point in the movie.  This movie felt like a number of short stories tied in together.  I understand that the overall theme of the movie is that failure can lead to a spark of hope. Maybe episode 9 will be that hope.","true":true}
