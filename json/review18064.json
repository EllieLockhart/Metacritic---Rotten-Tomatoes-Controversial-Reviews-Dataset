{"101487":140834,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-27","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think to be more true to the character development of Rey and to make a more complex and interesting story\\, Rey should have joined Kylo and been the bridge to the light and dark side of the Force (if the theme of the movie was truly about balance). She even told Kylo \\\"you are not alone. I will help you.\\\" Why does she care about bringing him back from the dark side? She wants to help him\\, but doesn't want to join him\\, but wants to kill him....? The best part of the movie was the two of them taking down the red guards. Kylo's best acting was when he was pleading with her to join him. Also\\, Rey wasn't afraid to dive into the evil\\, dark hole beneath the island and only saw her infinite self - interesting\\, but what does that really tell us about her as a character? If she asked to see her parents and only saw herself\\, she realized she was the only one who mattered in her life\\, not her past\\, not her future destiny or choice\\, just her as she was and feeling extremely lonely for it. So now she is alone and tells Kylo that he is not alone...?\\n\\nIf the Jedi made a \\\"religion\\\" out of using the Force\\, and The Last Jedi is about abolishing the religious order of using the Force (if\\, as they say in the movie\\, the Force is the energy and balance between all living things)\\, then nothing is truly good or truly evil. Everything is just a grey power struggle and people get hurt on both sides. All you have to do to acquire the power of the Force\\, good or bad\\, is to stretch out your feelings....but then how come not everyone has the Force? Some have a genetic propensity for it\\, or is that not true anymore? If the Force is accessible to anyone with good or bad intentions\\, then that also seems to open the universe to chaos of a higher\\, destructive power. So then what is the point of resisting or rebelling or anything at all? What is anyone fighting against\\, or for?\\n\\nThis film didn't allow for the journey of character development (it did have the most boring space chase in the history of cinema\\, though - since when do fusion reactors run out of fuel?). Sure\\, characters were put in situations\\, but I don't feel any development happened to Finn or Rey\\, in my opinion. For instance\\, Luke joined Obi-Wan after his aunt and uncle died and he wanted to help Princess Leia\\, and he also abandoned his training with Yoda to save Han and Leia - his motivation was friendship and loyalty.\\n\\n\\nIt would have been awesome if Rey would have joined Kylo and she would start turning to the Dark Side\\, but HE would save her back to the light side. Now that is a movie I'd like to see! Also\\, Space Floating Leia was such a weird idea. It would have been way more powerful if she had died then\\, with Kylo having a guilty conscience that he spared her but didn't save her. Honestly\\, if they really wanted a new Star Wars saga\\, they should have not ever had any of the original characters come back at all\\, and just started episode 7 two hundred years into the future.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\nAlso\\, Luke's character seemed way off track...he was the one who risked everything to bring his father back to the good side\\, yet he didn't even allow Kylo a chance - he wanted to kill him. That doesn't even make sense with his character. Luke is not the type to just give up on people. It was an entertaining film\\, just not a \\\"Star Wars\\\" film.\u00a0The original trilogy was 100% typical good vs evil\\, destiny vs choice....it relied on tried and true tropes that have been the building blocks of all the enduring and most meaningful stories - good winning over evil\\, and narrative arcs that made sense with an emotional payoff. You can't take out the structure and mythology of Star Wars and expect it to be Star Wars. It feels hollow\\, because it has all the appearance of it (sounds\\, space ships\\, storm troopers)\\, but there is nothing holding it together.\u00a0What is the purpose of this story? Nothing was connecting and I don't feel confident in where this is going - it feels like a road trip with no plan. What's the point of fixing chaos if there will never be any peace?\u00a0\\n\\nOne last thing...talk about characters being trashed\\, Yoda even said to Luke before he went to Cloud City in TESB\\, \\\"If you leave now\\, help them you could; but you would destroy all for which they have fought\\, and suffered.\\\" And then in this movie\\, Yoda tells Luke that Rey has everything she needs\\, so he force lightnings down the jedi tree. lol. So training is not that important anymore? Recklessness and irresponsibility are the new themes of Star Wars - wielding a power you haven't mastered for a selfish purpose undermines the very core meaning behind what made the original trilogy so enduring.\u00a0\\n\\nFinally\\, ACCIO BROOM!!\u00a0","true":true}
