Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A thematic mess! There are two major missteps: the central theme lacks weight given the state of the franchise and the central plot falls apart upon thinking about it too hard.\\n\\n\\\"Let the past die\\\"\\, Kylo Ren\\, Luke Skywalker\\, and Rian Johnson say. Narrative moves hack critics call \\\"bold\\\" are taken - Luke Skywalker is a shadow of his former self and dies a failure at peace with his failure\\, Yoda burns books\\, Admiral Ackbar dies. However: there's still X-Wings and Tie Fighters\\, cool colored lightsaber fights warm colored lightsaber\\, the Millennium Falcon runs around\\, and Princess Leia and Chewbacca chew the scenery. The past cannot die - it is in fact exploited continuously and will seemingly be exhumed each year courtesy of Kathleen Kennedy. \\n\\nSimilar to the later seasons of \\\"Game of Thrones\\\"\\, logistics become a central part of the plot. Like those later seasons\\, they are incorporated haphazardly . Johnson attempts to show a war effort on its last legs\\, but the 9th (10th with the cartoon) showing in the franchise is a weird time to have fuel be something people worry about. Additionally: why didn't Finn's party just jump to another planet\\, pick up gas\\, and head on back? Why didn't Holdo tell the ace pilot and icon of the Resistance that they were going to mount a counterattack on a nearby planet so that Finn's group wouldn't result in half the Resistance dying? Why didn't the force ghosts of every Jedi just kill Sidious after Order 66? Why didn't the First Order just carry out an orbital bombardment on Salt Hoth\\, like they did at the film's beginning to tremendous effect? Why do critics pretend this isn't just as much of a rehash as its predecessor just because Hoth happens at the end and the throne room scene from \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\" happens at an earlier point in time in the trilogy?","true":true}
