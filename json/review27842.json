Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Peter Ranier says \\\"The fanatics will love it.\\\"  I'm a fanatic\\, and it was the absolute worst of all the Star Wars movies.  I'm not snobby - I actually liked huge parts of the prequels.  I liked Rogue One.  I liked the Force Awakens.  I absolutely despised this movie - not just as a Star Wars movie\\, but as a movie in general.  I'm not going to write a huge review\\, and no\\, I'm not comparing it to the first trilogy.  I wanted it to take a new direction.  This just happens to be absolutely the wrong direction because it was so horribly done.","true":true}
