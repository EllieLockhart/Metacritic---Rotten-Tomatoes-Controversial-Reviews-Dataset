We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"(warning - spoilers ahead)\r\rFrankly\\, I don't understand why so many users give it a bad review. I guess they missed the point for some reason. Raging like that on a game like this just does not sound justified to me.\r\rAgreed\\, P1 was an exceptional strong story\\, the ending was exceptionally engaging\\, and the follow-up to it was superb.\r\rP2 is about something else. It's not about a satisfying end\\, people getting what they want\\, dancing unicorns on a infected rainbow.\r\rIt's about paranoia\\, mental decay\\, people going nuts in a world gone beyond nuts. It gives us insight in two people coping with this daily sledgehammer of mental abuse in their own way. And the interesting part is that those two people's lives are entwined in something resembling a chaotic death spiral of revenge and spite.\r\rThere's a (ugly\\, nasty\\, cringy) beauty in that. How they cope with their challenges\\, the injustice& losses they endure. It makes this story about a antagonistic struggle of GOD (capable of mercy\\, even when she sees so much death and inhumanity) vs the DEVIL (can't get closure on the death of a loved one who she can't forgive for what he's done) - it's complicated.\r\rAbby beating Ellie at her game (being sneaky)\\, then Ellie beating Abby at hers (brawling) is some kind of genius master plot awesomeness I have not seen often. Which fit perfectly in the antagonistic clash of them both against each other. We had the privilege being part of that process\\, understanding how it shaped their actions and their own sanity.\r\rIt made me frustrated and sad to see what Ellie has become.\rIt made me feel relief that there is still sanity in that distopic world by seeing Abby make the arguable mistake of giving mercy twice\\, even though it cost her all her loved ones. Even though I thought she just was a generic 'baddy' at first.\r\rMaybe that is why so many people are so frustrated and give this title a bad score. They don't like what Ellie (and being the player\\, they themselves) become. Or maybe they just don't understand what the story is about.\r\rThat's the danger of a story that's not aimed to please the viewer. They might get frustrated\\, or just miss the point.\r\rBut that just makes this game a misunderstood *masterpiece* to me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
