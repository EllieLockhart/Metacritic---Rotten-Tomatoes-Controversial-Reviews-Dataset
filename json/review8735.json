Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all the positives and things done right\\, the whole casino sequence and above all\\, how poorly handled Luke was completely ruined the movie for me. Luke always was the optimistic hopeful one\\, he managed to turn Darth Vader\\, he would never lose hope and give up on the force\\, his friends and his sister just because Ben turned to the dark side.","true":true}
