Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi had so much potential\\, and inappropriate quips\\, lazy writing\\, and bad storytelling have left much to be desired. The movie is visually spectacular\\, the acting is wonderful\\, and John Williams never fails to impress. The lunacy of several major plot points make this movie hard to enjoy. The prequels\\, in all their flaws\\, expanded the universe to be so much more than what we knew from the original trilogy. This new trilogy has managed to reduce the scope of our favorite galaxy far far away to feel small and unimportant by scaling down the size of the galactic conflict. Please just make a normal Star Wars movie and let Seth MacFarlane and Mel Brooks do the comedy.","true":true}
