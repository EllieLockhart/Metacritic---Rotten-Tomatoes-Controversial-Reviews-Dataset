Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good things about this movie are few. Good visuals\\, amazing music and an awesome fight between Rey and Kylo against the imperial guards.  Does not feel like a Star Wars movie at all. They are not trying to make something new they just recreate something from the original trilogy and throw the prequels in the trash can. Try something new for f*** sake! We don't want to watch the original trilogy but with better visuals. That is basically what they are doing. I wish i could travel back in time and tell George to never sell LucasFilms to f****** Disney.","true":true}
