Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold new direction for Star Wars that does not pander to fanboy entitlements...which ends up being a very good thing. Bold\\, brazen\\, unexpected...with some of the best production design and CGI execution of any of the Star Wars films (hello prequels - this is how it should be done)...as well as some of the finest acting performances ever given in a Star Wars film (finally\\, the actors are allowed to ACT). Hamill gives one of the finest performances of his career\\, and even at his own personal hesitation at first\\, shows that even the greatest of heroes are human. Bravo to Rian for showing that 30 years of life actually affect a human being...even our beloved hero.\\n\\nAnd bravo again to Rian for showing us that the galactic conflict\\, and its effects\\, are not just the territory of the outer rim and the political establishment. The Canto Bight segment of the second act is a peak into the \\\"1%\\\" of the Star Wars society that often doesn't get much coverage\\, but still plays a pivotal role in the galactic conflict while living within the privilege of not being affected by it and built upon its very oppression. As well as putting Rose's character\\, as well as the role of the Resistance\/Rebellion\\, in even greater context. Not to mention a stunning a piece of production design that harks back to the golden age of Hollywood film production. Unfortunate that this act seems to be so misunderstood by so many.\\n\\nIf Star Wars is to continue\\, it has to take risks and go to new places. Not surprising that a great portion of the fanbase isn't ready for that. Overall\\, quite ironic that the message at the heart of the film has gone over the heads of most of the fanbase - a film about wrestling with the past in order to embrace a new future - a future not beholden to expectation or entitlement or legacy\\, but one rooted in taking risks\\, in evolving...in growing up.","true":true}
