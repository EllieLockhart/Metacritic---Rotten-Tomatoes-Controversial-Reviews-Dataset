Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was basically a mix of Empire Strike Back and Return of the Jedi. Yes Snoke\u2019s and Luke\u2019s death was disappointing. I loved all the action and Rey\u2019s journey into a Jedi. It was fun and amazing. I really hope Episode 9 ends it once and for all","true":true}
