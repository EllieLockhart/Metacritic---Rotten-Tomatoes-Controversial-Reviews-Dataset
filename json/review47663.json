Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When your subconscious tries to suppress the memory of watching this farce\\, you know its bad.  I left the theater so numb it took me 24 hours to fully register what had just happened.    Nothing else to add to the massive negatives of this \\\"movie\\\" that have not already been addressed.  The office I work at is just across the street from a movie theater and it was hard for me not to yell at my co-workers not to go see this movie\\, despite the fact most had pre-purchased tickets.  There return to the office could only be described as a funeral per cession.\\n\\nI love how the critics and media outlets point out how successful the movie is based on ticket sales.  Really???  This movie could have just been a 2.5 hour movie with a giant ass on the screen\\, staring back of the audience\\, and it still would have made 200+ million...  the ticket sales are not from THIS movies story but rather TFA story and saga as a whole.  \\n\\nHey Disney\\, I wrote a script for Episode XI.  IT took me all of an hour just like Johnson's written script from this colossal mess.\\n\\nEpisode XI  Attack of the Orphans\\n\\nAfter space crawl explaining how the galaxy is on the verge of progressive enlightenment\\, the scene shifts to the Melenium Falcon drifting in space.\\n* Inside the falcon\\, the remaining 10 members of the resistance are passing judgment on Chewbacca\\, who has been accused of an found guilty of killing and attempting to consume a sentient being.  For his crime\\, Chewbacca is flushed into the vacuum of space.  Unfortunately\\, he does not have the force to save him.\\n*C3-PO and R2-D2 are the only two who object to the verdict and are immediately destroyed and used to construct a much needed second bathroom in the falcon (a quick vote also officially changes the name of the falcon the the \\\"Millennial Falcon\\\").\\n*General Liea gives everyone remaining a participation trophy then quietly disappears down the hallway of ship\\, never to been seen again.  (see I removed the last pieces of the saga in the first ten minutes)\\n*Rey takes command and using her new godlike (excuse me\\, godess like) force powers\\, force projects the Millennial Falcon back to Jakku.\\n*After arriving at Jakku\\, Rey renames the Resistance\\, Tolerance (with a upper T).  Tolerance beings to enforce strong environmental regulations to combat global warming.\\n*Soon after taking control of the planet\\, Rey finds Poe guilty of overly manly thoughts and must decide of getting a sex change\\, so he can better understand of plight of an oppressed female or Poe must work 25 years of hard labor in an environmental work camp.  Poe chooses the latter.\\n*Because of his status of a minority\\, Finn is allowed to remain with Tolerance but  must never speak or have any thoughts of his own.\\n*Rose realizes she is actually in love with Rey and only had feelings for Finn because of society peer pressure.\\n*meanwhile Kylo is still stuck at the abandoned rebel base that Tolerance escaped from.  Since the only female in the First Order was killed off\\, frustration mounds as all the white males remaining in the First Order do not have enough intelligence to figure out how to leave the planet.  \\n*Hex\\, in a sudden flash of brilliance\\, advises Kylo to order all remaining First Order personnel to refer to themselves as gender fluid.\\n*After Kylo gives the order (known as order #metoto) he contacts Rey on Forcetime with news of his\/her revelation.  Delighted that Kylo has enlightened himself\\, Rey orders Uber for all First Order forces and they travel to Jakku to meet with Tolerance.\\n*After Kylo and Rey meet at Jakku\\, force ghost Luke Skywalker appears to both of them.  Luke wants to finally impart with final wisdom of the force to them.\\n*Incensed by Luke's remark that he somehow can so a Millennial anything\\, Rey convicts Luke of white privilege and sentences him to imprisonment.  In a shocking twist\\, and surprise cameo\\, the new ghostbusters appear and suck force ghost Luke into a trap and he his never seen again.\\n*The movies ends with the entire remaining cast holding hands and singing \\\"We Are the World\\\" and dancing around a large fire pit with anything remotely Star Wars burning intensely.","true":true}
