Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's about 5 minutes at the end of the film with Luke Skywalker that I enjoyed. That felt like the Star Wars scene we'd wanted.
