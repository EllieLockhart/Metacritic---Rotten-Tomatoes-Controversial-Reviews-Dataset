Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an old school OG Star Wars fan I love what Rian Johnson has done with The Last Jedi. At last the shackles of the original trilogy have been removed to allow this story to move forward to its conclusion. I absolutely adore the original trilogy\\, I liked parts of the prequels and loved Rogue One. The Force Awakens brought about a re-telling of the story to a new generation and now The Last Jedi has shaken and stirred the story to bring in much needed freshness and a way forward. The wheel cannot keep being reinvented\\, we are 40yrs on and I applaud Rian Johnson for his decisions. It is also the most visually stunning SW film there has been. As Kylo says \\\"let the past die\\\".","true":true}
