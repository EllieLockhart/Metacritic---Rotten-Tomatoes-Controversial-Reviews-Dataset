Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Disney script writers\\,\\n The audience will not fear the bad guys when they fall for idiotic plot devices like prank phone calls. And we will not root for the good guys when they are so unbelievably stupid. And speaking of unbelievable\\, you really only have so many \\\"I can't believe that happened\\\" moments in a film. I would advise you not to blow your load in the first 5 minutes.\\n\\nIf you want to see the definition of \\\"trite\\\" illustrated hundreds of times over and over until you feel like screaming at the screen\\, then watch this movie. It was so bad it made me nauseous.","true":true}
