Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it a bit different sure. People would be pissed if it was more of the same. And in no way does it stretch too far from being a proper Star Wars movie. Minor issues and perhaps 1 or 2 troubling scenes but overall incredibly satisfying.","true":true}
