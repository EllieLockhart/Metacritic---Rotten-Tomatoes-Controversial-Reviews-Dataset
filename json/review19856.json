Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was awful. If it didn\u2019t have Star Wars in the title it may not have even made it into the cinemas - straight to DVD. Personally\\, (spoiler) I cringed at the absurdity of a body being able to be blown into space but yet able to disregard instant solidification and come back alive. I realize it\u2019s Sci-fi but even within the realm of fantasy I suspect many audiences are too sophisticated to banish all elements of reality within a story. I\u2019m not surprised by the low audience score.","true":true}
