Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never before had I such an urge to register and write a review about a movie. Why care? Really. But after seeing TLJ I couldn't resist. \\n\\nThis movie sucks major balls. I am neither a Trump supporter\\, nor a racist\\, nor asexist. Yet i feel annoyed about the political lectures this movie tries to enforce upon me. Even while writing this review about a movie that in my honest opinion was the worst Star Wars Movie ever\\, I feel the pressure to defend myself. So here\\, I am a Bernie supporter and live as a foreigner in a different country. \\n\\nSo what is so bad about this movie? \\n\\nWell\\, SPOILERS incoming! You have been warned. \\n\\nYou take the heroes of the past and sh1t all over them in the most dis-respectable way possible. Grumpy old man Luke\\, who believed and succeeded as a young man to turn the most evil guy in the Galaxy towards the light side\\, is now ready to kill a kid who has a tendency towards the dark side\\, a tendency not strong enough to kill his mother btw... This broken Hero and potential child killer milks a disgusting looking alien\\, which seemingly enjoys it\\, and goes on fishing with the most dramatic music ever. He tells the new hero\\, Rey\\, phuck the Galaxy\\, phuck yourself and leave me alone. Yeah\\, great portrayal there. I wonder who brainwashed the Luke from the original trilogy and made him such a huge arse. \\n\\nBombs that fall on the biggest Ship you have seen in a most natural way\\, through an open door where a girl is just breathing in the vacuum of space. \\n\\nLaia Merry Poppins reanimating her frozen and dead body in space and showing Superman how it is done\\, the flying I mean.\\n\\nA love story hinted on Rey and Kylo that feels as forced as the retarded jokes\\, which come BTW in the most unfitting moments. \\n\\nPlot holes and coincidences along a race through space at speeds you can only describe as suspend animation. Characters no one can really cares about\\, Rey was likable in TFA (which I would give a rating of 85% BTW) even though she was a Mary Sue character. She still had this mystery\\, you know what this mystery is all about? Nothing\\, she is a nobody\\, that nobody loved or cared about. That's all we learn... This was the char I had the greatest hopes for\\, from all the new chars. \\n\\nPoe is an idiot\\, we get it\\, he needs the guidance of strong woman\\, we get it. Don't care about him. But why not tell him about this plan of Holdo\\, I mean this is all the resistance has left anyway\\, there is no room for treason anyway. \\n\\nRose and Finns journey to the place where all the evil weapon sellers and real life caricatures of real life billionaires enjoy their lives by enslaving animals and children. Yeah Disney\\, we got this hint\\, it's no rocket science to force-feed us this great revelation with a 50 minutes spoon of wasted lifetime. \\n\\nActually\\, this movie was meaningless. The plot was stupid and could be done within 30 minutes. Old characters are only there to be shit on\\, new chars are boring emos who have no reason to exist except to explain us why the political view of Disney is the right one and everything else is just there to sell merchandising products (like those ultra creepy porgs) after you watched this 2 hours and 50 minutes sh1tfest.Thanks for nothing Disney\\, except for ruining another franchise and phuck you. Leave our real life politics out of the Galaxy far far away and try to tell a story next time.\\n\\nStar Wars is dead\\, long live the Social Justice Wars or whatever this was supposed to be. And yeah\\, Disney can buy the critics before it hits the theaters to lure us into this sh1t but it's not bots\\, nor right wing people\\, nor man\\, who tend to disagree with you. Try to exucse this pure rating as much as you want\\, truth is\\, you are just a bunch of manipulative\\, greedy basterds who don't give a sh1t about the chars from SW or the franchise itself.","true":true}
