Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie in the series. Remember all those cliffhanger unanswered questions you wanted after the last movie? Well they answered all of them with the dumbest answers ever. And did they steal this story from an episode of Battlestar Galactica? Save your money and don't bother seeing this junk in the theater.","true":true}
