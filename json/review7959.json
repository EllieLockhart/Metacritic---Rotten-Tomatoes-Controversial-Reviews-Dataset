Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointing. Since The Force Awakens\\, I had been so looking forward to this movie. They had such a great opportunity with this movie but instead they absolutely ruined it. There are so many things wrong with this movie I couldn't even begin to list them all. All I can say is it's been a week since I've seen it and I still feel let down and disappointed. I no longer have any desire to watch another Star Wars movie.","true":true}
