Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A really amazing Star Wars film that reignited my Star Wars fandom. Seriously I hadn't bought an EU book since ROTS bc I thought it was dead. TFA was boring and overly nostalgic. This film inspired me to immediately buy new canon books and merch like never before. LOVE IT!","true":true}
