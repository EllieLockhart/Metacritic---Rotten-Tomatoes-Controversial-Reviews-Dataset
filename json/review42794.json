Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was made with no thought or knowledge of the series' characters or the galaxy in which it takes place. Luke Skywalker's character is fundamentally different and ruined. I've loved star wars for over twenty years\\, this single film has made me lose all interest in the series. ","true":true}
