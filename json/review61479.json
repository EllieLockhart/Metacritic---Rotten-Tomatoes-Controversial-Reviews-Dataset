Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"TLOU1 was one of my favorite narrative games of all-time and while I felt it should stand alone on its own without any sequels\\, I was excited to have another outing in that world with those characters. Unfortunately\\, that wasn't the game we got. The promotional material for it was misleading as were most of the articles about it. This game is 90% about unrelated characters who had no part in the story until they were tossed in\\, here. The game mechanics have no noticable improvement over the first game\\, nearly a decade ago. The writing hinges on \\\"OOH\\, I\\\"M SUCH AN AUTERE -- YOU DID ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS IN THE FIRST GAME\\, DONT YOU FEEL LIKE A BAD PERSON?\\\". I mean. No. As a player\\, I have no agency in TLOU. Those are all narrative decisions made by the writing team. They're the ones who chose to do terrible things and indulge in torture porn. Also\\, saving the life of a child who was given no say in their future is hardly a \\\"grey area\\\"\\, even though Druckman (a man who clearly thinks a child belongs to the sate first and the parents second) implies that the choice is a dirty one which has inherent guilt\\, leading to the deserved ending of that character.\r\rEverything about this game was terrible\\, except the voice acting\\, music\\, and some of the graphics. But the meat of the game itself and everything surrounding it was just a huge let-down. I do hope that Druckman is finally called upon by Hollywood to go make movies. . . and never returns to video games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
