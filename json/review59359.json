The Last of Us Part II gives you raw emotion\\, human nature\\, flawless combat and a story that fills a void you didn't know was there. The themes are brutal in nature\\, with the root being forgiveness and revenge. The combat is smooth\\, seamless and has many different options - including the new prone feature to allow you to hide in long grass and under vehicles. The story is hard to play\\, leaves you wanting more\\, but is absolutely fulfilling on both ends. It really does show you how hate can consume you\\, and that forgiveness is the true route to freeing yourself of that consumption. This game is\\, without a doubt\\, a must play. There are so many parallels between the characters and between the first game. The characters are relatable\\, especially for LGBT+ youth. Seriously. Play it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
