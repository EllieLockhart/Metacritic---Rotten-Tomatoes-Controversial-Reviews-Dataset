Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An EXCELLENT strike down of my childhood's favorite story and the future of the saga. SUPERB display of deus ex machina. UNMATCHED demonstration of dropped plot lines and poor dialogue. TRIUMPHANT in its ability to destroy some of the most popular characters in the history of cinema. \\n\\nI'm afraid I agree with Mark Hamill when he said\\, \\\"I told Rian\\, 'I fundamentally disagree with virtually everything you've decided about my character.'\\\"","true":true}
