Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing short of a terrible addition the franchise that shrinks the Star Wars universe with a shoddy attempt at being unique. It tries too hard to modernize an OT feel\\, but the plot remains a hot mess. Shoehorned characters\\, bad writing...disappointing.","true":true}
