Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This director crapped all over Luke Skywalker's legacy. So disrespectful to all that came before. This new trilogy has made all the story gains of the original trilogy null and void. The story of Star Wars is literally back to square one. This makes absolutely no sense.","true":true}
