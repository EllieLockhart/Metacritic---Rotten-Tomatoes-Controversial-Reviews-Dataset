Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The star wars franchise is getting really boring. How many times would we rehash same plots and subplots. Rebel bases on white planets attacked by walkers. two sword bearing gentlemen squaring off in a throne room. Rebel fleet escaping a cordon. Smugglers and thieves being found in a casino or a bar. A reluctant teacher and pupil. Not a single new thing emerges from this movie worth remembering.","true":true}
