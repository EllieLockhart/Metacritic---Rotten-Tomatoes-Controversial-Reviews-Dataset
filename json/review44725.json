Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trashed the legacy of the previous 7 mainline films + Rogue One and Solo.   Didn't answer the questions set up in The Force Awakens (which was excellent)\\, also some plot points either make no sense or add nothing to the series.  Total trash.","true":true}
