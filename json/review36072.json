Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi took 40 years of anticipation and flushed it for a director to feed his ego instead of understanding that he wasn't making a single movie...he was gifted a chapter in a story already in progress...and he decided to \\\"subvert expectations\\\"....well done\\, I expected a saga\\, I got a sack of sh_t.","true":true}
