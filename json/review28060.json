Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, wasted opportunities...looking at you Snoke\\, and absurd PC pandering subplots\\, Casino & Rose. Luke should have had more screen time\\, showing off epic training\\, instead easier to make Rey an even more obvious Mary Sue. She must be the new chosen one. After all a white male saving the galaxy would be wrong in the current political climate.","true":true}
