Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Contrary to what critics say\\, this film does not honor the legacy of Star Wars. It insults the spirit of Star Wars and I felt deeply betrayed when I came out of the theater. \\n\\nThe actors do a wonderful job with what they were given and their performances were the only redemption. Unfortunately\\, those actors were given a script which was 75% comedy\\, quips\\, and gimmicks.\\n\\nI suppose I would say the tone of the film was inappropriate for a genuine Star Wars adventure.","true":true}
