Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian had no idea what he was doing. Garbage. Absolute garbage. The first time I didn't go to see a Star Wars film four or more times in the theatre. Not interested. My child wasn't interested in the toy line for the first time after seeing a Star Wars film. Disney needs to clean house and install a council of fans to monitor any future rogue \\\"Directors\\\" in the future. They should have halted this piss poor production. Insulting the base didn't expand the market in Asia? Maybe LucusFilm or Disney needs help understanding what they are doing as they are doing it. Oversight is a good thing after a film like this hurts a franchise. Momentary cash in hand doesn't beat a steady stream of income from a river that runs from the far off horizon.","true":true}
