{"101487":140033,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It aimed to be disheartening\\, but it ended up being disenchanting. Disenchantment is the key to understanding this film's failure.\\n\\nHere's what Lucas understood about his Star Wars movies that Disney and Johnson apparently don't: Star Wars is partly a human story\\, yes\\, but it is also partly archetypal. The struggle between light and darkness\\, good and evil\\, as primeval and eternal ways of being\\, is the essential backdrop of these films. Although the human (and alien) characters may embody mixes of them\\, and although individual characters may express skepticism (Han Solo)\\, the thrust of the films themselves cannot question the metaphysical underpinnings of the Star Wars universe without changing their very meaning. In the Star Wars universe\\, we are in the ancient halls of gods and demons (or Jedi and Sith) - that is\\, of primeval eternal archetypes. Yes\\, it appears as sci-fi\\, but the lightsabers\\, starships\\, alien beings\\, and even the Force itself\\, are just trappings\\, not the mystical substance of Star Wars. If the gods and demons are now to be banished - in some pseudo-enlightened move - to the realm of make-believe\\, the veil of mystery is rent. All the earlier conflicts are now seen not to have the significance they were thought to have - and appear even in a nihilistic light.\\n\\nThis is precisely what the Last Jedi does. The battle between light and darkness is reduced to battling political ideologies (admittedly\\, one of them very unsavory - but a far cry from archetypal). Knowledge of the \\\"ways of the Force\\\" ceases to be the fruit of a life of sacrifice\\, training\\, and dedication\\, and turns into some fluffy nonsense like consciousness of what's always been inside you. The top baddies no longer seem cool and seductive - instead appearing sort of weak and buffoonish - and the goodies don't give us much reason to care about their struggle - except for being agreeable\\, and against the authoritarian\\, weapon-happy other guys. And that should neatly explain why critics and fans are so split over this film. By itself\\, The Last Jedi mostly succeeds as an entertaining\\, engaging\\, visually vibrant film. But\\, as a successor to Lucas' trilogies - which it purports to be - it goes about grimly undoing the metaphysical fabric out of which they were knit. No doubt some people will protest that that is artistic\\, interesting - that it opens new possibilities for what Star Wars can be. The point is\\, that isn't Star Wars.\\n\\nIf Disney and Lucasfilm feel they can't make all new Star Wars stories without changing the meaning of the original films\\, then they suffer from a lack of imagination - a possibility already on its way to becoming a certainty\\, as displayed in the lazy rehashing of familiar plot motifs in their last attempt at an \\\"Episode\\\" film - and they ought to hire new writers who actually understand what makes Star Wars... Star Wars: It's not blowing up a planet-destroying super-weapon at the end. For a third time. It also certainly isn't \\\"blowing up\\\" the film's metaphysical core in order to make a different kind of movie that cosplays as Star Wars.","true":true}
