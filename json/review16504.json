Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must be Honest; my biggest problem in this movie was Luke Skywalker in this Movie\\, his character is all wrong. that being said The original characters are good\\, the new story is good\\, for all the whining about this movie a lot of it is smoke and mirrors from people who are neither versed in the Star Wars universe nor in the original Movies (which themselves had many flaws) i feel that these movies would have been much better had they not even included the Old characters and just gave these guys their own story to stand on\\, more confidence from the writers and directors. the movie as a whole is fun\\, and worth it. it felt like a whole new Star Wars movie.","true":true}
