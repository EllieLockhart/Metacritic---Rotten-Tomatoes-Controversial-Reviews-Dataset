Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While definitely stronger than it's predecessor\\, as well as boasting some strong visuals and direction by Johnson; The Last Jedi still can't quite soar to the levels of the original's it so desperately wishes it can with a dull second-act\\, as well as some meaningless plot lines. The film truly kicks into high-gear in it's last forty-five minutes. As for the changes and twists\\, it isn't as shocking or heartbreaking as fans would make you believe\\, a lot of overreaction is definitely present. When it's good\\, it is really good! But when it's bad\\, it's really bad. \\n\\n2.5\/5 stars","true":true}
