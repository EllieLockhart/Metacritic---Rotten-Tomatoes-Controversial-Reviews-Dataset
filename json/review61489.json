This story is about how the actions of Joel and Ellie affect the world around them.6)Due to the way certain scenes are placed throughout the game\\, after few hours of the game when I assumed the control of Abby\\, I didn\u2019t want to play anymore but gradually as I was progressing\\, I grew closer to Abby even though what she did at the beginning was too dark.7)Abby\u2019s section in the game is the main focus and is around 10 to 15 hours. Abby is not a villain in this game\\, she is just trying to survive and protect the ones she loves. The later half of the game paints this very nicely.8)The game forces the player to experience the pain and discomfort by using excellent visual and sound effects. There are so many beautiful scenes in the game that I kept taking in-game screenshots.9)The only things that helped me keep going forward after our hero\u2019s death were the gameplay\\, graphics\\, music\\, cinematics fluid combat and the rope and dodge mechanics. Sound effects are so good\\, at the work bench upgrading the weapons feels like you are right there.10)At the very end no person in his\/her rightful mind would want the revenge that the player was promised at the beginning. I personally didn\u2019t want either of them (Abby or Ellie) to die. No way it deserves the review bombing it is getting.GAMEPLAY: 10\/10\\, GRAPHICS: 11\/10\\, SOUND: 10\/10\\, COMBAT: 10\/10 STORY: 8\/10(-1 feels dragged\\, -1 first 2 hours too dark).THE GAME IS A MUST PLAY (NOT FOR KIDS LITERALLY).\u2026 Expand","true":true}
