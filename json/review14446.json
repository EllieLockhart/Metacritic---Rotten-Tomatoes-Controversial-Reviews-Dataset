Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had to see this movie multiple times\\, double checking that it wasn't just nostalgia nor fandom that powered my enjoyment of it. Minus some pieces that honestly could of been taken out\\, looking at you Casino Planet\\, the movie is a great continuation and I believe set the building blocks for the next movie to be the climactic ending to a old story line we all very much need it to be to lead to new possibilities.","true":true}
