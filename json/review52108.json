Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing this movie twice I feel I gave it a fair shot. It's my least favorite Star Wars film. A good film but a terrible Star Wars movie. Rian Johnson wanted to destroy the norms of Star Wars. Congrats Mr.Johnson mission accomplished but that's not something I'd be proud of. Besides the obvious complaints that everyone has about the humor and canto bight\\, the film destroy's Luke's character. Luke would never consider killing his nephew at least not without talking to him first or Liea. Luke always wanted to help people that was established in the original triology. Also making Snoke a plot device after he had such great build up in the Force Awakens was another terrible decision. And this is the only Star Wars film with no lightsaber on lightsaber fight\\, so disappointing. I know Disney is running the show but show some respect for Lucas's vision as he said Star Wars has always meant to be the story of the Skywalker family. Also Rian Johnson should realize when you have a franchise as beloved as Star Wars what the fans want should be taken into account.","true":true}
