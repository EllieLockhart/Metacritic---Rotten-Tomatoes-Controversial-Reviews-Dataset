Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS: 34 years we have waited to see Luke Skywalker again and this is the story we get? A broken hermit who tries to murder his sleeping nephew?? A guy who has turned his back on everything he stood for? \\n\\nPlus all the other major writing\/plot problems in this film? Much of the plot seemed completely nonsensical and I wonder if Rian has ever seen a Star Wars movie before. I can't believe they're going to let him have his own trilogy. This movie does a major disservice to the original trilogy and the only good thing I can say about it is that it makes the prequels seem much better. I miss George Lucas.\\n\\nThis will be the last time I see a Star Wars movie in the theater for a long time. I suggest you save your money and don't support this horrible movie.","true":true}
