Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated it.  They tried to Disney up Star Wars\\, not make a Star Wars movie.  Kill off Snoke and the super storm trooper from Game of Thrones like they were an afterthought.  Very little new character development\\, time passes totally differently in the timeline\\, Days for Ren and Luke and a day for the rebels. Suddenly the empireis 9 ships only instead of a huge armada and Snoke is coming personally?  No\\, the supreme leader wouldn't do that\\, they'd be the last thing to go into battle or danger.   Hated it.  I'll take Rogue 1 any day over this or the Force Awakens.","true":true}
