Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very disappointing movie. It's totally out of context with the legacy of Star Wars and contradicts itself throughout the movie. The character development had tons of potential but they turned out to be as shallow as a cartoon and the writing is cringe worthy. It ruined the legacy and my interest in Star Wars from this point forward. Half a star because it did look good sometimes.","true":true}
