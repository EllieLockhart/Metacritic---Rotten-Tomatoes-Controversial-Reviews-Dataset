Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie but even more so the 2nd time. the 1st viewing I was stumped for words but after seeing it a 2nd time the day later I appreciated everything they did and all of the 'risks' they took.\\nfar from the worst Star Wars film but not top 3.\\nThere are some scenes that are the best they've ever been and this truly felt like Star Wars.","true":true}
