It is a very pretty game and I really like the fact that you can lose any character in any moment and the game doesn't give a second chance to 'revive' them. Die? Next.\r\rThe real problem with this game is the fact that it is not good optmized in the beginning. A lot of frame-drops will wait you in the early game\\, you can be sure. Other 'problem' is the fact that after the middle of the game\\, in the last 4 chapters\\, the game doesn't scare you anymore. When you finally see the wendigos\\, all horror goes away because you know what are trying to you kill. And the jumpscares doesn't scare like before.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
