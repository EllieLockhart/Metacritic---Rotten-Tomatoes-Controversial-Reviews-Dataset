Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A sometimes-dazzling romp and many nuanced surprises that will stick in your mind after the shiny stuff has gone. It meets your expectations while setting up a long story to come. Don't much care for the new ancillary characters (except DJ - Benicio is brilliant) but the chemistry between Kylo and Rey is delicious. Funnily enough\\, Kylo is  the more layered & dimensional of the two\\, but Rey is what she needs to be... And she is compelling. You need a deeper approach to truly appreciate this installment.","true":true}
