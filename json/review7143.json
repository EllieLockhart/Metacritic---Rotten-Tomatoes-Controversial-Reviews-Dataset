Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enjoyable to watch at first\\, but as you reflect more on it you start to see its flaws and shortcomings. Not only was the story poorly written\\, the characters of the original trilogy weren't fulfilled on their true potential. I would like to compare this to Valerian\\, how it was extremely visibly pleasing but lacked in all other aspects of movies. it's an extremely nicely wrapped Christmas present with nothing in it.","true":true}
