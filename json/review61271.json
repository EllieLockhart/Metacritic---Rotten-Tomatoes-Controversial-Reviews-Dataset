Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The gameplay was a big step up from part 1\\, much the same in a lot of ways but more fleshed out in terms of mechanics. The world design is also a step up\\, it really feels like a living environment. The graphics (as you'd expect) are also fantastic\\, probably one of the best looking games this console generation will see.\rBut the story...I so wanted to like it but after finishing it\\, I just don't feel happy or satisfied at all. I understand the shock and awe approach to Joel's death and what they wanted that to do but it just feels wrong. Troy Baker's portrayal of him is sublime and he needed way more screen time. I was going okay up to the end of Ellie's section and then to find out that the next half (literally half the game) was to be played as Abby\\, this new character who I couldn't have been less interested in\\, was such a put off.\rAgain I got that they wanted to show a different perspective of the entire story and blur the lines of morality but it just didn't work in my opinion.\rI also felt the roster of side characters wasn't as strong. The likes of Bill and Trish\\, Sam and Henry\\, were all what made the first game so special when combined with Joel and Ellie. But with this game it was all missing.\rI so wanted to love this game but I just don't\\, I really feel that they missed the mark with what mattered most in a sequel to part 1.\rI don't think there's any chance of a part 3 from here and I don't think I'd want it now anyway\u2026 Expand","true":true}
