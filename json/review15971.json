Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just to tell you how RIAN JOHNSON ruined my second favorite character\\, LUKE SKYWALKER.\\n\\nLuke was not a murderer. On the DEATHSTAR he learned the lesson of rage when he almost struck down THE EMPEROR. He would NEVER again go to BEN SOLO's home like MACE WINDU with an extended saber looking for a kill. Screw you RIAN JOHNSON. I trusted you based on your BREAKING BAD episodes but what you did to LUKE is sickening.","true":true}
