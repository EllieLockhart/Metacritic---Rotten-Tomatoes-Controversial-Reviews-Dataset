{"101487":146032,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen a lot of bad in the Star Wars Universe...A NEW HOPE was a great movie\\, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was one of the best movies of all time..RETURN OF THE JEDI had its flaws\\, but it stayed true to the Star Wars lore and its world even with the silly Ewoks...but the Prequels had issues this review doesn't have time for from Jar Jar Binks\\, to wasting a great Villain like Darth Mail to WTH is this midi-chlorians crap to bad acting and bad writing...But I will give it one thing...they at least had a story that went somewhere! However\\, in the back of my mind I pretended the prequels never happened...I was ok with that\\, it didn't hurt the Original Trilogy that started in 1977 for me...So when I heard DISNEY bought LucasFilms and had plans to do a final Trilogy I got goosebumps...where would DISNEY take Luke\\, Han\\, Chewy\\, Leia\\, R2-D2 & C3PO...I was excited  when JJ ABRAMS was taking on his childhood love of Star Wars...THE FORCE AWAKENS...was a great title...I imagined what the story would be about\\, what adventures these hero's would take on and when I did see the film I was satisfied\\, but not complete as I can't understand why Luke wasn't able to have one more adventure with all his hero friends before Han was taken from us\\, although I felt his Death was appropriate and justified for the movie. Overall I was holding my breath to see what would happen in the long awaited THE LAST JEDI release of RYAN JOHNSON'S take on JJ's Film. I was excited to see RYAN bring it all together and answer many of the questions JJ left up to us for two years as well as create new questions for us... GOD was I not only disappointed\\, I was devastated\\, not only by RYANS utter disrespect of everything JJ ABRAMS did\\, created and setup for episode 8\\, but the purposeful and methodical middle finger he gave to all the true devoted Star Wars fans who had been inspired by these films since the 70's. It's like RYAN didn't give a damn about our childhood heros\\, he didn't care about Star Wars History\\, it's Myths or it's lore. Just as he had Luke toss the lightsaber over his shoulder so did he do to the entire Star Wars universe and us. This was PERSONAL for RYAN JOHNSON and he was telling every single one of us...\\\"FU \\, this is my film\\, my story and I'm doing it my way and I don't give a hell what Star Wars means to you!\\\" Forget the fact it was a horrible story and plot\\, forget that ION REACTORS don't run out of Fuel\\, Forget that we see Leia for the first time use the force in a way greater than any Jedi or Sith lord in history and survive being ejected into space and frozen to death and do a MARRY F-IN POPPINS back to the ship\\, forget that when they open the cabin door to save Leia they don't get sucked out! O...did you know that was ADMIRAL ACKBAR in the background getting sucked into space with her? Yeah...me neither..WTF! Forget the fact that Ray isn't even a Jedi\\, but can best Master Luke...I mean why would Ray need training when she's a MARRY F-IN SUE! Hey...let's completely change the utter core and inner being of who LUKE SKYWALKER is..you know...the guy who put down his  lightsaber to save his father...the one that contributed to killing millions and was the most vile evil person in the Galaxy next to his Emperor! You know the one willing to give his life for his dad and put Faith in him while the Emperor electrifies and burns him alive? YEAH THAT LUKE! Yeah...let's have him Strike down his nephew for having a moment lapse of judgment because he thought he MAY be turning to the Dark Side! ARE YOU F-IN KIDDING ME?  Was this movie an F-IN NIGHTMARE or did I actually pay\\, sit down and watch this ABOMINATION! Don't get me started on the First Order not sending a few ships to lightspeed in front of the republic ships to block them...don't get me stared on the ZERO POINT PLOT of going to SPACE VEGAS and finding someone to break some imperial code crap because hey...The First Order can now track you into Hyperspace...really? Wouldn't you need the Tracker to be on the Republic ship to do that like the Falcon was tracked in A NEW HOPE? How the F did they make this crap up and everyone in production never stood up and said..\\\"THIS IS F-ED UP\\, WE CANT DO THAT!\\\" Did we really need the useless ROSE? What a PLOT convenience to have that code breaking criminal wait till FINN and Rose was there to Break out of the prison...ARE YOU KIDDING ME? And these two idiots trusted this scumbag? It's not even the guy they needed! WHY\\, WHY\\, WHY! CAPT PHASMA..WOW...didn't see that coming for five seconds\\, a mile away...funny how when that explosive happened PHASMA and Finn had been separated from fighting in the explosion\\, but next moment she is marching toward Fin with her Stormtrooper Guards from far away...WTF? Am I the only one pulling apart this Hack job of a film? Hey...HOLDO OR WHATEVER you purple hair bitch is called...hey let's be a bitch from the start and not tell anyone your escape pod plan so we can build some god awful tension that never needed to be there in the first place...but be the hero and die by turning your ship and launching into hyperspace into the First Order Fleet...not like you couldn't set the ship to auto pilot\\, get out in an escape pod or anything yourself...which by the way...would that not have been there perfect opportunity to use ADMIRAL ACKBAR!!!! WHAT A WASTE! Hey\\, where's LUKE? O\\, he's chilling on his little island playing force projections on that SALT WORLD...really\\, you mean he really didn't doge all those Walkers blasts and he wasn't really there to fight Kylo Ren? No\\, nope he wasn't\\, he chose to be a coward instead and not helping the rebellion in person and take on Kylo man to man...instead projecting himself was just too much for the Great JEDI MASTER and so he gave himself to the force like a F-IN FART IN THE WIND! Was Rose's true purpose just to save FINN instead of sacrificing himself to save the Rebellion? Just so we could hear that HYPOCRITICAL ATROCIOUS DIALOGUE BY ROSE? WTF!  O\\, LOOK WHO SHOWED UP in the FALCON...RAY...to lift some Rocks and Crap\\, how did that happen?...Hey\\, did she learn how to do that with her Jedi training by LUKE? Nope\\, nope\\, Ray didn't learn squat crap from LUKE...She's MARRY F-IN SUE remember! How can we HONESTLY attach ourselves to these unlikeable characters...They fought for nothing\\, they earned nothing\\, they learned\\, suffered and sacrificed nothing\\, yet we are suppose to have some connection to them as we did our Hero's from the past...IMPOSSIBLE! I could go on and on about this abomination of a film...My hate runs deep with this one and it will be very hard for myself and other true fans of Star Wars to return for more garbage like this...JJ ABRAMS has his work cut out for him...I WILL NOT be paying to see Episode IX...I may not even watch it period...we'll see\\, but I highly suggest DISNEY FIRE KATHLEEN KENNEDY and PULL this NEW TRILOGY from RYAN JOHNSON'S COLD DEAD HANDS and FIRE him from any future projects that have to do with STAR WARS....and LAST I leave everyone with this...Where the F is LANDO and WEDGE? Seriously where THE F ARE THEY! Rant over!...WAIT WAIT...Was SNOKE in this Movie? Why yes\\, yes he was...for 5 F-IN MINUTES...and Spoiler alert\\, he was cut in half and tossed in the Toilet like Ryan did to the rest of the Film! WTF...I think it's time I go suck on a Horse Mermaids tit and contemplate where the F this franchise goes from here!","true":true}
