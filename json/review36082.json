{"101487":175731,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was 2 1\/2 hours of missed opportunities.  Rian Johnson has effectively ruined the Skywalker legacy and crippled the Sequel Trilogy due to his 'bold' and 'unexpected' choices for Episode VIII...to the point I doubt JJ can save it with IX.  Sadly\\, I refuse to watch any film in Johnson's new trilogy because of how offensive this movie is. For all of it's faults and criticisms of being derivative\\, The Force Awakens was exciting\\, fun\\, and introduced enough new elements that set up the Sequel Trilogy brilliantly. All Johnson had to do was carry it through to a satisfying middle act.  Yet he throws it all (and I mean ALL) away and what he delivers is a terribly disjointed mess that dishonors just about every major character\\, the 7 films which preceded it\\, and the mythology of the Force itself.  This middle chapter feels like the middle finger.  When the star of your film says \\\"'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character\\\"...maybe you should have listened\\, and listened closely Johnson. When The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones have higher audience scores than your film (no matter how Disney and the press wish to spin it) you've made a major misstep.  I don't hate the prequels\\, nor do I demonize George Lucas. The Prequel Trilogy is far from perfect\\, but it is imaginative and fun and tells the backstory George had envisioned since the '70s.  Each episode builds on the previous one (as it should).  As I watched The Last Jedi\\, I kept wondering if Johnson had actually seen The Force Awakens.  And the character assassination of Luke Skywalker is simply unforgivable.  History will not be kind to this film and many die-hard fans will rue the day Disney threw out Lucas' original treatments (if they don't already).  I miss you George\\, I really do.  Help us JJ\\, you are our only hope.  \\n\\n(And no Disney\\, I'm not a bot\\, a troll\\, a Russian\\, a hack\\, a Hobbit\\, a Muppet\\, or anything else your marketing campaign has to say about fans who didn't like this film).","true":true}
