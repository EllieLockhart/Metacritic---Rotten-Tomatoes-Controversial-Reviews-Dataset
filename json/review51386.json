Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute trash!  If you loved the originals then you will likely hate this. All that Lore is thrown under the bus. Old characters are treated with contempt. They have absolutely butchered the character of Luke Skywalker making him out to be a coward and weakling who fears the new lead characters. Space fuel is a thing in Star Wars now? Felt like an episode of Battlestar Galactica and not in a good way.  Leia is a general now who is charge of the resistance military and Admiral Ackbar who lead the rebel fleet @ Endor is her assistant? Oh and she can fly in space (like Superman) !!","true":true}
