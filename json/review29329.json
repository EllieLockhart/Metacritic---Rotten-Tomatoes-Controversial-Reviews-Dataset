Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson and others involved certainly had an agenda in mind when they made this movie. The original story and the fans that brought the franchise where it is today were of no concern.  The visuals were impressive while Rey and Kylo almost got a chance to be truly interesting. We can't have that\\, though. We have to divert time into ruining the image of Luke Skywalker. Honestly\\, what's even\\,left to accomplish in the third movie? This story was not only boring and derivative. Its a spit in the face of decent long time fans who AREN'T arrogant petulant children like Rian Johnson. Honestly\\, you got off lucky with just a few poor telling reviews\\, Rian.","true":true}
