Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally frustrating and disappointing. The honourable thing to do would be for J.J. to remake the film with some of the scraps from VIII and new filming before moving on to IX. Give Luke the ending he deserves. Let General Aqbar put a fitting end to his lore arc by saving the fleet\\, scrap Admiral (who?) Holdo\\, etc\\, etc. This film puts the the most beloved cinema saga of our time on a road to nowhere. REMAKE !","true":true}
