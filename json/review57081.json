Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This garbage has completely turned me off of any future Star Wars movies.  I have zero investment in any characters that remain in this series and don't care what happens in the future with this franchise.  Congrats to Rian and Kathleen\\, you turned something that you could count on Billions of $ for years to come into a series that will fall apart now that you have effectively eliminated roughly half of the fan base.  Worst Star Wars movie ever\\, terrible story\\, what are supposed to be fan favorite characters now have no emotional connection to many fans any longer so I imagine a huge drop in ticket sales for Episode IX\\, I know who's money they won't be getting.  I can't imagine how anyone likes this crap.","true":true}
