{"101487":185967,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-26","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was absolute garbage.  If you're like me\\, you've read all the reviews\\, so I'll spare you reading 15 paragraphs:\\n\\n-Pointless story lines\\n-Leftist political agenda is rampant in the film\\n    *Casino scenes are finished off with the liberation of an animal in which Rose responds to the entire venture with \\\"now it's worth it\\\" after the animal wanders off.\\n    *The men are emasculated and made to look like testosterone filled bumbling idiots\\, Chewbacca is unable to eat a meal because of how cute a Porg is\\, and befriends them\\n    *Luke Skywalker is a shell of his former self\\, a crabby grumpy old man\\, who seems scared of the Force.  His story ends by choosing to trick the bad guy and avoid violence.\\n    *Rose essentially makes a \\\"love wins\\\" quote when she saves Finn\\n    *Admiral Holdo does a great job of putting the \\\"stupid man\\\" in his place before going kamikaze on Snoke's ship (but not before she and Leia have a sweet feminist moment).\\n-Slapstick comedy and useless CGI characters that add nothing to the film\\, which were worse than the Prequels\\n-So many plot holes\\n-Leia floats in space long enough to kill anyone\\, but somehow is able to use the Force (which she has never done before) to pull herself back into the ship and be saved\\n-The stupid crystal hyena creatures at the end......just awful\\n-Tried to look like Hoth\\, but not be Hoth.....worthless\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is aptly named.  Because this is the end of the Star Wars franchise.  The professional critics must not have watched the same movie I did.","true":true}
