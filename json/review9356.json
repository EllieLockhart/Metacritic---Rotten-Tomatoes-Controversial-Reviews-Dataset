Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gets 1 star for great visual effects. Other than that\\, it's by far the worst Star Wars film to date. The writing is atrocious and full of holes. The story goes absolutely nowhere. It's complete and utter ignorance of established Star Wars lore is insulting.  A bad movie on it's own\\, but an even worse Star Wars movie.  Avoid this movie like the plague.","true":true}
