Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it! This is the continued evolution of the Star Wars universe\\, so full of great moments and important details\\, that I will have to see it again to truly appreciate it in its entirety.  So many different characters to connect with\\, it was so great to see such variety represented on screen!","true":true}
