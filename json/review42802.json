Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was more interested in propagandizing me than entertaining me. I don't like this movie for that reason first\\, then there is the bad writing\\, the characters that have no depth\\, also the complete lack of creativity. They don't seem to even want to try to make this arc great as a Star Wars film\\, but instead\\, the filmmakers are trying to give us this sophomoric view of how girls rule and boys drool in this brave new world. I honestly liked Rey in the first movie. I felt like it was a good set up for the new arc. Was it going to work? Could've gone either way. Well\\, it failed...and apparently\\, it has failed big time with the true fans of Star Wars\\, both BOYS AND GIRLS.","true":true}
