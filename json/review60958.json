Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really don\u2019t want to do this but...This game really shoudn\u2019t be out. The story is about a revenge and even if this subject is easy\\, they messed up. We were lied about the story\\, the trailers were a manipulation. I wasted 250z\u0142 ~ 60$ on this game. Everyone wanted a story with Joel and Ellie but we got a story about Ellie\u2019s revenge. They made Ellie look like a bad character (killed dog and ofc she killed pregnant woman) but the main villan was showed like a hero (fe. helped kids\\, play with a dog etc.). And the ending\\, oh god\\, it\u2019s basically awful. Don\u2019t get me wrong because i support LGBTQ+ community but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Sony\u2019s LGBTQ+ politics but the amout of putting gay\\, trans etc. things is really unnecesary. They tries to make a good game but it turns out it was ****\u2026 Expand","true":true}
