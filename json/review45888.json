Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very well directed and creative\\, some fresh air in the star wars saga\\, this one makes up for the 'repetition' in the force awakens. You will enjoy yourself\\, even if there are some imperfections. Rian Johnson still got the saga back on track thanks to his vision of the star wars universe","true":true}
