Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Naughty Dog handled this game in such a poor manner it's depressing. Misleading the public any way they can in order to trick people into playing a game they think they're going to get when instead the directors wanted to kill people's hope for a game building up over the past 7 years all to be edgy and tell a somehow unfinished revenge story that becomes far too convoluted and whimsical with it's potholes and clearly forced narratives. That sentence was too long\\, much like this game. The message that was supposed to be conveyed here is fairly easy to grasp. It's all about perspective and how someone is going to be a bad guy in another story; but it never actually comes full circle and the choices these beloved characters made don't flesh them out or further this message\\, they just go against reason to try and prove it. The character of... Abbie? Abby? I don't even care about her. Anyways\\, you can't just have a character kill off what has been building up for years and expect many players to go into the experience with a smile and an open mind. I'm sure everyone was happy to see Abby shot by Ellie when you fail the stealth sequence in the theater\\, I know I sure was. Just watch some youtube videos on how this game just completely dissolves in it's own bile. Also people don't dislike this game because it has two lesbians in it they dislike it because the characters suck (Besides Jesse\\, bless that man) and people feel manipulated @game critics who can't understand people have different opinions from them and AREN'T racist\/bigoted. Thanks for nothing\\, upper management at Naughty Dog\/game directors\\, just make another Jak and Daxter or something.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
