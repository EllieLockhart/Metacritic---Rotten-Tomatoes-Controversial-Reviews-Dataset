Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is visually impressive. However the plot and the script are by far the worst of an movie in the franchise. Bad not in a small way but bad in way which will have huge implications upon the future profitability of the franchise. I will never watch this movie again and I will never buy it on DVD. I struggle to understand how this script was ever accepted. I guess it shows that people at the top of Lucas Film are blind to what makes a good movie. Surely at some point in its development somebody pointed out the problems in the script. The best thing that we can say about this movie is that we now know who shouldn't be involved in writing the script for the new movie. It would be great if the leadership of Lucas Film spent less time sniffing their own farts and spent some more time on self reflection.","true":true}
