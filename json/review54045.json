Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It just seemed like a pointless filler in the series. The characters and story seemed forced and ultimately I just didn't care about any of the people I'm supposed to be rooting for. Nothing makes any sense and it's all just a major let down. Now 24 hours after seeing the movie I only wish that I hadn't watched it. ","true":true}
