Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just because something is different doesn't necessarily make it good. While it was nice the director tried to interject some original thoughts into the movie\\, it came off like he was sacrificing plot for the sake of diversity for diversity's sake. There is nothing wrong with making a series more inclusive\\, but it just felt forced here. It's sad because I grew up with this series and hoped that Disney wouldn't do exactly what it did - turning the series into a cow and taking canon (such as Luke being one of the most powerful Jedi\\, and portraying him as a weak\\, buffoon to be bested by a barely trained Jedi simply to show us \\\"girl power\\\"). I feel like Disney would be better off just holding having each line of script being written by a random person and labeling that disjointed mess as \\\"episode 9\\\" and calling it a day.","true":true}
