Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had it's flaws\\, but overall\\, I found it enjoyable. \\n\\nSo did Episode IV\\, and Episode V\\, and Episode VI. All of these movies have flaws\\, and moments that make me gently shake my head. But there's that element of nostalgia mixed with solid acting (improved from the last movie) and excellent creativity. I believe the rating of 92% that I currently see on Rotten Tomatoes is correct- an A rating for sure\\, but perhaps just an A-.","true":true}
