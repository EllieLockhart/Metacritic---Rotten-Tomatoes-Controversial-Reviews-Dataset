Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it is not too bad. But it does not connect to Star Wars It more connects to Rogue one. I do not see the Luke from new hope or return of Jedi. Old age is not an excuse for being miserable\\, lost dignity\\, see his masters Yoda and Obi-wan. Some parts do not make sense: after return of Jedi\\, as the only Jedi\\, Luke together with Leia led the whole resistance army to the ground. Were they so bad at leadership? Kylo\\, trained by Luke\\, his uncle and also beating Luke with force\\, lost twice in fighting with Rey\\, who has little Jedi training. I do not buy the plot.","true":true}
