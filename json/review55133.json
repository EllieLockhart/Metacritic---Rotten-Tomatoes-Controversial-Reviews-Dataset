Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really looking forward to this film\\, after watching Force Awakens it just set up this film perfectly to answer all those teasing questions such as Reys heritage\\, snokes background and possible future and beautiful send off for Leia (Carrie Fisher)\\, Lukes involvement and how the years have advanced his powers as a jedi master. But sadly I was hugely disappointed and let down by this instalment I don't feel I got anything I was expecting from a Star Wars film and let me make something perfectly clear to all those who see change or a fresh new look a good thing\\, when It comes to expectations from a franchise that you have grown up with a have a real deep love for this change is NOT a good thing in fact it is VERY BAD the only thing I could liken this bereavement of a film to is having your parents spit\/divorce when you are a very young age yes I will eventually get over this but it is a deep scar in my memory to which will never fully heal. I was under a false illusion to believe everything would stay the same in my safe little space bubble when all of sudden my world has been torn apart and I can not do anything but carry the wound and hope I will become stronger for it. The next film has to be astronomically good to have any hope of repair and I know you had your reasons Rian but I do not think you are up to the task","true":true}
