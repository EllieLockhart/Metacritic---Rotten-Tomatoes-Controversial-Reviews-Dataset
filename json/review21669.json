{"101487":148011,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just a heads up: The Last Jedi is quite long. In fact\\, it's approximately 2 and a half hours long. That's neither good nor bad; I'm just stating a fact.\\n\\nI'm going to talk about the characters\\, plot\\, and humor of this great film. \\n\\nCharacters: With a few exceptions\\, the acting is really good. Daisy Ridley is a phenomenal actress. I could tell that she genuinely cared about her role as Rey. All of her facial expressions and tone match the plot and the dialogue perfectly. When Rey is angry\\, Ridley is angry. Mark Hamill is really good\\, too. Initially\\, he acts uninterested in the plot. That might sound bad\\, but it's actually good\\, because Luke is supposed to be uninterested at this point. Hamill starts caring more and more as the film goes on\\, just like his character. Later\\, he shows amazing chemistry with Carrie Fisher- they act just like you'd expect 2 siblings who love each other and haven't seen each other in years to act. They hug and express their sibling love for each other. That's the kind of chemistry that you have to be really talented to portray well. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega act just as well as they did in The Force Awakens. Their facial expressions look exactly like those of a sarcastic antihero and someone who's constantly trying to impress others\\, respectively. Their acting matches their personalities. Andy Serkis plays Snoke very sinisterly. The only characters who aren't great are Kylo Ren\\, DJ\\, and the Porgs. Adam Driver plays Kylo Ren very emotionally\\, which is good\\, but he acts a little too emo at times. He yells numerous times\\, and it's only sometimes warranted (i.e. in the highly dramatic scenes). Driver's performance reminded me of Hayden Christensen's; I should add\\, though\\, that it's not nearly as bad. It's a very mild version of Christensen. DJ's performance isn't bad\\, but it isn't good. Benicio del Toro delivers the lines lazily and half-heartedly. He didn't seem very interested in his role. The Porgs are a little too cute. I'm not going to explain why- I'm sure that you've already seen them. They're only there to be cute. There is no Watsonian reason for why they're there. However\\, they don't have a lot of screen time\\, so I was able to tolerate them\\, and you'll probably be able to tolerate them too.\\n\\nPlot: There are enough surprising twists to entertain you and keep you on your toes\\, and most of the questions raised by TFA are answered. That's not to say that it's totally conclusive\\, however; the ending is a good set-up for Episode IX. Yes\\, I know that that's vague\\, but I can't get more specific without spoiling it.\\n\\nHumor: This isn't the best Star Wars film\\, but it is the funniest one. I laughed my head off too many times to count. For example\\, at one point\\, Luke asks Rey where she's from\\, and she says that she's from nowhere. He replies\\, \\\"No one is from nowhere.\\\" She says that she's from Jakku\\, and he says\\, \\\"All right\\, that is pretty much nowhere.\\\" At another point\\, after inadvertently breaking a cart of the caretakers on Luke's home planet\\, Rey says\\, \\\"I don't think they like me\\,\\\" and Luke replies\\, \\\"I can't imagine why.\\\" Those are not the only funny moments\\, but I can't tell you all of them- this review is already pretty long.\\n\\nOverall\\, I give TLJ a 4.7\/5\\, and I would definitely recommend that you see it. (I would've rated the movie 4.7\/5\\, but this site didn't let me rate it as that\\, and a 4.5 was the closest it would let me rate it.)","true":true}
